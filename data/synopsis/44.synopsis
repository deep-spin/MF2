Clive Riordan, a wealthy London psychiatrist, learns that his wife Storm is romantically involved with Bill Kronin, an American. He resolves to exact revenge on both by committing the perfect murder of Kronin.
After kidnapping Kronin at gunpoint, Riordan keeps him prisoner for months in a hidden room accessed from a nearby garage while authorities mount a search for the missing American. During one of his daily visits to bring food and supplies, Riordan is unknowingly trailed by his dog Monty. Fearing that Monty might lead others to the secret location, Riordan resolves to keep the dog with Kronin. The doctor reveals to Kronin that he plans to kill him and dissolve his corpse in an acid bath. 
Riordan's plan appears to be succeeding until Superintendent Finsbury from Scotland Yard visits the doctor's office. Finsbury claims to be investigating the missing dog, but as the conversation drifts to the Kronin case it becomes clear that Finsbury harbors suspicions about Riordan. 
Feeling the noose tightening, Riordan decides it’s time to act and poisons Kronin, only to discover that he has trained Monty to empty the acid bath by pulling the plug chain. The police find Riordan’s car in the garage, which leads them to the hidden room and Kronin’s body. Realizing his plan has failed, Riordan resigns himself to his fate. Finsbury arrives to arrest him, revealing that Kronin survived and that Riordan has escaped a charge of murder.
