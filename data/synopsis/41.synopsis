Pepe le Moko is a notorious thief who, after his last great heist, escaped from France to Algeria. Since his escape, Pepe has become a resident and leader of the immense Casbah, or "native quarter", of Algiers. French officials, who arrive insisting on Pepe's capture, are met with unfazed local detectives who are taking a slower approach, led by Inspector Slimane.

Pepe begins to feel increasingly trapped in his prison-like stronghold, a feeling that intensifies after meeting the beautiful Gaby, who is visiting from France. His love for Gaby soon arouses the jealousy of Ines, Pepe's Algerian mistress.
