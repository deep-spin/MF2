1
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,162
Ellie?

2
00:01:19,288 --> 00:01:21,498
Ellie, hurry up!
We've only got five minutes.

3
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,958
I'll be right down.

4
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,896
I'd like to say a few words
about what's happened

5
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,982
to me over the past year.

6
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,526
You women may not sympathize.
You think men have it easy.

7
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,820
But that's where you're wrong.

8
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,948
Man is a very delicate
and sensitive mechanism.

9
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,908
If you treat him right,
you flatter him

10
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:00,037
and butter him up a little bit,
he's good for years.

11
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:01,997
But if somebody
rocks the boat...

12
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,877
Well, you know how it is, men.

13
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,963
You work hard for years,
trying to build a home,

14
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:14,051
raise a family, and then
comes one wonderful day

15
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:15,552
when, for the first time
in your life,

16
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,928
you feel you're a little
ahead of the game.

17
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:18,597
Things have eased up
at the office.

18
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:23,310
The kids are all set, married
or well along in school or both,

19
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,646
and you're raring to go.

20
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:27,481
You think of all
the wonderful things

21
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:30,275
you would have done in your life
if you just had time.

22
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:33,654
You go fishing.

23
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:35,739
You go big-game hunting.

24
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,450
You might even climb
Mount Everest.

25
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,952
Anyway, you're on
top of the world.

26
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,579
You begin to feel
you're a combination

27
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,539
of Don Juan and Columbus.

28
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,711
And that's just the moment
they choose to let you have it.

29
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,258
I remember it was
just a year ago today.

30
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:59,680
I caught my usual
commuter's train.

31
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,264
It was late, as usual.

32
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,684
It was such a beautiful day
that I let the bus go by

33
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:06,186
<i>and walked home
from the station.</i>

34
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,772
<i>It was one of those
first warm days in May</i>

35
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,108
<i>when everything seems
to come to life.</i>

36
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:14,069
<i>I felt particularly well.</i>

37
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,821
<i>I was thinking
what a lucky man I was,</i>

38
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,447
<i>with a nice house all paid for,</i>

39
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:21,118
<i>three children all paid for,
and a beautiful wife.</i>

40
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,289
Ellie.

41
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,125
- Oh, hi, Pa.
- Hi, boys. Hello, Del.

42
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,127
- Mr. Banks.
- Ellie, I'm home!

43
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,295
Coming.

44
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,048
<i>Ellie was radiant that night.</i>

45
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,967
<i>She seemed to be
floating on air.</i>

46
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:39,302
Stanley, what kept you?
It's late.

47
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:41,012
Such a nice day, I walked.

48
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,980
Stanley!

49
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,107
What's the matter?
Can't a fella kiss his wife?

50
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:56,653
Oh, you won't have time
to change.

51
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,904
We have to start right away.

52
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:58,989
Why? Where are we going?

53
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,657
Kay and Buckley asked us
to their apartment

54
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:01,658
for dinner tonight.

55
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,952
She phoned this morning,
said she had some good news.

56
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,954
Oh! Oh! Buckley put over
the deal, I guess,

57
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,080
with the chain stores, huh?

58
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,623
That plastic bag of his?

59
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,167
Oh, I don't think
that's their big news.

60
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:12,169
I think it's something
much more important that that.

61
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:14,504
More important than that? Why?
That means thousands of dollars.

62
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,757
I don't know. What could be
more important than that?

63
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,467
Something, nothing.

64
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:19,801
- Get my coat, will you, dear?
- Yeah.

65
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,052
Night, Tommy.
Night, Ben.

66
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:22,345
Good night, Mom.

67
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,181
Kay said she was sorry
she couldn't have you, too,

68
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:27,058
but she had to have Buckley's
father and mother.

69
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,518
- Is Kay gonna cook?
- Mm-hmm.

70
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,061
You better take
your bicarb with you.

71
00:04:30,187 --> 00:04:31,688
Oh, no.

72
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,648
- Oh, boys, don't keep Delilah.
- Son, son, your jokes

73
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,484
- get funnier every year.
- Stanley, please!

74
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:36,943
I promised her
she could go to the movie.

75
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,737
Ben, you drop her on your way
to the game.

76
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,573
Oh, and, uh, Delilah,
stack the dishes until after.

77
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,783
You'll miss the first
of the picture.

78
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,868
- Thanks, Miss Banks.
- Um, Tommy don't study too late.

79
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,078
Remember, if the rug man calls,
tell him to call --

80
00:04:47,204 --> 00:04:48,830
S-Stanley!

81
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,333
What's got into you?

82
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,751
It's spring.

83
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:55,378
It must be.

84
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,925
Yes, sir, we're in a rut, Ellie.

85
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,301
Not that it isn't
a pleasant rut,

86
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,636
but I think we ought to
get out of it.

87
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,346
You know, you're
a very beautiful woman, Ellie.

88
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,388
Why, Stan.

89
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,641
A very, very beautiful woman.

90
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,059
Trouble is, I never see you.

91
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:10,352
Come home at night,
you wanna know

92
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:11,478
if I've seen the hole
in the carpet

93
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:12,979
or whether I'll fix
the leaky faucet.

94
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,022
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,107
Oh, I don't mean that
it's your fault. No.

96
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,609
I think we ought
to forgot about it, though.

97
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,486
We ought to forget the house,
forget the whole thing,

98
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:20,987
go away and take a trip.

99
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,199
No reason why we can't.
We're as free as the air.

100
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,368
Kinda like when we were
first married.

101
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,787
Before Kay came along.

102
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,705
Only this time we're not broke.

103
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:31,957
We could even go to Europe.

104
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:34,376
I think we better wait
and hear what Kay has to say.

105
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,837
Honolulu! What about Honolulu?
That's the place.

106
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,463
- How about it, Ellie?
- We'll see.

107
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,881
Oh, sure.

108
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,969
Waikiki beach,
moonlight on Waikiki.

109
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,638
Flowers, ukulele, romance.

110
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,437
Well, I'm gonna call up that
travel agency in the morning,

111
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,189
find out about those trailers.

112
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,068
- Hi, there!
- Hello, darling!

113
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:03,655
<i>There she was, my Kay,
the darling of my heart.</i>

114
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,283
<i>I couldn't yet believe
she was a married woman.</i>

115
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,911
<i>She still seemed like kid to me
playing at keeping house.</i>

116
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,621
How are you?
You feeling alright?

117
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,957
Feeling alright?!
Look at her. How does she look?

118
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,083
Never looked better in her life.

119
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,960
Oh, thank you, Pops.

120
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,963
- How's he treating you?
- Oh, fine.

121
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,757
- You miss me?
- Hmm, don't talk.

122
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,342
- Hello, hello!
- Buckley dear.

123
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,970
<i>I was full of the milk
of human kindness that night.</i>

124
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,973
<i>I even looked at my son-in-law
with a friendly eye.</i>

125
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,933
<i>I don't say
that he was my ideal,</i>

126
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,476
<i>but I was getting used to him.</i>

127
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,729
Father Banks, how are you?
Nice to see you!

128
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:38,315
How have you been?
Oh, give me your hat!

129
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,692
Say, uh, do you think
we could kinda do away

130
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,027
with that "Father Banks" stuff?

131
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:44,487
- Just call me Stanley.
- Okay, Stan.

132
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,615
Alright, not Stan.
Stanley.

133
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,866
- Stanley?
- Yeah.

134
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:49,159
Okay, Stanley.

135
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,410
How about little golf
on Sunday?

136
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,536
Ah, you're on.

137
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,497
Doris, it's wonderful
to see you again.

138
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:56,374
Well, Herbert boy, how are you?

139
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,459
Oh, so-so.

140
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,252
So-so?
Why, you look wonderful.

141
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,962
- Doris, how are you?
- How are you?

142
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,130
What's wrong with the old man?

143
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,174
It's the spring.
It always takes it out of him.

144
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:06,384
Takes it out? Puts it into me,
doesn't it, Ellie?

145
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,386
I suppose you got
the same message we did.

146
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,512
- Very important news.
- Yes, yes.

147
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:10,639
That's right.

148
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,807
- Kay, I can't wait.
- You have your cocktail.

149
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,851
Oh, darling,
you can't do this to us.

150
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,770
Buckley, you tell us.
We're all here now.

151
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,563
- Thank you, Buckley.
- Hope it's what I hope it is.

152
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,857
I know what it is.
Great news, eh, Buckley?

153
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,525
Well, I-I think it is.

154
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:25,487
Oh, Buckley did you tell them
and not tell us?

155
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,614
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I guessed it.

156
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:28,823
You really put it over,
didn't you, boy?

157
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,951
Oh, Buckley, he's not right.
It's not that horrid contract.

158
00:07:31,076 --> 00:07:32,410
A contract?
Is that what it is?

159
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,079
Thousands of dollars.

160
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:36,289
Oh, and we hoped it was a baby.

161
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,334
Oh, I prayed for a baby,
and now to hear this.

162
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,378
But, Mom, that's what it is.
It is a baby!

163
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,129
- A baby!
- What?! A baby?

164
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,757
Oh, Buckley, that's wonderful!

165
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:47,926
Oh-ho, congratulations!

166
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:50,136
<i>I'd never seen such excitement.</i>

167
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,055
<i>Kay was passed around
like a loving cup.</i>

168
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,723
I can't tell you
how delighted I am.

169
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,978
<i>Buckley stood by
trying to look modest.</i>

170
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,730
<i>He only succeeded in looking
slightly half-witted.</i>

171
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,236
<i>I grinned and tried to join in,</i>

172
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:09,030
<i>but somehow there was
a fly in the ointment.</i>

173
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,867
<i>I couldn't put my finger on it,
but there was definitely a fly.</i>

174
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:16,204
Yes, sir. That's the greatest
news I've had in years.

175
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,956
How about that, Grandpa?

176
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,544
<i>Grandpa!</i>

177
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,254
<i>That was the fly.</i>

178
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,298
<i>Grandpa.</i>

179
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,968
<i>First he steals my daughter.</i>

180
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,970
<i>Now he makes
a grandpa out of me.</i>

181
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:36,141
I do wish she'd go to Dr. Barns.

182
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:38,643
After all, he's taken care
of her all her life.

183
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,146
But I suppose this man
is alright, though.

184
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,773
Good gracious, November.
That doesn't give me much time.

185
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,775
And I have a million
things to do.

186
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,193
Ben? Tommy?

187
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,945
- What do you want them for?
- I want to tell 'em.

188
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,905
Ben? Tommy? Wake up.

189
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:54,284
Tommy, Ben.
Boys, do you hear me?

190
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:56,369
Something wrong?
What is it?

191
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,122
- What's the matter?
- The most exciting news.

192
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,790
Kay is having a baby.

193
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,084
Right now?

194
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,128
- No, silly, November.
- Poor Buckley.

195
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,546
"Poor Buckley?"
What do you mean, poor Buckley?

196
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:07,881
You wouldn't say that
if you'd been there tonight.

197
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:09,132
He was just bursting with pride.

198
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,842
We were standing there telling
him how delighted we were,

199
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,261
and he just stood there
looking sort of cute and shy.

200
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,013
Wasn't he cute, Stanley?

201
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,431
Cutest thing you ever saw.

202
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,266
Oh, alright, alright.
You're all alike, you men.

203
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,642
Good night, Tommy.
Sorry I woke you up.

204
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,519
Now night, Ben.
Go back to your book.

205
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,189
Good night, Ben.
Good night, Tommy.

206
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:28,651
Um, no need of broadcasting
this, you know.

207
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,494
Mrs. Dickson, please.

208
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:39,370
Ellie, what are you doing
calling people up

209
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,413
at this time of the night?

210
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,831
Will you please ask her
to call Mrs. Banks

211
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:42,832
the minute she comes in?

212
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,085
I have some very important
news to tell her.

213
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,628
Mrs. Dickson
would not forgive me

214
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,046
if I didn't tell her right away.

215
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,631
You know, I think
I'll give Kay a baby shower.

216
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:50,715
We could have it on a Saturday

217
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,966
and you could ask the men
to come in afterwards.

218
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,718
Ellie, do we really have to
blaze this thing

219
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,345
- from the housetops?
- Huh?

220
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,806
You know, after all,
it really isn't our affair.

221
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,224
Stanley, what's
the matter with you?

222
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,226
I swear you act as though
you almost didn't like the idea.

223
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,560
I don't!

224
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,729
Why, Stanley?
For heaven's sake, why?

225
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,815
I'll tell you why, exactly why.

226
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,691
In the first place, they haven't
got room enough for a baby.

227
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:09,859
The little apartment
they live in

228
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,112
isn't big enough for the two
of them, much less a baby.

229
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,738
Second place,
they can't afford a baby.

230
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,989
Babies cost money.

231
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,825
The older they get,
the more they cost.

232
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,284
What do they think
they're gonna use for money?

233
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,369
You heard him tonight,
didn't you?

234
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,954
When I asked him if he had
the contract, said no,

235
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,205
but did that faze him?

236
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,456
Oh, no, no.

237
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:25,333
He just stood there
looking cute.

238
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,545
Cute? And he's the one
who's going to be the father.

239
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,712
Well, I'll tell you something.

240
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:31,631
If he's got any idea
that I'm gonna pay for it,

241
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,715
he's got another thing coming.

242
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:34,717
I just got through
paying for the wedding.

243
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:36,636
And another thing --
I think they ought to wait.

244
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:37,887
Wait? For what?

245
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,639
For seven or eight years,
that's what.

246
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,723
What do they know
about children?

247
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:42,016
My Kay is just a child herself.

248
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,101
Here she gets out of college,

249
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:45,103
marries the first guy
she comes in contact with.

250
00:10:45,228 --> 00:10:46,479
Now she's saddled with a baby.

251
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,773
Stanley Banks, you listen to me.

252
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,984
I left school to marry you.
Do you remember that?

253
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,569
And do you remember
when we were married?

254
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:53,903
Of course you don't.

255
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,572
We were married
on the 4th of September.

256
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:56,865
What's that
got to do with it?

257
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,658
And do you remember
when Kay was born?

258
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,201
The 21st of June.

259
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,661
Exactly.

260
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,289
While my class was up there
on the platform graduating,

261
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:05,707
I was home having a baby.

262
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,375
Well, I don't...

263
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,629
Oh, Stanley, I-I-I know
they haven't money

264
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:14,132
and the apartment is small,

265
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,510
but those things don't
really matter, do they?

266
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,095
The important thing is that

267
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,055
we're going to have
a grandchild.

268
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,560
Darling, it's like
getting a dividend.

269
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,312
It's like getting a dividend?

270
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:30,815
Yeah, something comes to you and
you don't even lift a finger.

271
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,526
You have none of the
responsibilities of a baby,

272
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,153
none of the hardships.

273
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,488
All you have to do is love it.

274
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:44,621
Hello? Ruth? I have the most
marvelous news for you.

275
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:46,706
I am going to be a grandmother.

276
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:49,334
- "It's like getting a dividend."
- Yes! Isn't that divine?

277
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:50,627
Oh, we're so excited!

278
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:52,795
Yes, Kay told us about it
tonight.

279
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,258
<i>Ellie didn't seem
to mind the idea.</i>

280
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:01,095
<i>Maybe women were different, but
when I thought a grandfather...</i>

281
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,098
<i>Why, I was the guy
who was going places.</i>

282
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,934
<i>The whole world of adventure
was waiting,</i>

283
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,311
<i>just waiting for me
to give it the nod.</i>

284
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,438
<i>And now a grandfather.</i>

285
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,399
<i>I thought of the other
grandfathers I knew.</i>

286
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,693
<i>Why, they were old, old men.</i>

287
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,821
<i>The toothless old codger
down the street.</i>

288
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,531
<i>That client of ours
whose only fun</i>

289
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,116
<i>was cutting people
out of his will.</i>

290
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,954
<i>Those ancient dodos
at the club.</i>

291
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,497
<i>You'd have to use a stethoscope</i>

292
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:28,998
<i>to be sure
they were still living.</i>

293
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,460
<i>I didn't belong with them.</i>

294
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,212
<i>I wasn't ready
for the mothballs yet.</i>

295
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,547
<i>Why, I hadn't even
begun to live.</i>

296
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,636
<i>Only trouble with me was, I
was a little out of condition.</i>

297
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,554
<i>I spent the next afternoon
in the gym.</i>

298
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,876
Oh, that's fine.
Fine, thank you.

299
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,755
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

300
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,217
<i>That evening
I felt like a million.</i>

301
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,179
<i>But the next morning,
I felt closer to 100.</i>

302
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,147
Oh!

303
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,274
Oh.

304
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,527
Stanley, Buckley's here
for your golf match.

305
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,195
- Oh!
- What's the matter?

306
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,322
What have you done?

307
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:43,531
Oh, oh, oh, nothing.

308
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,074
Here, here, here,
let me help you.

309
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,118
- Oh, no, no.
- Where's the pain?

310
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:48,119
It's -- It's all over.

311
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,912
Oh, whatever did you do?
What happened?

312
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,706
I'll call Dr. Barns and get him
over here right away.

313
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,333
No, I don't want any doctor.

314
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,209
Stanley, for all we know,
it might be your appendix.

315
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,544
If -- How could --

316
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,671
I haven't got an appendix,
and you know it.

317
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,798
- Well, I'll get Buckley.
- Buckley?

318
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,551
If I don't want a doctor,
I certainly don't want Buckley.

319
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,970
Well, I thought
he might be able to help.

320
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,264
Help? Don't you think
he's done enough?

321
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,100
All I want is a hot bath
with some Epsom salts.

322
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,935
Alright, I'll tell Buckley
and be right back.

323
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,187
Oh, Buckley!

324
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,397
Buckley. Oh, oh, oh.

325
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:23,988
<i>The next week Ellie gave what
she called a "stork shower."</i>

326
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,074
<i>This is one form
of highway robbery</i>

327
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,617
<i>not punishable by law.</i>

328
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,417
Kay! Kay, here's one here
you haven't opened.

329
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,419
Delilah, be sure
to keep all the cards.

330
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,587
Yes, Miss Banks.

331
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,130
Stanley?

332
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,258
Stanley, how wonderful
that you got home in time.

333
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:46,094
You should see
the things they gave Kay.

334
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,180
Everyone was so sweet.
They all brought her something.

335
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,723
What else could they do, honey?

336
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,767
Oh, Stanley,
you make it sound so sordid.

337
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,352
- Go on in. Kay's in there.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

338
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,645
That's no place for a man.

339
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,564
Hi, Pops!
Where you going?

340
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,316
Don't you wanna come in
and see my plunder?

341
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,776
- Well, I-I'll see it later.
- Oh, come on.

342
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,778
Stanley, when you're finished,
I have something very important

343
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,904
I wanna talk over with you.

344
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,030
- I'll be in the kitchen.
- Alright.

345
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,031
You just got to see.

346
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,699
The cutest things
I've ever seen.

347
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:21,462
Well, fine.
Now, I have to go now.

348
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,047
Oh, no, no, go over
and talk to Buckley.

349
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,507
He's just all by himself
over there.

350
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,719
<i>Buckley looked like
a man going down</i>

351
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,347
<i>for the third and last time.</i>

352
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,808
<i>But I decided to let him
stew in his own juice.</i>

353
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,184
I have to talk to Ellie.

354
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,108
Well, what do you want, Ma?

355
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,444
Alright.

356
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,740
I, uh, wanted to talk to you
before the Dunstans got here.

357
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,200
You know how worried I've been

358
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,369
about how we're gonna
rattle around in this house

359
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:56,164
after Ben leaves
for school in the fall.

360
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,165
Mm-hmm.

361
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,125
Well, I had
a wonderful idea today.

362
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,835
Uh-huh.

363
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,922
I say we ask Kay and Buckley
to move in with us.

364
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,466
Ellie, are you crazy?

365
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,594
Stanley, it'd be so simple.

366
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:13,014
We could make a sitting room for
them out of Kay's old bedroom

367
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,641
and knock through a door
to Ben's room,

368
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,477
and that could be their bedroom.

369
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:20,229
Then if we put Tommy
in the spare room,

370
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,815
we could put connecting doors
from the bathroom,

371
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,152
and that would be the nursery
right next to our room.

372
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:27,820
We could even knock through
a door to our room

373
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:28,905
so if the baby cr--

374
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,907
Yes, that will be
getting nowhere, Ellie.

375
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:31,782
No.

376
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,701
Stanley, it won't cost much.

377
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,870
I had the contractor
over here today.

378
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,747
It's a perfect place
for the baby,

379
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:39,582
and the wonderful thing
would be that

380
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,250
if they wanted to go out
some evening

381
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,793
or even go away
for a week or two,

382
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:43,836
they wouldn't have to worry.

383
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,671
We'd be right here
to take care of it.

384
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,714
Now, look, Ellie.

385
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,591
I know how anxious you've been

386
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,510
to get your hooks
into that baby.

387
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:51,761
But the answer is no.

388
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,054
I've been all
through that, you know.

389
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:55,556
The 2:00 feedings
and the colic and the measles

390
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,767
and all the rest of it, and I'm
not going through it again,

391
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,727
especially with
somebody else's baby.

392
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,479
But it wouldn't be
like that, Stanley.

393
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:02,980
It would be fun
to have a baby here.

394
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,066
Yeah, you can go over and see
the baby at their apartment

395
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,734
when they get it all
washed and ironed,

396
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,819
but it's not coming here,
and that's final.

397
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,404
Well, you know that apartment
isn't big enough.

398
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,781
Alright, tell them
to buy a house.

399
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,157
They can't afford a house.

400
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,951
They should have thought
of that before.

401
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,454
I don't understand
how you can be so hard

402
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,207
on a poor innocent little baby.

403
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,627
Mom, Pops,
the Dunstans are here.

404
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,878
Would you please come out
and talk to them?

405
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,547
I gotta say goodbye
to the girls.

406
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,006
Of course.

407
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,510
Come on, Stanley.

408
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,518
Doris, Herbert, we were afraid
you weren't coming.

409
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:42,520
Well, well, Ellie.

410
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:43,854
Hello, Doris.

411
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,440
And how's Grandpa Banks?

412
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:47,775
Why? What's the matter?

413
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,777
Well, I'm a little stiff.
I've been taking some exercise.

414
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,445
Exercise?
Well, you're crazy.

415
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:52,780
Look at me, fit as fiddle.

416
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,532
I always say
the only exercise I get

417
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,367
is burying the men that take it.

418
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,036
Really, this baby's
the best thing

419
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,413
that ever happened to Herbert.

420
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,123
It's given him
a new lease on life.

421
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,750
- Sit down. I'll have Delilah --
- Oh, no, no, no, not now.

422
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,753
You sit down, Ellie.
You sit down.

423
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,213
Ooh, I beg your pardon, dear,

424
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,465
because I've got
something I wanna show you.

425
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:12,842
Kay, Buckley, come here.

426
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,302
I want you to see your present.

427
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,137
Here, take this out
of the way, will you, Stan?

428
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:17,513
Now, we're gonna
need lot of room.

429
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,764
Here you are, old boy.

430
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,642
- What is it?
- It's a blueprint!

431
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,436
Here, hand me that chair.

432
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,563
A blueprint for the future.

433
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:27,607
A blueprint for happiness.

434
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:29,984
Here now, Stan, just hold
that side down, will you?

435
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,069
And you hold
the other side, Ellie.

436
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,447
There now, you two kids,
take a look at that.

437
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:35,615
What is it?

438
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,242
- It's your new home.
- Home?

439
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,161
- What do you mean?
- Well, I'll tell you.

440
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,246
I was looking over our house
just the other day.

441
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:44,332
And it came to me
like an inspiration.

442
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:47,877
That whole west wing, it was
the perfect place for you kids.

443
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,630
So I called up my architect
and I had him come right out.

444
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,173
Here, let me show you.

445
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,635
Your own study, your own
living room, dining alcove,

446
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,720
kitchen and laundry,

447
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,765
and over here,
baby's room, nurse's room,

448
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,850
and master bedroom.

449
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,977
And it's all plenty commodious.

450
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,520
<i>Ellie was fit to be tied.</i>

451
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,023
<i>She saw that baby
slipping out of her hands.</i>

452
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,401
The living room is 26x22.
Is that big enough?

453
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,863
And best of all, you'll have
two babysitters ready made.

454
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,657
That's right.

455
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:19,659
Well, kids, how about it?

456
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:22,328
Why, it's wonderful,
isn't it, Buckley?

457
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:24,455
Yeah, yeah. Gee, Dad,
that's swell of you.

458
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,456
I'll get that tea now.

459
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,540
Now you understand, of course,

460
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,834
that there's nothing final
about these particular plans.

461
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,544
I just thought I'd give you
a general idea

462
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:31,962
of what it might look like.

463
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:34,256
Now, if you'd like
to have your entrance here,

464
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:35,591
well that can be managed.

465
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:36,717
I'll call up the architect...

466
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,177
- What's the matter, Ellie?
- It's all your fault.

467
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,804
It never would --
would have happened

468
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,806
if you'd let me ask them here.

469
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:42,973
Ellie, I don't get it.

470
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,558
You're more excited
about this baby

471
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:45,768
than you were about any of ours.

472
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,228
Well, you don't understand.

473
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,063
This is the time
that Kay needs me the most.

474
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,399
I was -- I was gonna take
so much off her shoulders.

475
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,401
I was gonna help her
with the shopping

476
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,612
and help fix the baby clothes
and fix the nursery.

477
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,740
Alright, alright, Ellie, if
it means so much, have it here.

478
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,242
- I don't care.
- Oh, it's too late now.

479
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:03,244
They're going to the Dunstans'.
We'll never see them.

480
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,288
Oh, Ellie, don't be silly now.

481
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:09,208
You heard what
Doris Dunstan said.

482
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,751
This baby was the best thing
in the world

483
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,586
that ever happened to Herbert.

484
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,422
To Herbert!

485
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,341
They're gonna take over
that baby body and soul.

486
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,301
- Ellie, this is ridiculous.
- Don't talk to me.

487
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:20,845
You're acting like --

488
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:28,686
It was so sweet of you.

489
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,062
So wonderful.

490
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,981
And we'll never be able
to thank you enough,

491
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:34,191
but i-it's really better
this way.

492
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:37,111
We'd -- We'd only have gotten
in your way.

493
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,739
I'm sorry you went to all
this trouble and expense, Dad.

494
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,198
We should have told you sooner.

495
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,825
Have you already bought it?

496
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,870
Well, practically.
We made a deposit on Sunday.

497
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:47,538
- I see.
- What's this, Kay?

498
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,081
You got a house?

499
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,625
I didn't realize that you
were in a position to buy.

500
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,879
Well, yeah, we got
a mortgage from the bank.

501
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:56,297
A mortgage?!

502
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:57,423
What's wrong with a mortgage?

503
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,258
I had a mortgage myself
until a few years ago.

504
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,593
Tell me all about
the house, Kay.

505
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:02,470
- Where is it?
- It's in the new development.

506
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,221
It's just darling,
isn't it, Buckley?

507
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,223
It's just big enough for me
to take care of easily,

508
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,933
and there's a nice backyard
for the baby,

509
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,727
and Bob and Bliss
are gonna buy out there.

510
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,937
- Is it furnished?
- Well, uh, no, it isn't.

511
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,898
But we thought we could buy
some unpainted furniture.

512
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:16,817
Oh, you can't lift a finger.
You don't have to do a thing.

513
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,278
I'll do the whole business.
What's a mother for?

514
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,488
I'd like to know.

515
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,239
<i>Ellie was off again.</i>

516
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:27,787
<i>For the next few weeks,</i>

517
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,622
<i>I'd stop at the new house
to pick up Ellie.</i>

518
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,874
<i>She was working time
and overtime.</i>

519
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,426
Hi, Pops.

520
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,094
Hi, kitten.

521
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,765
Well, how are ya?

522
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,518
Wonderful. Come on in
and see what we're doing.

523
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:57,066
Oh, no, you don't.
You stay out in the air.

524
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,276
- I'm alright now.
- What's the matter?

525
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,528
Oh, it was just
the smell of the paint.

526
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:01,779
Well, it still smells.

527
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,823
Stanley, make her stay out here
while Buckley comes to get her.

528
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,282
He ought to be here any minute.

529
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,826
Let's sit in the shade.

530
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,161
I feel so guilty.
Mom's doing so much.

531
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,039
Oh, nonsense. You know that's
the breath of life for her.

532
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,499
Where do we sit?

533
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:14,959
How about over here?

534
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,794
There?

535
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,295
How do you like the house, Pops?

536
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,631
- Oh, I think it's just right.
- Doris just loved it.

537
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,757
They said they never
would have moved

538
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,467
if it hadn't gotten
too small for them.

539
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,885
Hmm.

540
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,680
Oh, that must be little Bobby's.
I'll send it to him.

541
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:34,520
Pops, how did you feel
when you had your first baby?

542
00:22:34,645 --> 00:22:37,231
Did it make any difference
between you and Moms?

543
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:40,067
I-I mean how did you feel?

544
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,485
Well, I felt fine.

545
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,070
I mean, really?

546
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,573
Well, I felt alright.

547
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:48,075
Well, I guess my nose was
a little out of joint at first.

548
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,077
I'd been high man with
your mother for over a year,

549
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,246
and then suddenly you came along
and took the spotlight.

550
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,622
You must have hated me.

551
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,208
No, no, I don't think
it was that bad.

552
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,794
I think the worst time
was the first night

553
00:22:58,919 --> 00:22:59,962
we took you home, you know.

554
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,673
Yeah, I remember
we got you home,

555
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,801
gave you your 6:00 feeding,
got you bedded down.

556
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,720
Then we must have gone
to your room a dozen times

557
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:09,597
the next hour
to see how you were.

558
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,765
Of course, if you were quiet, we
went in to see if you were dead.

559
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:14,393
And if you cried, we went in
to see what was wrong with you.

560
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,313
I remember lying awake
that night thinking to myself,

561
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:18,397
"Now, what have we got into?

562
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,941
Here we were,
two perfectly happy people,

563
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,568
free as the air.

564
00:23:22,693 --> 00:23:24,653
Now we're trapped.

565
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:27,573
Trapped by 20 inches
of screaming humanity."

566
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,408
Do all fathers feel that way?

567
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,493
I only know about myself.

568
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:34,747
I remember that morning
you -- you woke with the dawn...

569
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,666
...screaming your head off.

570
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,627
And your mother went in
to heat your formula,

571
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,546
and I went in to see what
I could do about quieting you.

572
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:47,009
And I stuck a finger at you,
and you grabbed it.

573
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,219
Grabbed it with such a grip.

574
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,599
From that moment on,
you had me hooked.

575
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:55,643
Oh, I hope Buckley
gets over there quickly.

576
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:57,436
You have to butter him up
a little, you know.

577
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,271
Make him think he's still
part of the family.

578
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,106
Thanks, Pops.

579
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,608
Oh, there he is.

580
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,193
Hi, honey.

581
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:07,905
- Hi, honey.
- How are you, darling? Ahh!

582
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,491
- Oh, hello, there! How are ya?
- Fine, thank you.

583
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:13,077
Well, what new wonders
did we accomplish today?

584
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:14,536
You're gonna see it tomorrow.
Take her along now.

585
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,497
- You'll be late for the party.
- Mom, Buckley can help.

586
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,332
There's nothing left to do.
Your father and I will lock up.

587
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,959
- Have fun.
- Well, okay.

588
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,461
- Goodbye. Goodbye, Stanley.
- Where you going?

589
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,755
Stan, come here.
I want to show you.

590
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,590
How do you like this green?

591
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,925
Isn't it a perfectly
wonderful shade?

592
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,301
- We're gonna use it in here.
- Fine.

593
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,469
And in the hall and every place.

594
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,679
It'll make the house
look much larger.

595
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:33,180
And the same thing
with the curtain.

596
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,807
I got the most wonderful
bargain today.

597
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,725
A Millen, look at that.

598
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,520
For all the windows.
And this is for the bedroom.

599
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,562
Just wait till you see
the price.

600
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:41,730
You'll be very proud of me.

601
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,190
I'm staying right
within their budget.

602
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,275
I'm having a marvelous time.

603
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,403
There's only one thing wrong.

604
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:50,572
I haven't done a thing
about the nursery.

605
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:52,074
I could cry about it.

606
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,283
What's the matter?

607
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,828
- Herbert's doing it.
- Dunstan?

608
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,663
He was so upset about
their not moving in with him.

609
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:58,747
He said the least they could do

610
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,040
would be to let him
furnish the nursery.

611
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:02,126
He's going to give them
a crib and a bassinet

612
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,627
and a screen
and a chest of drawers.

613
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,797
It'll probably all be done
in 14-karat gold.

614
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:10,175
What are we gonna give the baby?

615
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,719
Stan!

616
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,220
What are you so surprised about?

617
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,763
Didn't you think I was gonna
give the baby a present?

618
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,265
Well, as a matter of fact,
there was something

619
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,475
I was looking at today that
would make a wonderful present.

620
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,519
You put it right in this window,
and it keeps the air clean

621
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,770
and the right temperature.

622
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,522
It's very pretty
and modern-looking.

623
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,607
- It's quite expensive.
- What's the name of it?

624
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,860
I don't know the name of it, but
it will only extend this far.

625
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:30,696
- Where did you see it?
- Downtown.

626
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:32,990
You see, uh,
you regulate it from here.

627
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,784
It controls the air and the
temperature at all times, see.

628
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,370
No dust, no soot, no pollen.

629
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,164
- Hmm.
- Wonderful. Ellie's idea.

630
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:41,248
Wish we'd had one for Tommy.

631
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:43,208
He probably wouldn't
have those adenoids.

632
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,127
It is wonderful.
And look over here.

633
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,754
Come here.
I want to show you this.

634
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:47,963
Now, you see?

635
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:51,383
You turn it on and leave it here
beside his crib.

636
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,218
And then you can go out
and close the door.

637
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:54,261
And if he cries

638
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,555
or even if there's any change
in his breathing,

639
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,140
you can hear it
from anywhere in the house.

640
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,100
No. Hmm, well, they're
certainly gonna love that.

641
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:03,062
And here's his combination
bath and dressing table.

642
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:04,646
Right, just the right size.

643
00:26:04,772 --> 00:26:06,065
What is that?
What is that?

644
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:08,192
Oh, that's mine. I thought he
might as well get used to it.

645
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:09,359
He'll going there someday.

646
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:10,736
- Oh, he will?
- Oh, yes.

647
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,613
As a matter of fact,
I've already registered him

648
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:14,198
in the class of 1973.

649
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,366
Mm.
I'm a Dartmouth man myself.

650
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:17,910
Oh, that's a good college, too.

651
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:20,037
Now, this bath, Stan, I want you
to notice the height of it.

652
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:21,705
A good college?

653
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,208
A good college?

654
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:31,131
We beat you in football in 1947,
1948, and 1949.

655
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,591
And we shall probably --

656
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:36,011
And we have defeated you
five years running in hockey.

657
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,514
And our bobsled team
is probably the finest

658
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:40,390
that has ever been developed
in the history of the world.

659
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,309
Ellie's make some fresh coffee.

660
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,685
A good --

661
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:45,646
That's one of the funniest
remarks you've ever made.

662
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,732
Now, now, wait a minute.
No, no, now listen here, Stan.

663
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:50,943
And, you know, scholastically...

664
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:53,821
Well, what do you think
of our little nursery?

665
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:55,614
- Isn't it lovely?
- Fine, fine.

666
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,617
The wonderful thing is, most
of it can grow up with him.

667
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,119
The shelves, for instance.

668
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:01,954
It'll hold his toys now,

669
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,498
but later he can use it
for his tennis racket.

670
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,791
<i>Ellie was right.</i>

671
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,627
<i>They had taken over the baby
lock, stock, and barrel.</i>

672
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,671
- ...and things.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

673
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,923
Oh, thank you, dear.

674
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,466
Isn't that a beautiful
record, Pops?

675
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:15,759
Mm-hmm.

676
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,137
Mother Dunstan gave it to me.
She gave me the whole album.

677
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:20,722
I remember that I used to
listen to classical music

678
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,558
while I was waiting for Buckley.

679
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:25,352
I think that's why
he whistles so well.

680
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,062
Have you ever heard him whistle?

681
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:29,773
No, no, I haven't.

682
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,567
Well, you should
ask him sometime.

683
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,694
Yes, I will.
I certainly will.

684
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,237
By the way, son,
what are you going to call

685
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,071
this baby of yours?

686
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,447
We've had some terrible
arguments about it.

687
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:38,448
Haven't we, Buckley?

688
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,242
We've gone through
all the telephone books,

689
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,035
the dictionaries,
the baby books.

690
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,788
Finally, we found a couple
of names we both liked.

691
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,040
Come on, sit down here.
Sit down.

692
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,710
Uh, if it's a boy, we thought
we might call him Andrew.

693
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,128
Andrew? Who's Andrew?

694
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:54,673
Well, there's a Andrew Jackson
and Andrew Nordell, my doctor.

695
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,842
And besides, we like
the name Andrew.

696
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:59,511
And -- And we both like
the name Jonathan.

697
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,347
Oh, no, not Jonathan.
Better call him plain John.

698
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:05,350
Well, we also thought
we might call him Michael.

699
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,351
That's a good name.

700
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,686
Oh, you can't call him Michael.

701
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:10,689
I went to school with a Michael,
and he smelled.

702
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,066
Well, now, Ellie, just because
your Michael smelled,

703
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:16,570
you know, it doesn't mean that
all Michaels have to smell.

704
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:18,071
You know a name that I've loved

705
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,699
ever since I first read
"Little Women"?

706
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,452
Lauren, Laurie.
Remember how dear he was?

707
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,329
How about Timothy?
I think that has everything.

708
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:26,997
Do you like the name
of Timothy, Kay?

709
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:27,915
Well, I --

710
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,541
Now, Ellie,
they've already told you

711
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,627
they've been all through this.

712
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:34,129
Why do we suggest
any more names?

713
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,381
Besides, the names
they have are wonderful.

714
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:39,551
Jonathan, Michael, Andrew,
they're all wonderful names.

715
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,888
But you have to think
of two names that go together.

716
00:28:43,013 --> 00:28:47,059
Andrew Dunstan, that doesn't
sound very good, does it?

717
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:48,810
Stanley, they haven't
made up their minds.

718
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:49,937
They need our help.

719
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,188
If I may interrupt, I think

720
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:52,940
you're going about this
all wrong.

721
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:55,150
My idea would be
to use a family name.

722
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,401
Well, that's right.

723
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,529
The first grandson is always
supposed to have the name

724
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:01,240
of the paternal grandfather,
isn't it?

725
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:03,909
No, no, no. Now, Doris,
that's not what I meant.

726
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:06,245
I was thinking of
my great-grandfather Malcolm

727
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,205
or, we", say Uncle Wilfred.

728
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,082
Well, if we're talking
about family names,

729
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,416
what about Stanley?

730
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,169
Stanley Dunstan, that ought
to satisfy everybody.

731
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,129
Well, we did think about that.

732
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:17,798
No, no, no, no.

733
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:21,134
No, one Stanley
in the family is enough.

734
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,803
You're right.
Now, how about Cornelius?

735
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,763
That's a family name.
And then let's see.

736
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,808
There's Gregory and Dexter
and David.

737
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:30,852
I had some wonderful names
in my family, too.

738
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:32,854
Milo and Fennington.

739
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,149
Fennington, now, that's nice.
That'd be a nice name.

740
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,943
Fennington.

741
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:39,736
We're all talking
about boys' names.

742
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:40,737
What if it's a girl?

743
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,155
We've got to decide
on a girl's name.

744
00:29:42,281 --> 00:29:43,949
Oh, it won't be a girl.
Don't worry.

745
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:45,450
The Dunstans always run to boys.

746
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,452
I'm not worried.
I want it to be a girl.

747
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,037
I like girls.

748
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,539
Where are you going, darling?

749
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:52,082
I thought I'd wash the dishes.

750
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,625
Oh, nothing of the sort.
I'll do them.

751
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,127
Mom, please let me go.

752
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:57,838
You do too much, Kay.
You must rest more.

753
00:29:57,963 --> 00:29:58,964
Oh, I don't agree with you.

754
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:00,257
I think some work
is good for you.

755
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,134
I think she should have a maid.
I'd be perfectly willing --

756
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,511
Of course, I don't mean
she should work if she's tired.

757
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,138
It's this young doctor of hers.

758
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:08,724
I've always said she should
have gone to our family doctor.

759
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:10,225
We wanted her to go
to our doctor, too.

760
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,019
There's nothing the matter
with my doctor.

761
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:13,854
He's fine.
He's wonderful.

762
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,064
He told me not to pay
any attention to --

763
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:18,775
N-Nobody seems to realize
this is my baby.

764
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,527
Mine and Buckley's.

765
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,238
You seem to think
with the way you talk --

766
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,531
Well -- Well,
I'll have you know this.

767
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,992
I'm going to have my baby
the way I want to.

768
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:45,344
Well, now that we've succeeded
in reducing her to hysterics,

769
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:47,012
what do you say we get out
of here and go home?

770
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:48,513
Oh, she's just high-strung.

771
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:49,890
- Where are your things?
- In the bedroom.

772
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,683
I'll get them.

773
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,143
Come here.

774
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,402
Oh, thanks.

775
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,403
Pops.

776
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,030
Uh, we're going to
run along, kitten.

777
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,032
Please come in, Pops.

778
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:09,159
Go ahead.
I'll take their things.

779
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,790
- Aww.
- Oh, Pops, that was horrible.

780
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:17,501
I was terrible.
They'll never forgive me.

781
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:21,421
No, no, we -- we deserve
much worse than that.

782
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,881
It wasn't you.

783
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:25,884
You never interfere, but --
but the others.

784
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:29,179
Mother and Father Dunstan
and Moms.

785
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,348
I'm doing too much.
I'm doing too little.

786
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,725
She wants a girl.
They want a boy.

787
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,060
No matter what the baby is,

788
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:36,561
somebody's going to be
disappointed.

789
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,648
Yeah, I think what you'll have
to do is have, you know, twins,

790
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:40,816
one of each sex.

791
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:43,985
Thank heavens for you, Pops.

792
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:45,487
You're the only one
with any sense.

793
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,531
Oh, no, no, I'm just as bad
as the rest of them.

794
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:48,532
But I'll tell you this.

795
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:49,908
There's going to be
no more of it.

796
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:50,992
It'll never happen again.

797
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,744
We'll never gang up
on you again.

798
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,079
Believe me.

799
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,747
- Thanks, Pops.
- You relax, kitten.

800
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,707
From now on,
it's going to be your way.

801
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,501
A-And you won't let them
make a fuss

802
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,753
with Dr. Nordell, will you?

803
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:02,838
What do you mean, dear?

804
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,589
Well, the Dunstans said
they were going down

805
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,133
to have a talk with him.

806
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,926
Oh, Pops, you won't
let them do that, will you?

807
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,428
Oh, of course I won't.

808
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,263
What nonsense.
He's your doctor.

809
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:13,432
You have confidence in him,
faith in him.

810
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,892
No one has a right
to destroy that confidence.

811
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,811
Thanks, Pops.

812
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,438
It -- It isn't their fault,
really.

813
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:22,274
It's just that, well, I guess
they just don't understand

814
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,151
the new way of looking
at things.

815
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,820
Well, after all,
as Dr. Nordell says,

816
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,614
birth is a perfectly
natural thing,

817
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,408
a-a-a glorious thing

818
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:33,368
and want to be
conscious every minute

819
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,495
so -- so they don't miss
a second of it.

820
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,664
He believes that a woman
should be aware

821
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,791
of the wonderful thing
that's happening to her.

822
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,293
And another thing.

823
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:43,170
He doesn't believe that
a woman should be separated

824
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:45,547
from her baby for one second
after it's born.

825
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:49,426
You -- You should carry it
with you right back to your room

826
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,595
and -- and keep it there
with you,

827
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,681
sleeping right there with you
in your hospital room.

828
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,808
That is a little new, isn't it?

829
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,977
Oh, Pops, that's not new.

830
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,896
Primitive woman
has always done it.

831
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:02,564
Dr. Nordell was in the Pacific,

832
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,357
and he said the women there,
why --

833
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,776
why, they were never
separated from their babies.

834
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:08,487
They -- They kept them slung
on their backs

835
00:33:08,612 --> 00:33:10,405
for the first two years
of their lives.

836
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,699
And he said it was wonderful
for the babies.

837
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:16,244
He said if he had his way, all
of his mothers would do that.

838
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,663
You'd -- You'd carry them
on your back

839
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,040
while you were doing
your housework,

840
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,751
and then when it got hungry,
you'd swing it around

841
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:25,670
and feed it and then
swing it back again.

842
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:29,132
He says it gives the baby a
wonderful feeling of security.

843
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:33,470
Hmm, uh, darling,
you're -- you're, you know --

844
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,055
you're sure that this doctor --

845
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,349
Oh, Pops, you're not
going to start that, too?

846
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:40,352
No, no.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

847
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,312
Dr. Nordell is wonderful.

848
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,272
- He's marvelous. He's --
- Yeah.

849
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,441
Well, he's simply
terribly wonderful.

850
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,109
Darling, I'm sure he is.

851
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:50,028
I'm sure he is.

852
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,821
- Kitten, I'm sure.
- Thank you, Pops.

853
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:54,866
Now, you -- you just go to sleep
and relax.

854
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,910
Okay.
Good night, Pops.

855
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,120
- Good night, darling.
- Good night.

856
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,387
Dr. Nordell will be
with you in a minute.

857
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:17,264
- Please be seated.
- Thank you.

858
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,728
I just don't like the idea.

859
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,897
I thought we said last night,
the Dunstans and all of us,

860
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,357
that we weren't going to
interfere any more

861
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,234
in their affairs.

862
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:30,860
I'm not going to have
my daughter walking around

863
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:32,988
for two years
with her papoose on her back.

864
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:34,531
Darling, I tell you,
that's figurative.

865
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:35,824
He didn't mean that literally.

866
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,617
Hmm, just want to be sure.

867
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,126
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

868
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,753
- Good morning,
-I am so glad you came.

869
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,463
Now I've met the whole family.

870
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,799
Mr. and Mrs. Dunstan Sr.
were in this morning.

871
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,801
- Oh, they were?
- They were a little anxious.

872
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,303
Thought Kay was doing too much.

873
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:59,139
But I think I convinced them
that she was alright.

874
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,890
That's a wonderful
daughter you have.

875
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:03,268
- Thank you.
- Oh, excuse me.

876
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,395
- Won't you, Mrs. Banks?
- Thank you.

877
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:11,693
So, what can I do for you?

878
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,320
Well, as a matter of fact,

879
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,155
my wife has been
a little worried, too.

880
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,907
And you know how mothers are
at this time.

881
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,326
Only daughter
and all that sort of thing.

882
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:22,162
I thought the best thing to do
would be to bring her down here

883
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,330
and let her have
a talk with you.

884
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,957
I think that's very sensible.

885
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,126
What particularly
worries you, Mrs. Banks?

886
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,461
Well, actually, I --

887
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,339
Well, actually, it's
the whole thing, isn't it?

888
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:36,343
Uh, I mean, about it all being
so natural and everything.

889
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:38,470
I'm just trying to take away

890
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:39,929
any fear she might have.

891
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:44,184
You know, the fear of pain
can really produce pain.

892
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:47,729
But if she understands
the whole process,

893
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:49,314
if she has confidence in me,

894
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:51,149
if she knows that I'm going to
be right there with her

895
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,817
to help her when she wants help,

896
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:56,613
if she trusts me, that's
half the battle, isn't it?

897
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,114
Yes, it is.

898
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,534
And then afterward, having
the baby in the room with her,

899
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,078
I'm trying
to persuade my mothers

900
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:05,830
to go back to caring
for their babies themselves,

901
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:08,541
feeding them themselves,
bathing them,

902
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,085
being close to them

903
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,379
instead of handing them
over to some nurse.

904
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,422
I know that this is a lot
to ask of your daughter.

905
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:16,591
It's -- It's a full-time job.

906
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:19,969
But believe me,
the rewards will be great

907
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:22,514
not only for the baby,
but for Kay.

908
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:23,598
There you are, Ellie.

909
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,975
I told you, all of your worry
for nothing.

910
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,727
It's a --
Thank you, Doctor.

911
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,979
You were nice to give her
so much of your time.

912
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,439
It's to my advantage.

913
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,066
If I have you with me,
then, believe me,

914
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,484
everything's going to be
that much easier.

915
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,069
Well, you certainly
have us with you.

916
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,029
Thank you very much, Doctor.

917
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,115
- You can count on that.
- Very happy to have seen you.

918
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,950
Come on now, Ellie, dear.
The doctor's busy.

919
00:36:42,075 --> 00:36:43,076
Good bye.

920
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,912
<i>For the next month or two,
everything was peaceful.</i>

921
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,163
<i>Too peaceful.</i>

922
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:50,166
<i>I should have known it was
the calm before a storm.</i>

923
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,757
Ellie, answer --
Telephone, Ellie.

924
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:06,141
Hello?

925
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:08,852
Hello -- Buckley?

926
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:10,395
What?

927
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,313
Buckley, you know
what time it is?

928
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:13,565
It's a quarter of 3:00.

929
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,735
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize.

930
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:18,611
Is Kay there?

931
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:19,779
Kay?

932
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,240
Why, of course she isn't here.

933
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,783
What would she --

934
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,202
Hello! Hello?

935
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,415
Buckley, I'll --
I'll take this downstairs.

936
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,875
Hang on.

937
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:53,605
Hello.

938
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:56,441
Now, what do you mean,
is she here?

939
00:37:56,566 --> 00:37:59,611
I thought if she were there,
I could come and pick her up,

940
00:37:59,736 --> 00:38:00,945
if she were there.

941
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,865
When did she leave?
What time did she leave?

942
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,117
I don't know.
I-I've been out for a few hours.

943
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:07,786
I just got back
a little while ago.

944
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,288
What was it?
A fight?

945
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,041
Did you have a fight?

946
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:16,586
Well, we had an argument, yes.

947
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,214
Look, if anything happens
to her, I'll kill myself.

948
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:21,549
Don't worry.
I'll do it for you.

949
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,468
Did you look --
Did she take anything with her?

950
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:24,469
A bag or anything?

951
00:38:24,594 --> 00:38:26,846
She took her hat box
and her umbrella

952
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,224
and her toilet case
and her toothbrush.

953
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:31,434
Oh, we", don't worry
about it, then.

954
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,895
If she took a toothbrush,
she's not headed for the river.

955
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,649
Uh, did you call up and try
anybody else on the phone?

956
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:39,108
Well, you might do that.

957
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:40,819
Alright, I'll be right over.

958
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,499
- Any word?
- No.

959
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:57,168
- Did you call her friends?
- Everyone I could think of.

960
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,838
The hotels,
and I can't wait any longer.

961
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:01,714
- I'm going to call the police.
- No, no, no, wait a minute.

962
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,757
No, don't do that yet.

963
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,425
Maybe we can
figure this thing out.

964
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:06,678
- Uh, did she take the car?
- No.

965
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:08,888
Is there a bus runs by
at this hour?

966
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,557
Anybody you could think of
might have picked her up?

967
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,559
- I've covered the field.
- Well, then it must be a cab.

968
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:15,353
- What's the number?
- Fairview 6 --

969
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,188
Fairview 6-1-0-9-8.

970
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,439
But there's no use asking them.

971
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:20,108
They told me they don't
give out that information

972
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:21,192
except to the police.

973
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:22,485
Fairview 6-1-0-9-8.

974
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,237
They said they had to
make it a blanket rule.

975
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,656
There are too many wives wanting
to leave their husbands.

976
00:39:27,991 --> 00:39:30,201
- She have much cash?
- I don't believe so.

977
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,537
I give her money,
but she keeps losing it.

978
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,707
Is this the first time
she's left you?

979
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:36,749
What do you mean by that?

980
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:39,294
Oh, come, come, come, my boy.
I'm married, too.

981
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:41,629
Now, has she ever done
anything like this before?

982
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:45,758
No. No, she locked me out
a few times, but that's all.

983
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:48,469
Hello.
Hello, the Green Cab Company?

984
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:50,638
I know this is
against your rules,

985
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,307
but I-I certainly
would appreciate it

986
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:53,850
if you could help me out.

987
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:57,478
Uh, did you get a call last
night from 324 Adam Street?

988
00:39:57,604 --> 00:40:00,231
Look, I told you once,
it's against rules.

989
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:04,319
Well, I'm not her husband,
you see, I'm her father.

990
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:06,029
And, uh, she's --

991
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:08,239
Well, she's, uh --

992
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,825
She's expecting, uh, you know,

993
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:13,703
and you know how they are
in that condition.

994
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,747
Sometimes they do --

995
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,540
If you could find it
in your heart to help me,

996
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:18,791
I certainly would appreciate it.

997
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:21,294
Well...

998
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:24,839
...there was a call.

999
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,341
Where did you take her?

1000
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,136
Thanks, thanks very, very much.

1001
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,638
We won't forget this.

1002
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:32,639
Where'd she go?

1003
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,557
- Home.
- Home?

1004
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,517
Home? What do you mean, home?
This is her home.

1005
00:40:36,643 --> 00:40:39,103
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I mean my home. Come on.

1006
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,939
I'll wait here.

1007
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:43,816
Do you want her to come back
or don't you?

1008
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:45,068
Yes.

1009
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,153
Well, then you'll have to
go and get her.

1010
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,738
That's the first law
of marriage.

1011
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,157
You can't expect
any self-respecting wife

1012
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,576
to come home
under her own power.

1013
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:07,840
I don't suppose you want to tell
me what the quarrel was about?

1014
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,301
If you don't mind,
I'd rather not talk about it.

1015
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:11,552
Okay.

1016
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,473
I don't know whether
you know it,

1017
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,101
but your daughter's
got a terrible temper.

1018
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:19,477
I'm sorry.

1019
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,146
And this business tonight,
why, it's like a child,

1020
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:23,648
and a spoiled child at that.

1021
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:24,774
She's got to grow up.

1022
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,234
She's got to be made to realize

1023
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:27,610
that she can't go
running home to you

1024
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,821
every time there's something
that she doesn't like.

1025
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,660
Well, what do you want me to do?
Pack up and move?

1026
00:42:30,423 --> 00:42:32,592
-Hi, Pops.

1027
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,145
Forgot your key, I suppose.
Why didn't you ring?

1028
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,772
Oh.

1029
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,525
I didn't want to wake up
you and Moms.

1030
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,570
Anyway, I --

1031
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,031
Doctor told me to sleep
with plenty of fresh air.

1032
00:42:55,156 --> 00:42:57,200
Well, you certainly had your
share for tonight, I guess.

1033
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:58,534
Come on.

1034
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,913
First, I-I want you
to know this, Pops.

1035
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:03,456
I've left Buckley.

1036
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,208
I've left him for good.

1037
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,294
I wish you'd tell Moms for me.

1038
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,004
Ask her not to fuss.

1039
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,131
It's no use.

1040
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:15,218
It's over for good now.

1041
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:19,931
I'd rather not
have to talk about it.

1042
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:22,308
Alright, kitten, it'll be
however you want it.

1043
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:23,768
You know that.

1044
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:26,395
Come on, I'll have your room
ready for you in a jiffy.

1045
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:31,984
Oh, Pops, why did it
have to end like this?

1046
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:34,570
Everything was
so wonderful at first.

1047
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,740
I felt fine.
Everybody was so sweet to me.

1048
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,161
It takes too long, that's all.

1049
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,080
Drags on too long.

1050
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:48,084
I'm ugly now.

1051
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,335
I'm clumsy.

1052
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,879
Oh, darling.
Darling, don't say that.

1053
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,756
Don't you know that
you have a beauty now

1054
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,591
that you never had before?

1055
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,344
I know what I look like.

1056
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,806
I'm dull and stupid.

1057
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:04,642
I can't do any
of the things I used to do.

1058
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,604
Now when I need him most,
I've lost him.

1059
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:11,065
Doesn't love me anymore.

1060
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,234
Oh, kitten, you mustn't
think things like that.

1061
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,820
He loves you more than ever.
He's frantic with worry.

1062
00:44:15,945 --> 00:44:17,697
Well, he just said to me
if anything happened to you,

1063
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,282
he'd kill himself.

1064
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,202
What do you mean?

1065
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,745
Did he call you?

1066
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:26,789
He's right out there now.

1067
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:29,834
Oh!

1068
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,254
I suppose he told you
everything.

1069
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,798
Didn't tell me anything.
Just that you had an argument.

1070
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,426
An argument?

1071
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,179
That's wonderful.

1072
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,015
Do you know what it really is?

1073
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:46,976
There's someone else, Pops.

1074
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,187
He's found someone else.

1075
00:44:49,312 --> 00:44:51,189
He goes off
and leaves me every night

1076
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:55,860
and tells me he goes to
the office, but it isn't true.

1077
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:58,154
I've called the office,
and he isn't there.

1078
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:03,284
He's in love with someone else.

1079
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:09,207
Oh, darling, don't, don't.

1080
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:11,209
Please, don't, don't.

1081
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:15,087
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
You've got to get your rest now.

1082
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,174
I'll -- I'll send him away.

1083
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:19,717
I'll send him away.

1084
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,934
She's here.
She's been asleep.

1085
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,727
I wouldn't try to talk
to her if I were you

1086
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,896
in the mood she's in now.

1087
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:33,689
Did she say why we had a fight?

1088
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:34,815
Yes.

1089
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:39,779
Well, look, I'd like to say
something, just for the record.

1090
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:42,031
It's not true.
Not a word of it.

1091
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,033
I've been working every night.

1092
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:48,079
After all,
we're going to have a baby.

1093
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:50,873
You know,
I-I want to give him --

1094
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:55,253
She said that she phoned me
twice there, nobody answered.

1095
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:57,380
Believe me, it must have been
just a few minutes

1096
00:45:57,505 --> 00:45:59,090
I stepped out
for a cup of coffee.

1097
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:02,343
I told her this again and again.
She won't believe me.

1098
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,511
Well, you ought to
have more sense

1099
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:05,096
than to argue with her
at a time like this.

1100
00:46:05,221 --> 00:46:06,847
You know she isn't herself.

1101
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,809
Well, I'm not myself, either.

1102
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:15,398
Look, I even thought of having
a man call Kay and tell her --

1103
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:19,026
Then I said to myself,
"She doesn't believe me.

1104
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:21,570
She doesn't believe me
that I'm working like crazy

1105
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:23,781
night after night
for her and the baby.

1106
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,284
She doesn't take my word for it,
then it doesn't matter."

1107
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,536
It's finished anyway.
It's off. It's finished.

1108
00:46:28,661 --> 00:46:29,829
Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1109
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:31,163
We'll all talk about this
in the morning

1110
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:32,873
when we've had some sleep.

1111
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:35,960
As far as I'm concerned,
there's nothing more to say.

1112
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,462
May I use your phone?
I'd like to call a cab.

1113
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:41,007
I'll drive you home just as
soon as I get Kay settled.

1114
00:46:41,132 --> 00:46:43,843
Thanks, I'd rather take a cab.

1115
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:45,261
Suit yourself.

1116
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,976
He's calling a cab.

1117
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:57,481
I suppose he denied everything.

1118
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,775
He told me his side of it.

1119
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:02,028
Well, you don't
believe him, do you?

1120
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:04,530
Darling, I only know
that he really loves you.

1121
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,282
Oh, that isn't true.

1122
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:07,616
He doesn't love me.

1123
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:10,494
He doesn't care
whether I live or die.

1124
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,830
Oh, I never should
have married him.

1125
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,457
A little late
to think about that.

1126
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:16,167
Uh, come on, now.

1127
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:17,835
You really must get
your sleep, darling.

1128
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,295
Come on, come on, now.
I'm gonna --

1129
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,380
Forgive me for interrupting.

1130
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,924
Your phone is out of order.

1131
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,802
That's ridiculous.

1132
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,471
Out of order?

1133
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:44,320
Hello, hello, operator.

1134
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,532
You take him home, Pops.
I can take care of myself.

1135
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:49,909
Operator, op--

1136
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:53,204
You're not supposed to
carry things.

1137
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:55,206
You know that.
I'll take 'em up.

1138
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:56,540
We don't need your help.

1139
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:59,335
- Do we, Father?
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

1140
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,378
Here, I'll take 'em,
I'll take 'em.

1141
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,088
You don't have a room
for her down here,

1142
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:03,672
some place you could
fix up as a bedroom?

1143
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:04,673
There's a couch
in the living room

1144
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:06,550
if she wants to try that,
find it a little hard, maybe.

1145
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,761
You know you're not supposed to
walk up and down stairs.

1146
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,304
Another thing,
she's supposed to drink

1147
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,056
eight glasses of water a day.

1148
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:13,974
She forgets.
So if you could remind her.

1149
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,559
- I'll try.
- And her exercise.

1150
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:18,604
Dr. Nordell wants her to walk
two to three hours each day.

1151
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,815
An hour in the morning
and an hour in the afternoon,

1152
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,274
and we usually take
a walk in the evening.

1153
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,068
And she's supposed to be
in bed at 9:30.

1154
00:48:24,193 --> 00:48:25,861
- I'll try to remember.
- And the calcium pills.

1155
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,488
- Did you bring your pills?
- No, I forgot.

1156
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,824
- I'll go home and get them.
- Won't it do in the morning?

1157
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,909
I'll give them to your father
when he takes me home.

1158
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,203
- Now, then, your shoes.
- Buckley, really. Buckley.

1159
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,163
You know you can't
do them yourself.

1160
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,221
Oh, Buckley.

1161
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,223
Buckley, what's
happening to you?

1162
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,601
Haven't you heard?

1163
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:59,311
We're having a baby.

1164
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:13,469
Stanley, Stanley.

1165
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:22,228
Stanley, time to get up.

1166
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,151
Wake up, sleepyhead.

1167
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,250
<i>As the days went on and nothing
happened, the tension mounted.</i>

1168
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:49,004
<i>Buckley watched Kay
as if she were a time bomb.</i>

1169
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:51,340
That's a book.

1170
00:51:02,393 --> 00:51:04,270
Oh!

1171
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:05,938
What is it, Kay?
What's the matter?

1172
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:09,233
Oh, I reneged.

1173
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:12,361
I had a heart
in my hand all the time.

1174
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,572
I don't know what
I must be thinking about.

1175
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,994
<i>As November came and the great
event drew nearer and nearer,</i>

1176
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:22,246
<i>we all waited
with bated breath.</i>

1177
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:26,375
- Is that the phone?
- No, dear.

1178
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:34,174
Well, I guess I'll get
a little air.

1179
00:51:38,304 --> 00:51:40,472
- Stanley.
- Hmm?

1180
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,101
As long as you're going,
would you give this to Kay?

1181
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:46,437
K-- Who said
anything about Kay?

1182
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,733
<i>I never could fool Ellie.</i>

1183
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,403
<i>But I hoped I could fool Kay.</i>

1184
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:04,038
- Stanley! How are you?
- Hello, hello, hello.

1185
00:52:04,163 --> 00:52:06,123
- Hi, Pops.
- Hi.

1186
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:09,001
Is this a beautiful night?
Did you see those stars?

1187
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:11,003
Mom sent me over with this.

1188
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,130
Oh, thanks.

1189
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,799
Go on, go on, open it up.
Open it up. Don't mind us men.

1190
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:19,803
Let me take your coat.

1191
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,347
Oh, I can do it.
I can do it.

1192
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:22,765
Well, at least let me help you.

1193
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:24,183
Alright.

1194
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:30,564
I'm glad you came by tonight.

1195
00:52:30,689 --> 00:52:32,107
She's awfully low.

1196
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,902
- Anything wrong?
- No, no, she's just nervous.

1197
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:36,945
I wish you'd talk to her.

1198
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:39,031
- Oh, it's lovely.
- What is it?

1199
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,241
It's a beautiful bed jacket.

1200
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:43,077
Isn't that pretty?

1201
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,330
Hmm. Ho-ho.

1202
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:49,958
You certainly are going to knock
their eyes out at the hospital.

1203
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:51,877
I'll go pack it right now.

1204
00:52:53,462 --> 00:52:55,339
Kay, Kay, now that your
father's here, you won't mind.

1205
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:56,715
I'd like to get some cigarettes.

1206
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,133
You don't have to
run right along, do you?

1207
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,386
No, I can squeeze out
a couple of minutes, I guess.

1208
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:01,679
I won't be long.

1209
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,557
Hold everything till I get back.

1210
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,687
You look wonderful, kitten.

1211
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,021
Oh, I feel fine.

1212
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,190
It's just Buckley.

1213
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:16,026
I wish you'd talk to him.
He's so jittery.

1214
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,248
What's he jittery about?

1215
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:32,209
Oh, he -- he's afraid that,

1216
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:35,087
oh, something will go wrong.

1217
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,131
Oh.

1218
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:38,757
Shouldn't feel like that.

1219
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:43,303
Of course, I-I can't
tell him that, uh --

1220
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:44,722
that it's going to be easy
for you.

1221
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:46,682
It may not be, but...

1222
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:48,892
But I do know this,
that when the time comes,

1223
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:51,437
you -- you mothers seem
to have a courage

1224
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:54,273
and a strength
you never knew you had.

1225
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:56,817
I hope so.

1226
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,153
I hope so.

1227
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:03,115
As far as anything going wrong,
doctors and scientists

1228
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,825
have been working
for hundreds of years now

1229
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,535
so that you and your baby
can be safe.

1230
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,538
Nothing's going to go wrong.
You know that, don't you?

1231
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:12,374
I know.

1232
00:54:13,709 --> 00:54:14,960
Oh, Pops.

1233
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:17,254
I wish it was over.

1234
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,631
It will be soon, darling.

1235
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:24,553
I'm sure that when you hold
your baby in your arms,

1236
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:27,097
you'll think it was worth
anything you went through.

1237
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,601
Aren't I silly?

1238
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:33,187
Like the first day
you took me to the dentist.

1239
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:38,317
<i>Every night we put our clothes</i>

1240
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:41,236
<i>where we could grab them
in a hurry.</i>

1241
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:42,821
<i>We were like members
of a fire brigade</i>

1242
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,157
<i>ready to jump
at the first alarm.</i>

1243
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,744
Well, it'll happen
almost any time now, huh?

1244
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:52,331
I suppose so, sometime within
the next two or three weeks.

1245
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:53,415
Two or three weeks?

1246
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,210
I couldn't live like this
another two or three weeks.

1247
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:01,632
Hello.

1248
00:55:01,757 --> 00:55:05,594
Sorry to wake you, but I just
brought Kay to the hospital.

1249
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,012
Huh? No, I don't
know anything yet.

1250
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,180
The doctor's with her now.

1251
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,807
- We'll be right there.
- We'll be right there.

1252
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:20,901
Stanley, you can't do that.
You've got to really dress.

1253
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,903
There's no telling how long
we'll be down there.

1254
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,905
Did you remember to put
the razor in your pocket?

1255
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,782
- The razor?
- Yes, your electric razor.

1256
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:28,826
Then it doesn't matter
where you have to go to shave.

1257
00:55:28,951 --> 00:55:31,453
And a green shirt.

1258
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:35,249
You should wake Tommy, please,
and I guess we better wire Ben.

1259
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:37,334
You can phone the message in.

1260
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,336
I must remember to tell Delilah

1261
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:41,964
to fix breakfast in case
the baby's born by then.

1262
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:43,674
Stanley, please hurry.

1263
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:01,900
What kept you?

1264
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,570
I'm just getting dressed.
I had to get my clothes on.

1265
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,238
- I'll drive.
- Oh, no, no. Here, come on.

1266
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,739
If we don't hurry,
the baby will be born

1267
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:09,616
before we get there.
Come on.

1268
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,493
The baby will be born,
and we'll never get there

1269
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:12,661
if you drive.

1270
00:56:24,006 --> 00:56:25,591
Don't go so fast, Ellie.

1271
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:27,509
We're in a business district.

1272
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:35,183
Ellie, slow down a little bit.

1273
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:37,102
Uh-uh! Uh...

1274
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:40,772
Ellie, for heaven's sake.

1275
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:42,232
I had the right of way.

1276
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,525
Keep your eye on the road.

1277
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,777
Your tie's on crooked.
Fix it.

1278
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,075
Ellie, gasoline.

1279
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:57,247
Come on, now, Ellie.
Pull over here. Let me drive.

1280
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:59,249
- Come on.
- Stanley, be careful.

1281
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,501
No, no, no, Ellie,
you can't make it.

1282
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:02,586
There's a train.

1283
00:57:02,711 --> 00:57:04,796
Will you relax?
You're making me nervous.

1284
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:11,178
You realize what you've done?

1285
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:13,388
You've broken every
regulation in the book.

1286
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,057
You've passed everything
on the wrong side.

1287
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:17,309
You've gone through red lights.
You've exceeded the speed limit.

1288
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,436
I know, but this
is an emergency.

1289
00:57:19,561 --> 00:57:20,771
<i>For the first time in my life,</i>

1290
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:23,106
<i>I longed for the sight
of a motorcycle cop.</i>

1291
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:33,450
Park it, will you, Stanley.

1292
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:53,595
Oh, what's the matter?
What happened?

1293
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,432
Nothing happened.
It -- It was a false alarm.

1294
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,476
I'm sorry we brought you
all this way.

1295
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:02,813
Oh, that's alright.
Nothing at all, nothing at all.

1296
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:04,773
- Good night, darling.
- Good night.

1297
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,692
- Good night, Kay.
- Good night.

1298
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:08,026
I'm sorry.

1299
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:33,510
Is that your car?
The gray one over there.

1300
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:36,179
- Yes, it is.
- Is something wrong, Officer?

1301
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:37,848
Yes, lady, there is.

1302
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:40,058
He's parked in front
of a fire hydrant.

1303
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:45,689
<i>After a week, the strain
became too much for me.</i>

1304
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:47,733
<i>I decided to take
a sleeping pill.</i>

1305
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:10,380
Hello?
We'll be right there.

1306
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:11,465
What?

1307
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:13,633
It's already here.
It's a boy.

1308
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:16,011
He arrived
just half an hour ago.

1309
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:17,929
Huh, okay, he's fine.

1310
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:20,557
The doctor says
everything's just fine.

1311
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:21,600
Yeah.

1312
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:23,435
That's wonderful.

1313
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:24,895
Wonderful.

1314
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,564
Give her our love.

1315
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:29,107
Give her our love.

1316
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,027
Ellie.

1317
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,404
- Ellie.
- Hmm?

1318
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:36,239
Remind me to tell you
something in the morning.

1319
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:37,866
Will you, Ellie?

1320
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,083
Tell me what, Stanley?

1321
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:47,334
Tell me what?

1322
00:59:47,459 --> 00:59:48,919
Stanley, wake up.

1323
00:59:49,044 --> 00:59:51,421
Tell me, is it
something about Kay?

1324
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:53,423
- Stanley!
- It's a boy.

1325
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:54,925
Oh, Stan!

1326
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:57,803
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

1327
00:59:57,928 --> 00:59:59,513
A boy.

1328
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:39,302
<i>I wondered if they
were crazy or was I?</i>

1329
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:41,805
<i>He looked as old
as Methuselah to me.</i>

1330
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:43,140
<i>All he needed was a derby.</i>

1331
01:00:49,104 --> 01:00:51,481
Oh, boy!
We'll be seeing you soon.

1332
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:53,150
Yes, sir.
Look at him smile.

1333
01:00:53,275 --> 01:00:54,776
Isn't he a darling?

1334
01:00:54,901 --> 01:00:57,028
- Who do you think he's like?
- He looks exactly like Kay.

1335
01:00:57,154 --> 01:00:57,988
- Oh.
- Like Kay?

1336
01:00:58,113 --> 01:00:59,281
Oh, I think you're
wrong there, Ellie.

1337
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:00,448
He's a Dunstan
through and through.

1338
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:03,243
- What are they gonna call it?
- It? Call him, son. Him.

1339
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,787
I believe they're talking
about calling him Herbert.

1340
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,664
- Aren't they?
- I believe they are.

1341
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:10,167
Oh, Herbert,
isn't that wonderful?

1342
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:11,668
I hope you don't mind.

1343
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:13,879
I mean, since you're
the maternal grandfather, I --

1344
01:01:14,004 --> 01:01:16,131
Oh, no.
No, I should say. No.

1345
01:01:16,256 --> 01:01:18,466
Matter of fact, I think Herbert
is just the name for him.

1346
01:01:18,592 --> 01:01:20,969
Oh, well, I --

1347
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,387
<i>I admit, he looked
a little better</i>

1348
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:24,097
<i>by the time Kay got him home.</i>

1349
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,142
- Perfect.
- Look at him!

1350
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:29,686
Did you ever see
anything so good?

1351
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:32,606
Did'ums have'um picture taken?

1352
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:34,065
When is he going to
be christened?

1353
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:35,233
In five or six months.

1354
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,319
We want to wait
for Reverend Galsworthy.

1355
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:39,529
Come on, Pops, you have your
picture taken with the baby.

1356
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:41,281
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- We've all had our pictures.

1357
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:42,574
- No, no, not me.
- Come on, old man.

1358
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,784
Oh, please, Pops.
Come on, just do it for me.

1359
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:46,369
I want a picture
of the two of you together.

1360
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:48,038
Yeah, we'll sit him right here.

1361
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:50,165
How about that, my boy?
Is that alright with you?

1362
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:52,334
He's smiling at you.
Hurry, Stan.

1363
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:54,211
Catch him just like that.

1364
01:01:54,336 --> 01:01:56,796
No, no, I don't --
I just --

1365
01:01:56,922 --> 01:01:57,964
There we go.

1366
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:59,466
Oh, no, don't give it to me.

1367
01:01:59,591 --> 01:02:00,592
No, no, you sit down.

1368
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,719
Now go on,
smile at your grandfather.

1369
01:02:04,846 --> 01:02:07,349
- See, it's no use. I don't --
- Turn him around.

1370
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:09,142
Turn him around
so we can see his face.

1371
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,853
Come on, turn him around.
That's it. That's it.

1372
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:16,191
Oh, see, it's a --
Look, look.

1373
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:20,612
I-I mean, I-look --

1374
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,864
Take him, please.
Please, take him.

1375
01:02:22,989 --> 01:02:25,158
Oh, what's the matter?

1376
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:26,952
My goodness.

1377
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:28,536
Stanley, what'd you do to him?

1378
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:31,539
What do you mean?
I didn't do anything to him.

1379
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:34,584
I think he's tired.
We really must go.

1380
01:02:34,709 --> 01:02:38,004
By the way, Stan,
I had this made up for you.

1381
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:39,923
It's a photographic
record of the baby

1382
01:02:40,048 --> 01:02:41,383
from the day he was born.

1383
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:42,759
Here, look at him here.

1384
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:45,971
And then wait, wait.
Take a look at that.

1385
01:02:46,096 --> 01:02:47,597
And here, here.

1386
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:50,392
Isn't it amazing?
Well, he changes every day.

1387
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:51,851
Not to me, he doesn't.

1388
01:02:51,977 --> 01:02:54,271
- Coming, dearest?
- Here, put it in your pocket.

1389
01:02:54,396 --> 01:02:55,730
Show the boys, you know.

1390
01:02:57,065 --> 01:02:58,441
- Goodbye, dear.
- Good bye.

1391
01:02:58,566 --> 01:02:59,526
Goodbye, Stanley.

1392
01:02:59,651 --> 01:03:03,238
Take good care
of our "gweat bid" boy.

1393
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:05,282
- Come, dear.
- Coming, darling.

1394
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:08,660
How about a "gweat big" drink?

1395
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:11,788
- Pops?
- Yes, dear?

1396
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:14,082
- Come in. He's quiet now.
- Oh, no. Oh, no.

1397
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:15,375
Now, look, Kay, it's no use.

1398
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,294
Oh, Pops, it didn't have
anything to do with you.

1399
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:20,130
It's just that, well, there were
so many other people around him.

1400
01:03:20,255 --> 01:03:21,464
It scared him.

1401
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:22,757
Come on.

1402
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:30,765
Boy, he's gonna smile.

1403
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,976
Oh, come on in.

1404
01:03:33,977 --> 01:03:36,146
See, everything's alright now.

1405
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:39,357
He's not scared anymore.
Is he, darling?

1406
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:40,984
Now you've got a nice man here

1407
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:43,361
and you're gonna give him
a big smile

1408
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:45,405
'cause you're a good boy.

1409
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,615
Now, look who's come to see you.

1410
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:48,908
- Who is that, huh?
- Well.

1411
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:50,493
Who is that?

1412
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:53,371
Is that your grandfather?
Look.

1413
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:57,667
Oh, honey, you terrible child.

1414
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:02,005
What's the matter?
What happened?

1415
01:04:02,130 --> 01:04:04,424
Nothing, nothing, nothing.
He just took a look at me.

1416
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:07,052
That's so funny.
He's such a good-tempered baby.

1417
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:08,511
The doctor said
he'd never seen a baby

1418
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:09,679
with such a wonderful
disposition.

1419
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:11,014
Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure.

1420
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:12,182
And it isn't because
you're a man.

1421
01:04:12,307 --> 01:04:14,642
He was smiling all over
the place at Herbert.

1422
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:16,269
Pops?

1423
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:18,396
Well, now, come on.
Let's blow, let's blow.

1424
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,148
Pops?

1425
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,108
We've come to apologize.

1426
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:24,986
We want to say that we're
very sorry for being so rude.

1427
01:04:25,111 --> 01:04:27,238
Now, you tell him
you forgive him.

1428
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:29,741
Come on, now, honey,
give him a great big smile.

1429
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:32,285
Tell him how --

1430
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,913
- Oh, you little brat.
- Oh, it's alright, darling.

1431
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:36,581
He's gone now.
It's alright.

1432
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,875
- The man is gone.
- Why do you do that?

1433
01:04:40,168 --> 01:04:41,461
You know what I think it is?

1434
01:04:41,586 --> 01:04:43,713
It's your tie.
If you just take off your tie...

1435
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:45,382
No, Ellie, I'm not
going to take off my tie.

1436
01:04:45,507 --> 01:04:47,092
It's a perfectly nice tie,
and I happen to like it.

1437
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:48,343
It was present from Tommy,

1438
01:04:48,468 --> 01:04:50,637
and I'm not gonna take it off
just because he doesn't like it.

1439
01:04:50,762 --> 01:04:52,097
Oh, Stanley, the way you talk.

1440
01:04:52,222 --> 01:04:54,140
He's a baby,
an innocent little baby.

1441
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:55,725
He doesn't know what it is
that disturbs him.

1442
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:58,019
He is not an innocent
little baby.

1443
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:00,647
He's an individual with very
definite likes and dislikes.

1444
01:05:00,772 --> 01:05:02,399
As an individual,
I respect his right

1445
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:03,942
to have likes and dislikes.

1446
01:05:04,067 --> 01:05:07,404
But I also reserve the right
to have a few of my own.

1447
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:10,198
<i>From that time on,
I gave him a wide berth.</i>

1448
01:05:11,866 --> 01:05:13,410
<i>It was live and let live
between us</i>

1449
01:05:13,535 --> 01:05:15,745
<i>until one weekend
six months later.</i>

1450
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:28,383
This the Banks house?

1451
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:30,844
Well, yes, but, uh, wh--

1452
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:48,820
Hello! Thank you.

1453
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,405
Good evening, Mr. Banks.

1454
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:52,866
See you tomorrow.

1455
01:06:01,708 --> 01:06:04,377
<i>The thing I had feared
had come to pass.</i>

1456
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:07,797
<i>He had invaded
the sanctity of my home.</i>

1457
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:08,965
Hi, Pops.

1458
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,550
Hi, hi, Kay.

1459
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:13,219
You have a visitor.

1460
01:06:13,344 --> 01:06:15,388
It's alright with you, Pops,
and you don't mind?

1461
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:17,807
Oh, no, I'm delighted,
delighted.

1462
01:06:17,932 --> 01:06:19,267
He's nice, Pops.
Really is.

1463
01:06:19,392 --> 01:06:21,102
It's just that, well,
you two got started off

1464
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:22,312
on the wrong foot, that's all.

1465
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:24,314
And I thought,
well, if I left him here

1466
01:06:24,439 --> 01:06:25,773
for a couple of days
alone with you --

1467
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:26,941
Alone?

1468
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:28,651
Well, I mean,
I won't be here myself.

1469
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:29,986
I'm going to Boston.

1470
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:31,863
Buckley has to go there
and see Mr. Wellsford.

1471
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,699
You know, the chain store man.
And he asked me to come.

1472
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:37,202
And I said I couldn't leave the
baby, but Mom said to go ahead

1473
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:39,704
and that she'd take care.

1474
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,998
Oh, Pops, I know
you're gonna love him

1475
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:43,875
just as soon as you
get to know him.

1476
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,668
He has been a little strange.

1477
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:47,879
Oh, there's my taxi.
I gotta run.

1478
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,172
And remember this, Pops.

1479
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:50,757
If he so much as
lets out a peep at you,

1480
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:52,425
you have my permission
to spank him and spank him good.

1481
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,052
- Yeah.
- Bye. Bye, Mom.

1482
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:56,054
- Goodbye, goodbye, dear.
- Bye.

1483
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:02,101
Stan, is that you?

1484
01:07:04,812 --> 01:07:06,105
Yes, it's me.

1485
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:07,482
The most wonderful thing
has happened.

1486
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:08,942
I thought you'd never get here.

1487
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:11,903
Ah, ah, yes, Kay told me.

1488
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,821
Oh, come up and see him.
Quick, quick.

1489
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:26,876
Of course, we're not
quite organized yet.

1490
01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:28,586
Well, where is he?
I don't wanna step on him.

1491
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:30,171
In your bureau drawer
over there.

1492
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:45,520
What is that?

1493
01:07:45,645 --> 01:07:47,480
Well, that's my dress scarf.

1494
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:51,067
Well, what are you
doing with my dress --

1495
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:52,443
What?

1496
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:54,946
What's going on?

1497
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:57,865
Lookit here.

1498
01:07:57,991 --> 01:07:59,492
What are you doing with my --

1499
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:02,287
- Stanley, what'd you do?
- Well, he's eating my scarf.

1500
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:03,955
Oh, that's alright, dear.
It's clean.

1501
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:06,791
It can't hurt him.
Can it, my darling?

1502
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,835
Did he have to be
in that particular drawer

1503
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:09,877
with all my shirts?

1504
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:11,629
I took the shirts out.
They're right there.

1505
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,089
You can put them back now.

1506
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:15,800
What a love-kins.
Who's a love-kins?

1507
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:19,304
Oh, Stan, it's so wonderful
having a baby in my arms again.

1508
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:21,556
Who's a sweet boy?
Who's an angel?

1509
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:22,557
Look at the shirts.

1510
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:25,310
Who's going to sleep
in a nice big room, huh?

1511
01:08:25,435 --> 01:08:26,352
Is he going to sleep
in this room?

1512
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:27,604
No, he's going to Tommy's room.

1513
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:29,564
- Where's Tommy going?
- Into Ben's room.

1514
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:32,108
I want him right here
so I can hear him if he cries.

1515
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:34,444
You know, he's good, but
strange house and everything.

1516
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:37,488
No Mommy or Poppy, but he's
gonna be a good boy, isn't he?

1517
01:08:37,614 --> 01:08:38,615
Of course he is.

1518
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,241
I'm sorry I can't
go to the Dicksons',

1519
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:41,242
but you're going anyway.

1520
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:43,328
I phoned Ruth, and she's
delighted to have an extra man.

1521
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:44,954
- It's all set.
- Yeah, well, I'm not going.

1522
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,789
- Oh, now, Stanley.
- No, no, no.

1523
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:48,833
I'm not going without you.
They're your friends.

1524
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,335
Well, that's ridiculous.

1525
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,003
You can't eat here.
There's no food in the house.

1526
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,546
Of course, there's
last night's clam

1527
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:55,048
if you don't mind
waiting on yourself.

1528
01:08:55,173 --> 01:08:57,133
- Where's Delilah?
- She's making up Kay's room.

1529
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:58,468
Who's going to sleep
in Kay's room?

1530
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:00,011
- You are.
- Now, look, look, look.

1531
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,763
Stanley, it's the only room
in the house

1532
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:03,306
where you can't possibly
hear the baby,

1533
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:05,183
and I promised Kay
you wouldn't be disturbed.

1534
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:07,810
Everything's ready, Miss Banks.

1535
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:09,312
Oh, good, and, Delilah,

1536
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:11,147
would you mind taking these
and sterilizing them?

1537
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:12,398
You can use the canning pot.

1538
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:14,233
You don't have to tell me.
I remember.

1539
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:15,652
Mr. Banks,
isn't it just wonderful

1540
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:16,903
having a baby
in the house again?

1541
01:09:17,028 --> 01:09:18,404
Oh, just wonderful.
Just wonderful.

1542
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:19,739
Just wonderful.
Great, great.

1543
01:09:19,864 --> 01:09:21,991
Let's get your foot.
That's a boy.

1544
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:12,810
<i>All week I look forward
to Sunday morning.</i>

1545
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:15,146
<i>No alarm clock,
no train to catch,</i>

1546
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:18,149
<i>no office,
just uninterrupted slumber.</i>

1547
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:29,744
I just had to let you see him.
He's so cute.

1548
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:32,955
What time is it?

1549
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,415
6:00.

1550
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:36,584
6:00?!

1551
01:11:38,795 --> 01:11:40,379
Well, go back to sleep, dear.
Bye.

1552
01:11:40,505 --> 01:11:41,714
Say, "Bye-bye."

1553
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:43,132
Bye-bye.

1554
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:49,305
Oh, no. Oh, no.

1555
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,350
<i>Sunday afternoon,
I had counted on</i>

1556
01:11:52,475 --> 01:11:54,519
<i>a good 18 holes of golf.</i>

1557
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:56,979
<i>But Ellie thought the baby
and I should get together.</i>

1558
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:03,945
<i>45 minutes later,
he finally corked off.</i>

1559
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:39,689
Hey, hey, hey.

1560
01:12:39,814 --> 01:12:41,357
Here's your ball.

1561
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:16,767
Hey, wait, you tripped me!

1562
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:19,061
- I didn't!
- Yes, you did!

1563
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:21,981
Here, here, here, here.
Boys, boys, boys, boys.

1564
01:13:22,106 --> 01:13:23,232
Boys!

1565
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:24,734
Stop, stop, stop. Hey!

1566
01:13:24,859 --> 01:13:26,694
Come on, now, let's get over
there and let's do it right.

1567
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:29,363
Come on. What kind of a game
are you playing?

1568
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:33,576
<i>They were nice kids.
I was having a good time.</i>

1569
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:35,202
Look, come on.
Choose sides.

1570
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:54,472
- Thanks a lot.
- Well, thank you.

1571
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:55,932
You wanna watch that dribble,
get that...

1572
01:13:56,057 --> 01:13:58,100
<i>It was a good game.</i>

1573
01:13:58,225 --> 01:14:00,728
<i>I was wondering whether or not
to tell Ellie about it.</i>

1574
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:02,355
<i>She'd probably think
I was crazy</i>

1575
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,231
<i>playing ball with
a lot of kids.</i>

1576
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:36,889
Where do you think
you're going with it?

1577
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:39,892
I'm -- I'm sorry.

1578
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:56,033
<i>I suddenly thought maybe
Ellie came and got him.</i>

1579
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,508
I didn't take the train.
I flew.

1580
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:14,677
I got so homesick for the baby.

1581
01:15:14,802 --> 01:15:16,846
Where is the baby?
Shouldn't he be home by now?

1582
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:17,930
Don't you worry.

1583
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:19,515
He's with your father,
so he's alright.

1584
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,975
You should see your father..

1585
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:35,990
Hey!

1586
01:15:38,826 --> 01:15:39,994
Police station.

1587
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:41,579
Hurry up.

1588
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,838
Hello, hello?
Is anybody here?

1589
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:53,007
Anybody here?
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

1590
01:15:54,675 --> 01:15:57,053
Officer, Officer, has anybody
turned in a baby here?

1591
01:15:57,178 --> 01:15:58,262
I've lost a baby.

1592
01:16:06,312 --> 01:16:07,480
Is it your baby?

1593
01:16:07,605 --> 01:16:08,981
Oh, no, no, no, no,
it's my daughter's baby.

1594
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:10,733
- It's my grandson.
- Where'd you lose him?

1595
01:16:10,858 --> 01:16:11,817
I-I lost him in the park.

1596
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:13,736
He was in the park
in his carriage.

1597
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:14,820
I left him for a second.

1598
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:16,739
When I came back he was gone
and the carriage was gone.

1599
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:18,032
You say you only left him
for a second, eh?

1600
01:16:18,157 --> 01:16:19,742
Well, maybe a minute.
I don't know, five minutes.

1601
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:21,118
You know,
some kids were playing soccer.

1602
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:22,787
And I went to watch them,
got kind of interested.

1603
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:24,789
And you forgot your grandchild.

1604
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:26,540
Well, I guess I did
for the minute.

1605
01:16:26,665 --> 01:16:28,584
That's fine.
That's wonderful.

1606
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:30,878
They give you a child to mind,
and you run off and forget him.

1607
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:32,922
What's the matter, Jack?
You losing your marbles?

1608
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:34,840
Now, wait a minute.
This kind of talk is --

1609
01:16:34,965 --> 01:16:37,093
Do you -- Did you
understand what I said?

1610
01:16:37,218 --> 01:16:39,428
A baby has been lost.
A little baby has --

1611
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:40,888
Why don't you do what
you're supposed to do?

1612
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:42,431
Do something.
Get on the television.

1613
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:44,767
Tell the typer, whatever you do.
Describe the baby.

1614
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:46,936
He's five months --
six months old.

1615
01:16:47,061 --> 01:16:49,772
Wearing a little white --
You know what babies wear.

1616
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:53,442
He's got -- got on
a little cap, I think.

1617
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:54,860
Would you know what
color his eyes are?

1618
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:57,655
Brown. Brown. Brown. Blue.
I-I don't know.

1619
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:59,782
But you are sure it's a boy.

1620
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:02,118
I don't blame you.
I don't blame you.

1621
01:17:02,243 --> 01:17:04,036
You haven't said anything to me
I haven't said to myself.

1622
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:05,621
My daughter's home now
waiting for the baby.

1623
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:07,039
I don't know what to do.
I'm going crazy.

1624
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:08,207
I'll -- I'll do anything.

1625
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:11,085
Look, I'll have a big reward,
whatever, whatever I have to do

1626
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:12,211
if you'll just help me.

1627
01:17:12,336 --> 01:17:14,797
Well, it just so happens
we picked up your baby.

1628
01:17:14,922 --> 01:17:15,965
Oh, thank God.

1629
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:17,508
But it wasn't any five minutes
you were gone.

1630
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,218
It was nearer a half an hour.

1631
01:17:20,094 --> 01:17:21,470
Yes, sir.

1632
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:23,013
- Where is he? In here?
- Yeah.

1633
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:24,515
Just a minute.

1634
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:25,683
What's your daughter's
phone number?

1635
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:26,851
I'm gonna call her up and check.

1636
01:17:26,976 --> 01:17:28,394
Oh, no, don't do that.
Don't, please.

1637
01:17:28,519 --> 01:17:30,271
Please don't do it.
Don't do it. You don't know.

1638
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:32,815
I couldn't stand it.
I couldn't face my daughter.

1639
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:35,192
Please, I promise you, I'll do
anything if you give me the kid.

1640
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:37,111
I'll take him right home.
I won't stop anywhere.

1641
01:17:37,236 --> 01:17:39,196
I promise you.

1642
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:41,282
Well, I'll talk it over
with the boys.

1643
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:44,285
They've taken quite
a fancy to this kid.

1644
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:46,078
If they get any idea
you weren't treating him right,

1645
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:47,955
you'd never get
out of here alive.

1646
01:17:49,748 --> 01:17:51,250
Alright, boys,
they've come for him.

1647
01:17:54,587 --> 01:17:56,881
<i>I dreaded the moment
when he'd see me.</i>

1648
01:17:57,006 --> 01:18:00,301
<i>I knew if he started to cry,
I was cooked.</i>

1649
01:18:00,426 --> 01:18:03,971
<i>I said a little prayer, "Don't
let him cry just this once.</i>

1650
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:05,639
<i>Don't let him cry."</i>

1651
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:11,854
Come on, son, we're going home.

1652
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:19,028
Come on! Whoa!

1653
01:18:20,821 --> 01:18:22,531
Well, that's my boy.

1654
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:24,325
That's my boy.

1655
01:18:27,328 --> 01:18:29,788
<i>From that time on,
I was his pigeon.</i>

1656
01:18:43,928 --> 01:18:46,722
Yes, yes!

1657
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:49,058
<i>The day of the baby's
christening came at last.</i>

1658
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:50,476
<i>He was the center
of a little world.</i>

1659
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:52,811
<i>His grandparents, his parents,
and his godparents,</i>

1660
01:18:52,937 --> 01:18:56,023
<i>all of us gathered together
for the solemn occasion.</i>

1661
01:18:56,148 --> 01:18:57,942
<i>I couldn't help feeling
we were ganging up on him,</i>

1662
01:18:58,067 --> 01:19:01,570
<i>pinning the name of Herbert
on a poor, defenseless child.</i>

1663
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:04,114
"Suffer the little children
to come unto me

1664
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,866
and forbid them not.

1665
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:08,410
For of such is
the kingdom of God."

1666
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:10,913
<i>Funny how I had resented
the very idea of him</i>

1667
01:19:11,038 --> 01:19:13,040
<i>when Kay first told us.</i>

1668
01:19:13,165 --> 01:19:15,542
<i>I was furious at both of them.</i>

1669
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:18,170
<i>Making me grandfather.</i>

1670
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:20,923
<i>It seemed to spell
the end of my life.</i>

1671
01:19:21,048 --> 01:19:23,592
<i>Now I couldn't imagine
life without him.</i>

1672
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:26,929
...our heavenly Father
now and forever more.

1673
01:19:27,054 --> 01:19:28,347
Amen.

1674
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:32,268
<i>We were coming
to his big moment.</i>

1675
01:19:32,393 --> 01:19:34,728
<i>We all watched him
with bated breath.</i>

1676
01:19:36,522 --> 01:19:39,566
<i>How would he behave
when the Reverend Galsworthy</i>

1677
01:19:39,692 --> 01:19:40,818
<i>took him in his arms?</i>

1678
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:43,195
<i>Would he be terrified?
Would he cry?</i>

1679
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:45,406
<i>Not that baby.</i>

1680

<i>To him the Reverend Galsworthy</i>

1681
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,451
<i>was just another face
to be explored.</i>

1682

of the Father,

1686
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:28,240
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

1687

<i>Stanley Banks, my grandchild.</i>
