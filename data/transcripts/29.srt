1
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,820
<i>- Hello, Pete.</i>
- You've got a wrong number.

2
00:05:22,244 --> 00:05:24,439
<i>Don't hang up on me again, Pete.</i>

3
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,874
<i>If I was a cop or one of the boys,</i>
<i>I wouldn't bother calling,</i>

4
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:30,417
<i>- I'd just walk in on you.</i>
- I'm trying to tell you, you got a...

5
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:32,783
I'm doing the telling, Pete.

6
00:05:33,155 --> 00:05:36,056
I didn't crack to the clerk
your name's not Johnson.

7
00:05:36,525 --> 00:05:37,924
Listen, whoever you are...

8
00:05:37,993 --> 00:05:40,154
<i>I'm your one chance to get out from under.</i>

9
00:05:40,262 --> 00:05:43,561
<i>Three hundred grand and clean getaway.</i>
<i>Out of the country.</i>

10
00:05:46,535 --> 00:05:47,559
Who is this?

11
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:50,802
If you're interested, come to Room 302,

12
00:05:50,872 --> 00:05:52,863
Baker Hotel, 10:00 tonight.

13
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:55,967
Hey, wait a minute!

14
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:50,230
Come in.

15
00:07:09,217 --> 00:07:11,651
No change, Pete? Still jumpy.

16
00:07:13,455 --> 00:07:16,481
That was a sucker move,
burning down your boss.

17
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:20,553
You had him all wrong.
He never crossed you.

18
00:07:20,996 --> 00:07:23,965
But you're a guy who shoots first
and thinks afterward.

19
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:28,001
In your spot I'd almost choose the cops,

20
00:07:29,337 --> 00:07:31,931
even if it is a first degree murder rap.

21
00:07:32,374 --> 00:07:33,864
It's lucky I spotted you.

22
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,778
What's so lucky about being dead?

23
00:07:37,078 --> 00:07:39,569
I'm going to take care of a guy,
just a little too smart.

24
00:07:39,881 --> 00:07:41,109
Take off the mask.

25
00:07:42,017 --> 00:07:44,679
Come on, take it off. I don't like games.

26
00:07:54,196 --> 00:07:55,561
What makes a two-bit heel like you

27
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,860
think a heater would give him an edge
over me?

28
00:07:57,933 --> 00:08:00,163
I ought to ram it down your throat.

29
00:08:01,102 --> 00:08:05,095
What's waiting for you, Harris?
The chair? The gas chamber?

30
00:08:05,173 --> 00:08:06,197
Or just a rope?

31
00:08:06,408 --> 00:08:09,844
How do I know that line you handed me
on the phone's on the level?

32
00:08:09,911 --> 00:08:11,708
Your voice don't even sound the same.

33
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,613
Neither will yours
when you put on a mask.

34
00:08:15,116 --> 00:08:18,347
- Who else figures in it besides me?
- You ask too many questions.

35
00:08:18,487 --> 00:08:21,923
And I'm not getting any answers.
I like to know who I work with.

36
00:08:22,123 --> 00:08:24,990
When do we make the split?
And who do I take my orders from?

37
00:08:25,193 --> 00:08:26,558
Get out of here.

38
00:08:30,465 --> 00:08:32,399
All right, I'll get out.

39
00:08:34,836 --> 00:08:37,999
Fat choice you're giving me.
You know the bind I'm in.

40
00:08:38,373 --> 00:08:40,341
Take it or leave it.

41
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,739
You said three hundred grand for my end?

42
00:08:43,812 --> 00:08:46,804
At least, free and clear,
only you do it my way.

43
00:08:47,115 --> 00:08:50,016
Nobody sees the others without a mask,
even when we make the split,

44
00:08:50,118 --> 00:08:52,609
and I decide where and when
that takes place.

45
00:08:52,854 --> 00:08:54,617
That makes it all foolproof.

46
00:08:58,927 --> 00:09:02,920
Okay, you got yourself a boy, now what?

47
00:09:03,365 --> 00:09:06,994
Stay in your room.
Keep out of sight till I call you.

48
00:09:15,043 --> 00:09:18,240
Do a little thinking next time,
before you use it.

49
00:09:24,286 --> 00:09:28,154
Don't get any wrong ideas about me.
I don't shove around this easy.

50
00:09:28,256 --> 00:09:31,157
I'll give you a chance to show me how
hot you are on the job.

51
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:58,883
You're a three-time loser, Tony.

52
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:02,078
Not yet, I ain't.

53
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:05,057
The police know
you drove the getaway car.

54
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,495
This time it's life and no chance of parole.

55
00:10:10,298 --> 00:10:14,200
This time, Tony, you go up for life
under the Habitual Criminal Act,

56
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:15,998
with no chance of parole.

57
00:10:16,905 --> 00:10:18,805
You don't have to tell me the score.

58
00:10:19,407 --> 00:10:22,865
- Then it is a deal?
- Okay.

59
00:10:23,912 --> 00:10:27,313
But no dames, understand? No dames.

60
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:32,647
Look, friend, if you don't like it,

61
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,787
don't knock it.

62
00:10:47,836 --> 00:10:51,033
What makes you think I can't go on
doing all right?

63
00:10:51,106 --> 00:10:54,405
If I can spot you back of those
trick cheaters so can the cops.

64
00:10:56,511 --> 00:11:00,345
This job you're talking about.
I'd said I'd listen.

65
00:11:00,415 --> 00:11:04,249
You're a cop-killer.
You killed one on that last deal.

66
00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:06,845
I don't like heroes.

67
00:11:07,422 --> 00:11:11,586
You can tell that to the warden
when they burn you.

68
00:11:16,464 --> 00:11:18,955
So, I'm still listening.

69
00:11:42,123 --> 00:11:45,820
- Why don't you watch where you're going?
- I'm sorry, lady, I didn't see you.

70
00:13:17,252 --> 00:13:18,685
Here's the description, Mac.

71
00:13:18,753 --> 00:13:23,622
All units stand by, a 117.
Attention all units, a 117.

72
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:26,483
Here's a description of the suspects
involved in the armed robbery

73
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:29,155
of the Southwest Bank.
Three men, masked,

74
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,256
wearing identical coveralls.
They are driving a light delivery car

75
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,665
belonging to the
Western Wholesale Florists.

76
00:13:34,736 --> 00:13:37,466
Use extreme caution. All are armed.

77
00:14:26,855 --> 00:14:28,186
Pull over.

78
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,099
80 K to Control 2, on that 117,

79
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:40,634
we have the suspect florist truck.

80
00:14:40,802 --> 00:14:42,167
Twentieth and Jackson.

81
00:14:42,237 --> 00:14:44,137
- Hey, what is this?
- Put your hands on the back of your neck

82
00:14:44,205 --> 00:14:46,366
- and come on out.
- Come on, come on, get out.

83
00:14:46,641 --> 00:14:48,108
You guys nuts?

84
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:50,409
- Shut up.
- You, in there, come on out.

85
00:14:50,478 --> 00:14:52,275
One at a time, with your hands in the air.

86
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:57,181
All right, you, if your pals have any ideas,
you'd better start talking.

87
00:14:57,852 --> 00:14:59,979
- You're going to open it.
- Open what?

88
00:15:00,054 --> 00:15:02,181
You're crazy!
There's nothing in there but flowers.

89
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,649
Open it.

90
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:14,726
Where'd you drop them off? Come on, talk.

91
00:15:26,514 --> 00:15:28,778
We must have rolled 300 miles.

92
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:31,010
If they ain't dropped us by now,
they'll never get us.

93
00:15:31,085 --> 00:15:33,610
When do we make the split?

94
00:15:33,688 --> 00:15:35,519
The split's
what I'm gonna talk about.

95
00:15:36,624 --> 00:15:40,754
Four kings, a pat hand.
That's just what we're holding.

96
00:15:43,398 --> 00:15:45,389
Hang on to those cards.

97
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:48,592
I've got everything covered, but in case
something does go wrong

98
00:15:48,703 --> 00:15:51,934
and I can't make the payoff myself,
the cards will identify you

99
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,598
to whoever I send with the money.

100
00:15:53,675 --> 00:15:55,040
Say that again.

101
00:15:55,109 --> 00:15:58,510
We'll cut up the money when I think it's
had time enough to cool off.

102
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:01,742
Right now is good enough for me.
Let's cut this horsing around.

103
00:16:01,816 --> 00:16:03,408
How far do you think you'd get
with hot money?

104
00:16:03,484 --> 00:16:05,384
Every cop in the state's out looking for us.

105
00:16:05,453 --> 00:16:07,512
- I'll take my chances.
- I told you, the mask stays on.

106
00:16:07,588 --> 00:16:09,385
Sure you told us.

107
00:16:13,127 --> 00:16:15,857
It's a pat hand only because nobody can
rat on you.

108
00:16:16,864 --> 00:16:18,525
You can't even rat on each other

109
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,930
because you've never seen each
other without those masks.

110
00:16:21,502 --> 00:16:23,595
I've made you cop-proof
and stoolpigeon-proof

111
00:16:23,671 --> 00:16:25,263
and it's going to stay that way.

112
00:16:25,406 --> 00:16:28,068
- Talk money.
- All right.

113
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:33,108
I got one of these for each of you,

114
00:16:33,181 --> 00:16:35,376
with enough money to keep you
comfortable while you're waiting,

115
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,315
but not enough to get you into trouble.

116
00:16:37,385 --> 00:16:40,320
For the 300 G's that's coming to me,
I can stand a little trouble.

117
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:43,055
Make up your mind.
Which way's it gonna be?

118
00:16:48,863 --> 00:16:50,831
You'll find tickets for where you're going.

119
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:54,162
You're each going to a different
foreign country. Stay there

120
00:16:54,502 --> 00:16:56,595
till I wire you where and when to come,

121
00:16:56,971 --> 00:17:00,498
and keep those masks.
You'll be wearing them at the payoff.

122
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:04,136
This is where you got off. Hit that buzzer.

123
00:17:07,482 --> 00:17:09,211
Open the door.

124
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,753
Jump!

125
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:25,663
- What about me?
- I'll tell you when.

126
00:17:37,345 --> 00:17:39,643
It's odd that you'd stop at that florists
next to the bank

127
00:17:39,714 --> 00:17:40,908
twice in the same morning.

128
00:17:40,982 --> 00:17:42,210
Once was all I was there.

129
00:17:42,283 --> 00:17:44,217
Then the woman who identified
you is a liar?

130
00:17:44,452 --> 00:17:45,851
No, she's telling the truth.
I did bump into her.

131
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,548
And the other witnesses who swear
your truck was the getaway car,

132
00:17:48,623 --> 00:17:49,715
they're telling the truth, too?

133
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,884
They're wrong if they say I had anything
to do with the robbery.

134
00:17:52,093 --> 00:17:54,254
You want me to believe
there was a duplicate truck.

135
00:17:54,328 --> 00:17:55,989
I wouldn't know. I wasn't there.

136
00:17:56,064 --> 00:17:58,396
- You were framed, then. Is that it?
- Yeah.

137
00:17:58,466 --> 00:18:01,264
And that year you spent in the pen?
Did anyone frame you on that rap?

138
00:18:02,003 --> 00:18:04,403
Ask the Captain here,
he was the arresting officer.

139
00:18:04,972 --> 00:18:06,769
A real model citizen.

140
00:18:07,341 --> 00:18:10,401
Look, just because I got in a
jam over a gambling bet

141
00:18:10,478 --> 00:18:12,343
doesn't make me a bank robber.

142
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,971
The boy wants pity.
What about the truck?

143
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:18,114
If I knew the answer to that,
I wouldn't be here now.

144
00:18:18,186 --> 00:18:20,746
How's this for an answer?
There was no other truck.

145
00:18:21,389 --> 00:18:23,186
Listen, I...

146
00:18:24,992 --> 00:18:27,222
Mr. Andrews, here,
with the insurance company,

147
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:28,557
he's willing to give you a break,

148
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:29,755
aren't you, Scott?

149
00:18:30,698 --> 00:18:33,792
- He knows we are.
- Same questions, same answers.

150
00:18:33,868 --> 00:18:36,701
- You can save your breath.
- It's my job, Joe.

151
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:39,871
After all, we've got to make good the loss.

152
00:18:40,007 --> 00:18:44,171
In fact, we're willing to pay out as
much as 25% of the money as a reward.

153
00:18:44,812 --> 00:18:47,303
That's $300,000 for a lead, Joe.

154
00:18:49,016 --> 00:18:51,416
You're an industrial engineer, aren't you?

155
00:18:51,486 --> 00:18:53,716
- I never graduated.
- That's right.

156
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:56,120
Left school to enlist with the engineers.

157
00:18:56,924 --> 00:19:00,655
Pretty good soldier, too.
Bronze Star, Purple Heart.

158
00:19:00,895 --> 00:19:03,159
Try and buy a cup of coffee with them.

159
00:19:03,297 --> 00:19:07,131
Came back to resume his studies at night.
Why?

160
00:19:07,435 --> 00:19:09,869
Why? I ask myself,
would a man with such training

161
00:19:09,937 --> 00:19:11,461
want to take a job outside his line?

162
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:13,939
To set up a touch for
over a million dollars, that's why.

163
00:19:15,042 --> 00:19:18,500
I got the job through the probation officer.
You can ask him.

164
00:19:19,213 --> 00:19:21,511
Mr. Collins, did I ever give you any trouble
when I worked for you?

165
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:23,874
No, Joe, not at all.

166
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:27,181
But I'm afraid I've got to let you go now.

167
00:19:27,355 --> 00:19:30,950
Nothing personal, you understand.
It's just that... Well,

168
00:19:31,025 --> 00:19:33,755
we sell to a lot of
very conservative people.

169
00:19:34,362 --> 00:19:36,523
- You know how it is.
- Yeah, I know how it is.

170
00:19:36,697 --> 00:19:39,461
Sergeant, see that Mr. Collins gets back.

171
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:42,998
I'll go along with him.
Some questions I want to ask.

172
00:19:51,946 --> 00:19:54,972
All right, Rolfe, you want it the hard way,
I can fix that too.

173
00:19:55,049 --> 00:19:57,313
You've got 20 years staring you
right in the face.

174
00:19:57,385 --> 00:20:00,445
What do you want me to say? That I did it?

175
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:04,814
Why don't you go ahead, Mr. Martin?
You got a big day tomorrow.

176
00:20:05,226 --> 00:20:07,956
The boys will help me keep
Rolfe company.

177
00:20:15,937 --> 00:20:18,098
What do you think, McBride?

178
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:19,972
I think if you left him to me and the boys,

179
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:24,102
I'd have his confession on your desk,
the first thing in the morning.

180
00:20:34,589 --> 00:20:37,183
We'll be back after him,
first thing in the morning.

the big bank stickup.

Extra!
Ex-con grilled on a million-dollar grab!

183
00:21:46,694 --> 00:21:50,755
Okay, we'll take him once more.

184
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:55,229
You got visitors again, Rolfe.

185
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:04,410
- Come on, move.
- McBride.

186
00:22:08,749 --> 00:22:10,580
We've got to turn him loose.

187
00:22:10,651 --> 00:22:13,620
The upstate police found a duplicate
florist truck half an hour ago.

188
00:22:14,088 --> 00:22:18,684
- It was inside an abandoned moving van.
- That still doesn't clear Rolfe, in my book.

189
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:21,557
His part of the job could have been to use
his truck as a blind,

190
00:22:21,629 --> 00:22:23,187
to draw us away
from the real getaway car.

191
00:22:23,264 --> 00:22:25,892
- It could have been anything!
- Just give me a little more time.

192
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,024
I'll sweat it out of him.

193
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:29,467
Forget it, McBride. I've checked every
move he's made. He's clean.

194
00:22:31,238 --> 00:22:34,696
All right, Rolfe, you can go.
Sorry we had to detain you.

195
00:22:37,011 --> 00:22:39,445
- You're sorry?
These things happen.

196
00:22:44,285 --> 00:22:47,083
Thanks for nothing.

197
00:22:48,656 --> 00:22:50,715
Go on, beat it.

198
00:22:52,593 --> 00:22:57,326
Maybe you didn't hear what I said.
I said, "For nothing."

199
00:23:11,045 --> 00:23:15,914

Get the latest news on the...

203
00:23:29,463 --> 00:23:33,160
Hey! That's him. That's the guy.

204
00:23:44,478 --> 00:23:46,605
You got to do it, Rick.

205
00:23:46,781 --> 00:23:48,612
You don't understand, Rick.

206
00:23:49,483 --> 00:23:52,418
I know the spot you're in,
Rick, but you gotta help Joe.

207
00:23:55,055 --> 00:23:57,216
Rick! Rick!

208
00:24:03,697 --> 00:24:05,597
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi, Eddie.

209
00:24:05,866 --> 00:24:08,460
- Get you something?
- Yeah, two things,

210
00:24:09,203 --> 00:24:11,433
a cup of coffee and that
information you promised me.

211
00:24:12,506 --> 00:24:15,703
It's like I told you, the first one is easy.

212
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:21,475
Listen, Eddie, I've gotta know
who set me into this little deal.

213
00:24:21,816 --> 00:24:23,408
Did you ask him?

214
00:24:23,584 --> 00:24:25,347
You're leading with your chin, Joe.

215
00:24:26,487 --> 00:24:29,354
So I'm leading with my chin.
What have I got to lose?

216
00:24:29,523 --> 00:24:32,219
Look, Eddie! It's been three weeks.
No job, no angle, no nothing.

217
00:24:32,293 --> 00:24:36,127
Hey, okay, okay.
Take it easy. I'm on your side.

218
00:24:39,066 --> 00:24:41,899
I'll get you another cup of coffee.

219
00:24:49,109 --> 00:24:52,977
You come back tonight
around closing time.

220
00:25:23,377 --> 00:25:26,175
Kid brother says you're in trouble, Joe.

221
00:25:26,647 --> 00:25:29,138
I got to find a way to clear myself.

222
00:25:29,717 --> 00:25:31,912
Sometimes it's tough, Joe.

223
00:25:31,986 --> 00:25:36,047
- Sometimes it's too tough.
- Look, I want to know who framed me.

224
00:25:37,625 --> 00:25:41,356
- It wasn't anyone local that's for sure.
- Any ideas?

225
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,419
Maybe.

226
00:25:45,466 --> 00:25:49,596
Might be why Pete Harris
beat it to Mexico.

227
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:53,197
Pete Harris? Where in Mexico?

228
00:25:55,976 --> 00:26:01,505
Tijuana. Look for him where the dice roll.
He's a real sucker for a crap game.

229
00:26:03,217 --> 00:26:07,210
- Anything else?
- Kind of dark and real weird eyes.

230
00:26:08,155 --> 00:26:11,522
You won't have any trouble finding him
by the cigarettes he smokes.

231
00:26:11,825 --> 00:26:16,353
- Just follow the chain.
- Much obliged.

232
00:26:17,364 --> 00:26:18,888
Good luck, Joe.

233
00:26:21,902 --> 00:26:26,396
- Take it easy, Joe.
- Thanks, kid.

234
00:26:31,078 --> 00:26:34,377
So, that's the guy that saved your life
on lwo Jima?

235
00:26:35,983 --> 00:26:38,008
I'd buy him.

236
00:27:30,471 --> 00:27:32,871
I have the name of Diaz, <i>señor.</i>

237
00:27:34,141 --> 00:27:38,271
If you are looking for a good time,
I know all the best places in Tijuana.

238
00:27:39,346 --> 00:27:41,280
Long as there's a dice table there.

239
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,779
- But gambling is illegal.
- Yeah?

240
00:27:44,918 --> 00:27:47,443
But like in the States, <i>señor,</i>

241
00:27:47,521 --> 00:27:49,682
there are some things
the law does not know.

242
00:27:49,957 --> 00:27:52,482
I will show you
where is a nice game of chance.

243
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,621
Okay.

244
00:27:57,364 --> 00:27:59,628
All right.
Place your bets, boys.

245
00:28:00,467 --> 00:28:01,456
Place your bets.

246
00:28:16,116 --> 00:28:20,177
All right, all bets down. Coming out.
Shooter's coming out.

247
00:28:21,722 --> 00:28:23,485
- Eight of clubs.
Eight of clubs, go!

248
00:28:28,962 --> 00:28:30,657
Watch the dice, boys.
Come on.

249
00:28:31,832 --> 00:28:33,197
Seven up! You lose.

250
00:28:33,267 --> 00:28:36,395
All right.
Throw that guy in the bucket if you're off...

251
00:28:38,472 --> 00:28:41,930
- Know any other spots?
<i>- Si, señor,</i> but I lose all my money.

252
00:28:46,747 --> 00:28:47,873
Come on.

253
00:28:50,084 --> 00:28:52,109
Check the card game.

254
00:28:53,387 --> 00:28:55,116
Okay, all bets. Hands off the table.

255
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,614
Come on, there. Come on.

256
00:28:57,758 --> 00:28:59,521
I'm gonna let mine ride.
What about that?

257
00:29:01,895 --> 00:29:03,362
Light, Mac?

258
00:29:08,702 --> 00:29:09,896
Thanks.

259
00:29:13,307 --> 00:29:14,899
All right, move around, everybody.

260
00:29:14,975 --> 00:29:16,602
If you're not shooting,
get away from the table.

261
00:29:16,677 --> 00:29:19,407
Let the betters in. All right, let the dice go.

262
00:29:19,513 --> 00:29:22,539
And he's coming out.
- Come on dice, get hot.

263
00:29:22,716 --> 00:29:25,082
And he went away
with a four-trey.

264
00:29:25,219 --> 00:29:27,153
It's not your night, bud. Next shooter.

265
00:29:27,421 --> 00:29:29,218
Come on, now,
give me something on the field.

266
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:31,484
You can't go wrong with the big six
or the big eight!

267
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:34,584
And don't overlook that
ever loving any-craps. It's overdue, men.

268
00:29:34,728 --> 00:29:37,720
- $20, he don't hit.
You got a bet, Mister.

269
00:29:37,998 --> 00:29:41,991
Coming out,
the big miss, box cars.

270
00:29:42,402 --> 00:29:44,893
All right, take the inside
and pay the outside.

271
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:46,733
Double up after craps, men.

272
00:29:46,807 --> 00:29:49,275
One good one makes up
for all the bad ones.

273
00:29:49,943 --> 00:29:52,070
You might as well be broke
as not have enough.

274
00:29:52,146 --> 00:29:53,943
All right, here we go.

275
00:29:54,448 --> 00:29:57,144
Let the piece ride.
I'm still saying he can't do it.

276
00:29:57,417 --> 00:29:59,078
Make him
eat those words, Mister.

277
00:29:59,153 --> 00:30:00,211
And another $20.

278
00:30:00,988 --> 00:30:05,391
There they go
and he's got nine for a number.

279
00:30:05,526 --> 00:30:07,892
He makes nine for all the money.

280
00:30:08,295 --> 00:30:11,731
3- to-2, you can't not.
- I'll take 50-to-25 I make it.

281
00:30:11,999 --> 00:30:14,524
No bet. It's a 3-to-2 wager.

282
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:18,605
I'll cover that.

283
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:26,102
All right, boys. Come on, now.
Give me something on the field.

284
00:30:26,914 --> 00:30:29,212
And the shooter's coming out
on a gravy train.

285
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:34,013
That devil jumped up.
He went away with seven.

286
00:30:34,087 --> 00:30:36,715
Take the inside, pay the outside.

287
00:30:37,357 --> 00:30:39,154
You wanted me to tell you
when it was 10:30, fellow.

288
00:30:39,226 --> 00:30:41,421
- All right.
All right.

289
00:30:41,595 --> 00:30:43,688
- All right, let the dice go.
No more bets.

290
00:30:43,764 --> 00:30:44,924
Come on, dice. Get hot.

291
00:30:44,998 --> 00:30:46,158
And he went away
with a four-trey.

292
00:30:46,233 --> 00:30:47,257
Four-trey.

293
00:30:47,334 --> 00:30:49,734
And we're coming out
with a brand new shooter.

294
00:30:49,803 --> 00:30:51,100
Don't overlook the field, men.

295
00:30:51,171 --> 00:30:53,332
Can't go wrong with a
big six and a big eight.

296
00:30:53,407 --> 00:30:55,705
Can somebody give me something for
that every loving, no-craps?

297
00:30:55,776 --> 00:30:57,004
It's overdue, men.

298
00:31:00,013 --> 00:31:03,574
- Who's that guy, just came in?
- I don't know, some tourist. Why?

299
00:31:04,084 --> 00:31:07,417
I don't know. Gives me the willies.
He just don't smell right to me.

300
00:31:10,324 --> 00:31:11,791
So long, Diaz.

301
00:31:17,831 --> 00:31:19,924
Next shooter coming up.

302
00:31:22,436 --> 00:31:25,894
- What's your hurry, fellow?
- Do you mind?

303
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,471
For a guy who did all right, you seem to
be in too much of a hurry.

304
00:31:30,077 --> 00:31:32,272
- Is there a law against it?
- Maybe.

305
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,510
Who sent you here, fellow?

306
00:31:36,216 --> 00:31:38,184
Diaz, the cab driver.

307
00:31:40,187 --> 00:31:41,779
Okay, fellow.

308
00:31:50,497 --> 00:31:52,021
Okay, wise guy.

309
00:31:54,701 --> 00:31:56,669
You found me. Now what?

310
00:31:58,138 --> 00:31:59,833
What's eating you?

311
00:31:59,907 --> 00:32:02,899
You've been giving me
the fish eye all night.

312
00:32:05,545 --> 00:32:08,844
You better see a doctor, Mac.
You're in bad shape.

313
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,711
I ain't that sick.

314
00:32:12,185 --> 00:32:16,144
Then stop imagining things.
Get some rest.

315
00:33:24,124 --> 00:33:26,922
- Who is it?
A man downstairs to see you.

316
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:32,965
Look, you tell that guy...

317
00:33:36,636 --> 00:33:38,467
Now, you and I are gonna have a little talk.

318
00:33:38,538 --> 00:33:40,062
You a cop?

319
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,598
That's to teach you manners.
I'm the guy that drove a florist truck.

320
00:33:43,844 --> 00:33:45,869
I don't know what you're talking about.

321
00:33:45,946 --> 00:33:47,413
Take a good look, Pete.

322
00:33:47,748 --> 00:33:50,216
You're looking at the patsy who was
framed for the kill.

323
00:33:51,718 --> 00:33:53,515
You got the wrong guy.

324
00:33:55,022 --> 00:33:57,513
- Lay off, will you?
- When you're ready to talk.

325
00:33:57,824 --> 00:34:00,691
- You got me wrong.
- What'd you do with your cut, Pete?

326
00:34:01,361 --> 00:34:03,693
- I don't follow you.
- You will.

327
00:34:05,332 --> 00:34:07,300
There's no money in there!

328
00:34:25,118 --> 00:34:28,110
- You were one of them, weren't you?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

329
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:34,650
Listen, this ain't my bag.
I copped it out of a car.

330
00:34:34,828 --> 00:34:37,888
- You're lying.
- Give me that.

331
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:45,736
What's this plane ticket? This wire?
What's so interesting in Borados?

332
00:34:47,841 --> 00:34:50,139
So, we start all over again.

333
00:34:51,378 --> 00:34:55,747
Go ahead, go ahead, but I still don't know
what you're talking about.

334
00:34:57,751 --> 00:35:00,652
If I can't open you up, maybe the cops can.

335
00:35:02,222 --> 00:35:03,348
Wait!

336
00:35:04,357 --> 00:35:05,551
No cops.

337
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,119
- So, you were one of the gang?
- I had other reasons.

338
00:35:11,498 --> 00:35:13,557
I'm interested in this one.

339
00:35:15,969 --> 00:35:19,735
Your plane leaves in 50 minutes, Pete.
You're not gonna be on it.

340
00:35:24,044 --> 00:35:27,411
Look, I gotta get to Borados.

341
00:35:27,614 --> 00:35:30,447
That wire means 300 grand to me.

342
00:35:30,584 --> 00:35:33,109
Your cut? Who set it up?

343
00:35:33,487 --> 00:35:38,584
I don't know.
Look, we didn't have nothing against you.

344
00:35:38,925 --> 00:35:41,894
We didn't even know you.
It just fell that way.

345
00:35:42,028 --> 00:35:44,087
Lucky me! Who else was in on it?

346
00:35:44,197 --> 00:35:47,655
I don't know that either.
We all four of us wore masks.

347
00:35:47,801 --> 00:35:49,325
I thought there were only three.

348
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:51,403
Three and the big guy.

349
00:35:52,472 --> 00:35:54,531
Look, look, I'm giving it to you straight.

350
00:35:54,608 --> 00:35:57,600
That's the way it was planned.
We all did business with a mask.

351
00:35:57,978 --> 00:36:01,209
He could know us, but none of us
could know him. Get it?

352
00:36:01,281 --> 00:36:04,717
None of us could squeal that way
if one of us didn't get away.

353
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:08,210
That explains everything but this.

354
00:36:09,923 --> 00:36:13,290
I won't know what that means
till I get there.

355
00:36:13,793 --> 00:36:15,761
All right, partner.

356
00:36:15,929 --> 00:36:19,092
- We'll find out together.
- Partner?

357
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:23,361
The big man set me in on this,
so we split five ways.

358
00:36:24,671 --> 00:36:26,662
You're kidding.

359
00:36:26,973 --> 00:36:30,101
If I don't split five ways,
there's gonna be no split at all.

360
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:33,602
Okay, go ahead, hang yourself.

361
00:36:33,947 --> 00:36:35,915
- It'll be a pleasure.
- All right.

362
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:39,810
So, I'm moving blind
but I got you for a bird dog

363
00:36:40,086 --> 00:36:44,955
- to point the way as we go along.
- You forget, even I don't know the big guy.

364
00:36:45,959 --> 00:36:49,588
So, I'm taking a chance, but remember...

365
00:36:50,197 --> 00:36:54,657
I'm taking no chances with you between
here and Borados, partner.

366
00:36:57,938 --> 00:37:01,738
Now, get ready.
We don't want to miss our plane.

367
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:13,776
<i>Mexicana de Aviación</i>
<i>announces the departure of its flight...</i>

368
00:37:13,853 --> 00:37:16,845
- Give me some cigarettes.
- In the machine, <i>señor.</i>

369
00:37:16,923 --> 00:37:20,017
<i>Passengers, kindly board your plane</i>
<i>to the local gateway.</i>

370
00:37:20,293 --> 00:37:22,557
<i>Flight 589, now boarding.</i>

371
00:37:22,696 --> 00:37:25,824
<i>Flight 589, now boarding.</i>

372
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:31,896
- I want a ticket to Borados.
- Yes, sir.

373
00:37:32,305 --> 00:37:33,465
You just have time.

374
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,634
You make connections for
Borados in Mexico City, 10:30 a.m.

375
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,237
- Round trip?
- One way.

376
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,777
That will be $92, please.

377
00:37:47,254 --> 00:37:51,850
Hey, Barney, look who's here.
Over by the cigarette machine.

378
00:37:52,692 --> 00:37:55,183
Familiar?

379
00:37:56,796 --> 00:38:01,062
- That's Pete Harris. Go ahead, brace him.
- So it is.

380
00:38:02,068 --> 00:38:05,970
- Don't worry about this boy.
- You stay here.

381
00:38:16,349 --> 00:38:17,441
Cops.

382
00:38:30,897 --> 00:38:33,798
I don't get it.
This man reached for a gun and he's clean.

383
00:38:34,301 --> 00:38:37,498
Don't worry, <i>señor,</i>
this man's wanted for murder.

384
00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:44,736
All that dough...

385
00:38:47,347 --> 00:38:51,750
What's that he's trying to say
about dough? What dough, Pete?

386
00:38:53,553 --> 00:38:55,714
You haven't got a chance, Pete,
but you can go out clean.

387
00:38:55,855 --> 00:38:57,914
He's right, Pete.
Tell us about the dough.

388
00:38:59,693 --> 00:39:01,786
Who was down here with you?
What are you doing in Mexico?

389
00:39:01,861 --> 00:39:03,624
Where were you going?

390
00:39:04,564 --> 00:39:08,056
Got anything you want to tell us?
You haven't got a chance.

391
00:39:16,943 --> 00:39:19,605
Is he trying to tell us
that somebody's down here with him?

392
00:39:19,746 --> 00:39:21,270
Sounds like it. Maybe there is.

393
00:39:21,614 --> 00:39:24,139
The ambulance will be here at once.

394
00:39:26,052 --> 00:39:27,986
This is a laugh.

395
00:39:30,323 --> 00:39:32,188
- All that dough.
- What dough?

396
00:39:33,626 --> 00:39:35,253
What dough, Pete?

397
00:39:36,963 --> 00:39:38,555
Have to ask...

398
00:39:39,532 --> 00:39:41,295
Ask who, Pete?
Come on, Pete.

399
00:39:41,368 --> 00:39:43,700
Time's running out. Tell us. Who?

400
00:39:45,004 --> 00:39:45,993
Ask...

401
00:39:47,874 --> 00:39:51,503
Pete! Pete!

402
00:40:05,225 --> 00:40:08,752
You forgot your claim check, <i>señor.</i>
Your baggage is aboard the plane.

403
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:14,362
Thanks.

404
00:40:18,238 --> 00:40:21,571
<i>Attention. Would</i>
<i>Mr. Pete Harris please board the plane?</i>

405
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:24,070
<i>Flight 589 now leaving.</i>

406
00:40:44,431 --> 00:40:46,831
- Good morning, my customers.
- Good morning.

407
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:49,698
It looks like maybe today
it's going to rain, finally.

408
00:40:49,769 --> 00:40:51,828
I hope so. At least it'll cool off.

409
00:40:51,938 --> 00:40:54,463
Then everyone can go outside and play.

410
00:40:54,674 --> 00:40:56,642
<i>Buenos días, Señor</i> Kane.

411
00:40:58,244 --> 00:41:03,272
Well now, <i>Señor</i> Romano,
I see you have found something you want.

412
00:41:04,951 --> 00:41:08,045
- Perhaps you will like this one.
- Yeah.

413
00:41:08,321 --> 00:41:11,449
- Don't you want to buy it?
- It's not bad for a bottle.

414
00:41:12,792 --> 00:41:16,159
- How much?
- Only 11 American dollars.

415
00:41:16,896 --> 00:41:18,363
Eleven bucks?

416
00:41:18,832 --> 00:41:22,097
But, of course, <i>señor,</i>
if you're looking for something cheap...

417
00:41:22,735 --> 00:41:24,760
I get nothing but the best.

418
00:41:26,072 --> 00:41:28,563
Then shall I wrap it
into a nice package for you?

419
00:41:29,843 --> 00:41:33,040
Don't bother.
I bought it for a nice package.

420
00:41:35,815 --> 00:41:38,716
But <i>señor,</i> you're too generous.

421
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:42,279
That will be 11 American dollars.

422
00:41:46,226 --> 00:41:48,888
Charge it, with the rest.

423
00:41:58,071 --> 00:42:00,972
That Teresa, she is a jewel.

424
00:42:01,341 --> 00:42:03,571
The smartest girl that ever worked for me.

425
00:42:04,744 --> 00:42:08,145
That's the 12th time she has
sold that same bottle of perfume.

426
00:42:08,681 --> 00:42:12,139
On that kind of business, I can afford
to give her 50% commission.

427
00:42:13,219 --> 00:42:17,280
- Who is that <i>vaselino?</i>
- He came here yesterday.

428
00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:19,322
You mean to tell me
you been here two hours

429
00:42:19,392 --> 00:42:20,916
and not met Tony Romano?

430
00:42:21,027 --> 00:42:23,154
- Come, I'll introduce you.
- Don't bother.

431
00:42:23,229 --> 00:42:26,357
Say, Tomaso, why doesn't it rain if
it's gonna?

432
00:42:26,666 --> 00:42:29,965
The one thing I have no control over,
the rain.

433
00:42:31,004 --> 00:42:34,963
Yeah, the minute I get outside, though,
it'll start coming down like...

434
00:42:36,276 --> 00:42:38,107
- Cats and dogs.
Morning.

435
00:42:38,177 --> 00:42:41,044
<i>- Señor</i> Foster!
- Good morning, Tomaso.

436
00:42:41,948 --> 00:42:45,145
- What's everybody so gloomy about?
The weather, <i>señor.</i>

437
00:42:45,218 --> 00:42:47,846
- She's so uncertain.
- Up in the States, they're having blizzards.

438
00:42:49,155 --> 00:42:51,749
If something like that would
only happen here.

439
00:42:52,258 --> 00:42:57,161
But no. Nothing but sunshine
and people catching fish.

440
00:42:57,463 --> 00:43:00,455
If just once a fish would catch a man.

441
00:43:00,533 --> 00:43:03,263
That's possible, Tomaso.
All depends on the bait.

442
00:43:03,703 --> 00:43:06,399
<i>Señor</i> Foster, <i>Señor</i> Kane.

443
00:43:06,472 --> 00:43:07,871
How do you do, Mr. Kane?

444
00:43:08,474 --> 00:43:10,442
- You look right at home here.
- Should be.

445
00:43:10,577 --> 00:43:12,568
I've been coming down here every season
for a good many years.

446
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:15,307
<i>Señor</i> Foster,
I have your tobacco for you.

447
00:43:15,882 --> 00:43:19,716
Good, Teresa. I was almost out.

448
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,547
- Good fishing.
- Thank you.

449
00:43:23,122 --> 00:43:25,955
When are you going to try your hand
at some of this fishing, Mr. Romano?

450
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:29,117
In this heat? I got better sport.

451
00:43:31,764 --> 00:43:34,995
- How about some cards again tonight?
- I'll give you a chance to get even.

452
00:43:35,935 --> 00:43:37,664
Come early and bring a lot of money.

453
00:43:59,892 --> 00:44:01,621
Hi, Tim.

454
00:44:04,764 --> 00:44:05,992
Glad to see you, Scott.

455
00:44:06,065 --> 00:44:09,523
Well, you're certainly looking in the pink.
That little girl of yours? How is she?

456
00:44:10,136 --> 00:44:13,537
She's a big girl, now.
She's home preparing for her bar exams.

457
00:44:13,606 --> 00:44:15,164
Be a lawyer any day.

458
00:44:15,241 --> 00:44:18,301
It's been years since
anyone's seen you around the old haunts.

459
00:44:18,578 --> 00:44:23,015
Yeah, two years, one month and
eight days since I got my walking papers.

460
00:44:24,484 --> 00:44:26,543
Still bitter, Tim?

461
00:44:26,619 --> 00:44:29,281
You spend 20 years of your life being a cop
and then get thrown out.

462
00:44:29,355 --> 00:44:31,448
What am I supposed to do,
stand up and cheer?

463
00:44:31,658 --> 00:44:35,321
Well, maybe it was time to get out.
It was beginning to affect your health.

464
00:44:35,962 --> 00:44:38,522
Call it forced retirement.

465
00:44:38,598 --> 00:44:40,930
All right, Scott, forced retirement.

466
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,398
"You backed the wrong party,
Captain Foster,

467
00:44:43,469 --> 00:44:45,664
"so now we've got ourselves a new boy."

468
00:44:46,172 --> 00:44:47,605
I call it a frame.

469
00:44:47,674 --> 00:44:49,642
Well, whatever it was,
you've been through it.

470
00:44:49,742 --> 00:44:52,210
It'll only stir up old memories.

471
00:44:52,445 --> 00:44:55,073
How about that urgent telegram
to meet you here?

472
00:44:55,615 --> 00:44:58,243
How far did you ever get on that
Southwest Bank job?

473
00:44:58,384 --> 00:45:00,011
Exactly nowhere!

474
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,055
You must be hearing plenty from the
front office on that one.

475
00:45:04,891 --> 00:45:06,552
You don't know the half of it.

476
00:45:06,626 --> 00:45:10,426
Every bank in the country is on the alert
to spot the serial number of those bills,

477
00:45:10,797 --> 00:45:13,789
and, up to now,
not one of them has turned up.

478
00:45:14,534 --> 00:45:17,059
How'd you like to crack that job?

479
00:45:18,004 --> 00:45:20,564
How would I like to find oil
in my back yard?

480
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:23,504
I don't know, but I might be able
to deliver that gang to you.

481
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:25,405
You wouldn't fool an old friend, Tim.

482
00:45:25,945 --> 00:45:29,278
It might not be anything, and, then again,
it could be just what you're looking for.

483
00:45:29,749 --> 00:45:33,708
I've been watching a couple of strange
characters drift in here one at a time.

484
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:36,552
Name Boyd Kane mean anything to you?

485
00:45:36,656 --> 00:45:40,456
Kane? Yeah,
I want him for a jewelry store holdup.

486
00:45:41,694 --> 00:45:44,561
- I knew that when I sent you the wire.
- Who else?

487
00:45:44,797 --> 00:45:47,061
A prize package by the name
of Tony Romano.

488
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:50,397
Should fit into a touch like that bank job.

489
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:52,738
They're playing it like
they don't know each other,

490
00:45:53,272 --> 00:45:56,105
but it's an old act any cop could spot,
so I listened.

491
00:45:56,275 --> 00:45:58,573
Yeah, but there's supposed
to be three of them.

492
00:45:58,711 --> 00:46:01,976
That's where it begins to make sense.
Third one's due to arrive.

493
00:46:02,048 --> 00:46:04,642
That ties in. Anything else?

494
00:46:05,752 --> 00:46:08,744
The talk is about a money split.
Big money.

495
00:46:09,021 --> 00:46:11,785
The kind that could have come out of
that Southwest Bank job.

496
00:46:11,858 --> 00:46:13,883
What a sweet break.

497
00:46:14,427 --> 00:46:18,363
They get together for a split
and put their necks right into a noose.

498
00:46:18,965 --> 00:46:20,956
How do we handle it, Tim?

499
00:46:21,267 --> 00:46:24,828
Keep out of sight until I call you.
You better line up the police.

500
00:46:25,538 --> 00:46:27,506
- Where can I reach you?
- El Nacional.

501
00:46:27,774 --> 00:46:29,537
- Thanks, Tim.
- Good.

502
00:46:29,776 --> 00:46:32,870
You any idea how
much reward this will bring in?

503
00:46:33,713 --> 00:46:35,305
Well, it should be plenty.

504
00:46:35,715 --> 00:46:38,980
25% of what the
insurance company stand to lose,

505
00:46:39,051 --> 00:46:41,781
and that's over a quarter of a million.

506
00:46:42,555 --> 00:46:44,147
That's a lot of money.

507
00:46:44,624 --> 00:46:47,354
And you're the cop
they said was played out.

508
00:47:22,562 --> 00:47:25,588
- Do you like it?
- Nice.

509
00:47:32,104 --> 00:47:35,096
<i>Señorita</i> Helen,
but what a surprise!

510
00:47:35,174 --> 00:47:38,075
We did not expect you.

511
00:47:41,981 --> 00:47:44,449
- Take care of your guest, <i>amigo.</i>
- But of course.

512
00:47:44,517 --> 00:47:46,849
- If <i>señor</i> wants to sign the register...
- Thanks.

513
00:47:52,625 --> 00:47:54,559
You are from Tijuana, Mexico, <i>señor.</i>

514
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,754
- I have a married sister living there.
- You have?

515
00:48:00,366 --> 00:48:03,802
Come with me, <i>señor.</i>
I will show you which bungalow is yours.

516
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:06,964
- Follow me.
- I'll see you later.

517
00:48:07,173 --> 00:48:10,040
- Thanks for the company.
- My pleasure.

518
00:48:32,999 --> 00:48:35,126
- Not bad at all.
- I am Teresa.

519
00:48:35,201 --> 00:48:37,635
I sell souvenirs. You are here for fishing?

520
00:48:38,738 --> 00:48:40,330
I'm here for a vacation.

521
00:48:40,539 --> 00:48:43,975
That is good.
Then you have come to the right place.

522
00:48:45,378 --> 00:48:49,712
Tell me, that fellow playing pool,
who's he?

523
00:48:50,082 --> 00:48:52,209
He's...
Wouldn't you like to buy something?

524
00:48:52,285 --> 00:48:55,015
You know, presents, souvenirs,
things to send back home.

525
00:48:56,756 --> 00:48:58,121
Maybe.

526
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:00,385
Very special ladies' perfume?

527
00:49:01,661 --> 00:49:03,253
How about the fellow at the pool table?

528
00:49:03,963 --> 00:49:07,797
That is <i>Señor</i> Kane. He arrived
this morning but he is not very sociable.

529
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,494
All the time he's chewing bubblegum.

530
00:49:11,604 --> 00:49:15,040
- And the other fellow?
- You mean <i>Señor</i> Romano?

531
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:18,471
Now that one, he's very sociable.

532
00:49:22,281 --> 00:49:23,543
Thanks.

533
00:49:31,657 --> 00:49:34,455
You won't forget about the souvenir?

534
00:49:36,529 --> 00:49:38,997
What's a vacation without souvenirs?

535
00:50:19,205 --> 00:50:21,639
Hi, fisherman. What luck!

536
00:50:23,242 --> 00:50:24,334
Helen.

537
00:50:27,713 --> 00:50:29,806
For a minute I thought
you weren't glad to see me.

538
00:50:29,882 --> 00:50:32,407
Glad to see you? You know
I'm always glad to see you, pumpkin,

539
00:50:32,485 --> 00:50:33,918
but you come barging in here...

540
00:50:33,986 --> 00:50:36,921
What are you doing here? You...
I thought you had a lot of studying to do.

541
00:50:36,989 --> 00:50:39,287
I've got news, Dad, important news.

542
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:41,622
There's nothing more important
than your law exams.

543
00:50:41,694 --> 00:50:45,255
Sure there is. You are.
That's why I'm here.

544
00:50:45,331 --> 00:50:48,323
You know, being a law student
has its advantages.

545
00:50:48,401 --> 00:50:51,461
I set up a brief and brought it
to the Mayor myself.

546
00:50:51,537 --> 00:50:55,371
You sound just like a lawyer.
Let's have the facts.

547
00:50:55,441 --> 00:50:57,568
All right, Dad, facts.

548
00:50:57,643 --> 00:51:00,441
I got the Commissioner
to reopen your case.

549
00:51:03,115 --> 00:51:04,343
Well, don't you understand, Dad?

550
00:51:04,417 --> 00:51:06,544
It's a chance for you to get back
on the force.

551
00:51:06,619 --> 00:51:09,986
Forget it. It's too late.
I don't want to get back on the force.

552
00:51:10,289 --> 00:51:12,655
Now, look Dad,
this is your daughter, Helen.

553
00:51:12,725 --> 00:51:14,192
Don't fool me.

554
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:17,752
I know what it's meant to you being
forced into retirement through politics.

555
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:19,730
This is your chance to come back.

556
00:51:19,799 --> 00:51:22,791
You're not going to let pride
get in the way.

557
00:51:22,868 --> 00:51:25,302
All right, pumpkin. Thanks.

558
00:51:25,371 --> 00:51:28,636
Now, you're gonna turn right around
and go home to those law books.

559
00:51:29,708 --> 00:51:32,336
I'm taking a week's vacation with study.

560
00:51:34,213 --> 00:51:37,444
Besides, I kind of like a young man
who just checked in.

561
00:51:37,516 --> 00:51:39,279
His name is Pete Harris.

562
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:53,962
Our husbands.
Fishing all day and sleeping all night.

563
00:51:54,033 --> 00:51:56,501
This is supposed to be our vacation.

564
00:51:56,569 --> 00:52:00,403
If they'd only stay awake.
I wouldn't even mind if they played poker.

565
00:52:00,473 --> 00:52:03,601
Remember, Olson?
Biggest sailfish I ever latched onto.

566
00:52:03,676 --> 00:52:05,803
Must have weighed 140,
if he weighed a pound.

567
00:52:05,878 --> 00:52:08,312
- Up ten.
- Just when I had him softened up,

568
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:11,781
- ready to land, the leader breaks on me...
- Look, fella,

569
00:52:11,851 --> 00:52:14,979
right now, we're playing stud, remember?

570
00:52:15,054 --> 00:52:17,318
The man just boosted a ten.

571
00:52:18,491 --> 00:52:21,551
Sorry. Beats me.

572
00:52:22,261 --> 00:52:24,889
Go ahead. Deal.

573
00:52:29,935 --> 00:52:31,926
Trying to outdraw me, huh?

574
00:52:32,004 --> 00:52:34,939
Maybe. You're high, bet your queens.

575
00:52:35,708 --> 00:52:38,472
Check to you.
Check.

576
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:45,343
Twenty-five...
Just see you. Jack and Jill.

577
00:52:45,417 --> 00:52:48,079
- Three fours.
- How do you like that guy?

578
00:52:48,154 --> 00:52:49,781
Souvenir, <i>señor?</i>

579
00:52:53,025 --> 00:52:54,993
Come on over and take a hand.

580
00:53:00,299 --> 00:53:04,099
- Sit down. I'll give you a stack of chips.
- Shall I deal you in?

581
00:53:05,271 --> 00:53:07,205
Looks like you're doing all right
without me.

582
00:53:07,273 --> 00:53:12,006
<i>Señor</i> Harris, meet <i>Señor</i> Foster.
He wins all the time.

583
00:53:12,077 --> 00:53:14,637
<i>Señor</i> Romano, he lose all the time.

584
00:53:15,414 --> 00:53:17,882
<i>Señor</i> Morelli,
he worries more about fishing.

585
00:53:19,518 --> 00:53:21,611
Glad to know you, gentlemen.

586
00:53:21,687 --> 00:53:24,815
I'm warning you, don't let
that Boy Scout look of Foster's fool you.

587
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:28,724
He's had me on the hook ever since
I've been here. He's dynamite.

588
00:53:29,094 --> 00:53:32,621
His daughter warned me about him.
I promise to be careful.

589
00:53:32,698 --> 00:53:35,394
He hasn't learned
a man should never press bad luck.

590
00:53:35,467 --> 00:53:39,130
Yeah.
Expect to be around this tank awhile?

591
00:53:39,205 --> 00:53:41,400
I don't know. A while, maybe.

592
00:53:41,473 --> 00:53:43,270
Where you from?

593
00:53:43,342 --> 00:53:45,674
Kansas City, originally.

594
00:53:47,613 --> 00:53:50,605
Used to know a girl there, swell cook.

595
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:54,949
- You want to bet that ace of yours?
- Oh, yeah.

596
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:00,215
Five skins. Just to bring in the suckers.

597
00:54:00,292 --> 00:54:02,624
- I'm in.
- Pass.

598
00:54:02,695 --> 00:54:03,753
By me.

599
00:54:05,698 --> 00:54:09,134
- Let's make it 10 to keep them out.
- See what I mean?

600
00:54:10,102 --> 00:54:11,660
I'll call.

601
00:54:11,737 --> 00:54:13,671
Looks like you've got yourself a pigeon.

602
00:54:13,739 --> 00:54:15,798
Always room for one more, Tony.

603
00:54:22,881 --> 00:54:26,214
Well, you can cash me in.

604
00:54:26,285 --> 00:54:30,221
- I think I owe you about $10.
- You're not quitting so early?

605
00:54:30,289 --> 00:54:34,020
Sure. I thought I'd take a walk through
the village before I turn in.

606
00:54:34,093 --> 00:54:36,926
Don't walk too fast. You'll be out of town
without even seeing it.

607
00:54:36,996 --> 00:54:38,930
Ten dollars is right, <i>Señor</i> Harris.

608
00:54:38,998 --> 00:54:41,091
Come back some more.
We need loser players.

609
00:54:52,077 --> 00:54:53,840
My good luck piece.

610
00:54:54,346 --> 00:54:57,281
Souvenir of the biggest pot
I ever sat in on.

611
00:54:58,384 --> 00:55:02,286
Don't let me break up the game.
See you later, gentlemen.

612
00:55:02,354 --> 00:55:04,481
Good night, gentlemen.

613
00:58:35,667 --> 00:58:38,500
What's the idea, tossing my joint?

614
00:58:39,371 --> 00:58:41,305
I didn't mean nothing.

615
00:58:41,974 --> 00:58:45,137
I figured you meant to give me the office
when you dropped that card on the table.

616
00:58:46,378 --> 00:58:48,243
What's with you, chum?

617
00:58:48,313 --> 00:58:52,147
- Look, I had to be sure before I cracked.
- Go on.

618
00:58:53,652 --> 00:58:56,780
It don't take no big thinking
to figure a couple of guys like us

619
00:58:56,855 --> 00:58:59,688
ain't in this bananaville on a vacation.

620
00:59:00,158 --> 00:59:03,685
Here... I'm just going for my wallet.

621
00:59:12,004 --> 00:59:13,733
My calling card.

622
00:59:18,210 --> 00:59:21,373
You must have been one of the guys
in the van.

623
00:59:21,446 --> 00:59:22,743
Yeah.

624
00:59:23,949 --> 00:59:25,746
You were outside doing the driving.

625
00:59:29,321 --> 00:59:33,621
I'm sorry I had to rough you up.

626
00:59:35,861 --> 00:59:37,488
No hard feelings.

627
00:59:39,998 --> 00:59:42,558
I'd have done the same in your spot.

628
00:59:44,036 --> 00:59:46,630
One will get you ten
I got the other guy uncovered too.

629
00:59:46,705 --> 00:59:48,639
- Who?
- Kane.

630
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:53,609
Could be.

631
00:59:57,015 --> 01:00:00,644
Two more days and we'll be living it up.

632
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:05,856
Just think, over 300,000 smackers.

633
01:00:05,924 --> 01:00:08,654
- If we get it.
- What do you mean "if"?

634
01:00:08,727 --> 01:00:10,718
Let's not kid ourselves.

635
01:00:11,797 --> 01:00:13,628
We don't even know who he is.

636
01:00:13,699 --> 01:00:16,224
We wouldn't know where to find him
if he didn't show up.

637
01:00:16,301 --> 01:00:18,132
But why would he bring us here
if he ain't level?

638
01:00:18,203 --> 01:00:20,000
Search me.

639
01:00:20,072 --> 01:00:22,836
But I don't like working for someone
I don't know,

640
01:00:22,908 --> 01:00:26,139
especially if he can recognize me
and I can't recognize him.

641
01:00:26,211 --> 01:00:27,678
Neither do I.

642
01:00:30,816 --> 01:00:32,784
How about this guy Kane?

643
01:00:33,752 --> 01:00:35,083
Could he be Mr. Big?

644
01:00:35,153 --> 01:00:38,088
Are you kidding?
That gum-chewing character?

645
01:00:39,257 --> 01:00:40,849
Could be an act.

646
01:00:41,827 --> 01:00:44,921
Yeah, could be.

647
01:00:47,232 --> 01:00:48,699
You know,

648
01:00:50,535 --> 01:00:54,232
I think I'll get myself some gum.

649
01:00:54,306 --> 01:00:56,968
Yeah. I got you.

650
01:00:57,275 --> 01:00:58,537
See you.

651
01:01:35,781 --> 01:01:37,009
Hi!

652
01:01:47,225 --> 01:01:49,716
- Hi!
- How did you make out?

653
01:01:49,795 --> 01:01:52,195
A few more hands
and your father would break me.

654
01:01:52,264 --> 01:01:54,255
Well, don't say I didn't warn you.

655
01:01:54,332 --> 01:01:57,392
That's all right.
I'll get even tomorrow night.

656
01:01:57,969 --> 01:02:00,961
Now, that's one thing
I don't understand about men.

657
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:02,233
What's that?

658
01:02:02,307 --> 01:02:05,902
Well, you work hard all year and
do nothing but talk about your vacation.

659
01:02:05,977 --> 01:02:09,071
Then, when it comes,
you sit indoors and play cards.

660
01:02:09,147 --> 01:02:11,843
Yeah. It doesn't figure, does it?

661
01:02:11,917 --> 01:02:14,112
A lot of things don't figure.

662
01:02:14,519 --> 01:02:16,214
Like for instance?

663
01:02:16,288 --> 01:02:19,849
Well, for instance, what you do all year?

664
01:02:22,561 --> 01:02:24,552
I save up to play cards.

665
01:02:27,632 --> 01:02:31,124
I guess I should have brought along a deck
of cards instead of a swimming suit.

666
01:02:31,203 --> 01:02:34,297
I'd say you did the right thing.

667
01:02:34,372 --> 01:02:36,101
You can swim too?

668
01:02:36,174 --> 01:02:38,039
Like you play cards.

669
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:40,738
I'll tell you what. I'll meet you
at the pool tomorrow morning.

670
01:02:40,812 --> 01:02:44,043
- You teach me and I'll teach you.
- That's a deal.

671
01:03:09,908 --> 01:03:11,205
Thanks.

672
01:04:02,928 --> 01:04:05,089
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

673
01:04:06,097 --> 01:04:08,588
Do you always bring a book along
when you have a date?

674
01:04:08,667 --> 01:04:10,965
Well, it depends on the date.

675
01:04:11,403 --> 01:04:12,734
Let's see.

676
01:04:13,705 --> 01:04:17,436
<i>Civil Code of the State of Missouri,</i>
<i>Rules and Procedure?</i>

677
01:04:18,543 --> 01:04:21,706
- Translation?
- I'm cramming for the bar exams.

678
01:04:22,547 --> 01:04:24,276
No cracks, please.

679
01:04:27,419 --> 01:04:31,116
Don't tell me you're opposed
to the higher education of the female?

680
01:04:31,189 --> 01:04:35,489
No, it's just that you don't look like
a lawyer to me.

681
01:04:36,761 --> 01:04:39,787
Well, I've found that people rarely look
like what they are.

682
01:04:39,865 --> 01:04:42,231
Now, take yourself, for instance.

683
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:46,100
To look at you, I'd say
you were probably a fisherman.

684
01:04:46,171 --> 01:04:50,301
Instead, you're probably a salesman?

685
01:04:51,610 --> 01:04:53,168
Would you like it if I were a salesman?

686
01:04:53,245 --> 01:04:57,909
Now, look, I'm the one that's supposed
to get the answers by cross-examination.

687
01:04:57,983 --> 01:05:02,477
I've always heard that the best witnesses
are the ones who want to answer.

688
01:05:03,388 --> 01:05:05,322
Thanks for the advice.

689
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:07,881
I got some more for you, and for free, too.

690
01:05:07,959 --> 01:05:12,658
Always arrange to have your cases
tried in front of all-male juries.

691
01:05:12,731 --> 01:05:14,528
You can't lose, kid.

692
01:05:15,734 --> 01:05:17,929
Hey, you're beginning to sound
promising again.

693
01:05:26,478 --> 01:05:29,936
I left my cigarettes up at the cabin.
I'll be right back.

694
01:05:34,653 --> 01:05:36,086
Mr. Harris.

695
01:05:37,489 --> 01:05:38,888
Milkman?

696
01:05:40,191 --> 01:05:41,624
Iceman?

697
01:06:16,094 --> 01:06:17,925
Good morning, Mr. Foster.

698
01:06:17,996 --> 01:06:20,760
Hello. How about some cards tonight?

699
01:06:20,832 --> 01:06:23,596
I can't. I got a dinner date with a lawyer.

700
01:06:23,668 --> 01:06:26,228
She may never get to be one
if she's kept from her studies.

701
01:06:26,304 --> 01:06:28,067
Well, she has to eat sometime.

702
01:06:28,139 --> 01:06:30,073
- Why don't you join us?
- I'd like to.

703
01:06:30,141 --> 01:06:32,109
Good. I'll see you then.

704
01:07:40,712 --> 01:07:42,009
Get up.

705
01:07:43,048 --> 01:07:45,209
You hear what he said, palsie?

706
01:07:46,384 --> 01:07:48,409
Smart boy didn't hear you.

707
01:07:53,024 --> 01:07:55,993
What's the matter, palsie,
your ears stuffed?

708
01:08:01,666 --> 01:08:03,691
I think he hears you now.

709
01:08:04,702 --> 01:08:05,862
See?

710
01:08:16,581 --> 01:08:18,276
He's cooperating.

711
01:08:19,417 --> 01:08:21,112
Ain't you, palsie?

712
01:08:22,754 --> 01:08:24,221
What is this?

713
01:08:24,923 --> 01:08:27,517
Smart boy, here, wants to know
what is this?

714
01:08:27,592 --> 01:08:29,321
What's your line, Mister?

715
01:08:30,628 --> 01:08:31,822
He knows.

716
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:35,428
You make me for a sucker, palsie?

717
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:36,660
I don't like that.

718
01:08:40,872 --> 01:08:42,305
You're crazy.

719
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:50,939
I'll pinpoint it for you, chum.

720
01:08:51,749 --> 01:08:54,980
Pete Harris and me did
a deuce together at Joliet.

721
01:08:56,754 --> 01:08:58,517
That makes you a phony.

722
01:08:59,557 --> 01:09:02,856
And now we're going to take
a nice quiet walk.

723
01:09:02,927 --> 01:09:07,455
And when we get to the right place
you're gonna tell us the story of your life.

724
01:09:07,532 --> 01:09:08,965
I don't move.

725
01:09:10,068 --> 01:09:13,697
Yeah, make a noise.
Bring the cops in on you.

726
01:09:14,405 --> 01:09:16,635
Smart boy wants it done quiet.

727
01:09:25,884 --> 01:09:27,215
Come in.

728
01:09:31,656 --> 01:09:34,056
Pardon me. I didn't know you had visitors.

729
01:09:34,125 --> 01:09:36,320
That's all right. Come on in.

730
01:09:38,196 --> 01:09:40,630
Miss Foster, you know Mr. Romano?

731
01:09:41,166 --> 01:09:42,463
Mr. Kane.

732
01:09:42,534 --> 01:09:45,298
I've seen Mr. Romano around.
How do you do, Mr. Kane?

733
01:09:45,370 --> 01:09:46,564
Hello.

734
01:09:47,405 --> 01:09:50,841
They were trying to talk me
into taking a walk with them.

735
01:09:50,909 --> 01:09:52,206
I explained we had a date.

736
01:09:52,277 --> 01:09:55,246
- I don't mind.
- I told them you wouldn't.

737
01:09:56,214 --> 01:09:58,273
Just a couple of nature-lovers.

738
01:09:58,349 --> 01:10:01,216
We were chatting about it
when you knocked.

739
01:10:01,653 --> 01:10:05,384
Well, it must have been
a very warm discussion.

740
01:10:07,759 --> 01:10:10,956
I just dropped in to return this to you.

741
01:10:11,029 --> 01:10:12,257
Thanks.

742
01:10:13,498 --> 01:10:15,261
I hardly missed it.

743
01:10:16,334 --> 01:10:18,802
I only carry it in case of snakes.

744
01:10:21,139 --> 01:10:22,538
We'll be seeing you, Harris.

745
01:10:23,274 --> 01:10:24,400
Yeah.

746
01:10:27,645 --> 01:10:32,480
Hey, Tony, I know a sure cure
for a nose-bleed.

747
01:10:33,084 --> 01:10:35,780
A cold knife in the middle of the back!

748
01:10:43,761 --> 01:10:46,821
Nice guys, playful.

749
01:10:50,602 --> 01:10:53,730
Don't bother making up any stories for me.

750
01:10:53,805 --> 01:10:57,400
I thought the law said a man
was innocent until proven guilty.

751
01:10:57,475 --> 01:10:59,238
That's right.

752
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:01,938
Considering the circumstantial evidence,

753
01:11:02,013 --> 01:11:05,312
if you were my attorney,
how would you advise me to answer?

754
01:11:05,383 --> 01:11:09,513
I'd tell you not to answer at all,
unless you could answer honestly.

755
01:11:10,154 --> 01:11:12,145
It might incriminate you.

756
01:11:13,324 --> 01:11:16,054
Now you're giving me some good advice.

757
01:11:16,127 --> 01:11:17,355
Thanks.

758
01:11:18,363 --> 01:11:19,921
And for free.

759
01:13:52,049 --> 01:13:54,517
<i>Señor</i> Kane, I have been looking for you.

760
01:13:54,585 --> 01:13:56,553
I have a letter for you.

761
01:13:56,921 --> 01:13:59,253
She smells like a business one.

762
01:14:12,770 --> 01:14:15,637
<i>Buenos tardes,</i> my customers,
<i>buenos tardes.</i>

763
01:14:16,207 --> 01:14:19,040
<i>Señor</i> Romano, a letter for you.

764
01:14:20,178 --> 01:14:23,443
This one...
She also smells like a business one.

765
01:14:29,253 --> 01:14:31,050
A letter for you, <i>Señor</i> Harris.

766
01:14:31,255 --> 01:14:33,280
- Thanks.
- You're very welcome.

767
01:14:33,357 --> 01:14:34,688
Excuse me.

768
01:14:45,536 --> 01:14:47,094
Mail from home.

769
01:14:48,105 --> 01:14:49,504
It'll wait.

770
01:14:50,641 --> 01:14:53,667
I expect you to get in
some solid study tonight.

771
01:14:53,744 --> 01:14:56,076
Well, isn't that nice of you.

772
01:14:56,147 --> 01:14:57,580
How's that, Mr. Foster?

773
01:14:57,648 --> 01:14:59,582
Thanks for that and the dinner.

774
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:03,586
Don't forget.
I may ask questions tomorrow.

775
01:15:03,654 --> 01:15:05,121
Well, I'll look forward to it.

776
01:15:06,290 --> 01:15:07,655
Good night.

777
01:15:10,728 --> 01:15:13,993
Tony, you're not even looking at
how pretty they are.

778
01:15:14,065 --> 01:15:16,829
And only 11 American dollars.

779
01:15:16,901 --> 01:15:19,802
Everything around here is 11 bucks.

780
01:15:19,871 --> 01:15:22,567
Tony, you like?

781
01:15:23,875 --> 01:15:25,240
Charge it with the rest.

782
01:15:26,410 --> 01:15:28,844
- Tony?
- See you later.

783
01:15:34,151 --> 01:15:38,281
- I see you got your invitation, Tony.
- Yeah.

784
01:15:39,657 --> 01:15:41,989
How about your friend out there?

785
01:15:42,426 --> 01:15:43,984
He get his too?

786
01:15:44,896 --> 01:15:46,557
Let's go ask him.

787
01:15:57,475 --> 01:16:01,707
Pumpkin, it isn't often
I butt into your affairs,

788
01:16:01,779 --> 01:16:04,873
but I'm gonna make like a father.

789
01:16:04,949 --> 01:16:06,314
You sound serious.

790
01:16:06,384 --> 01:16:08,511
Where you're concerned
I'm always serious.

791
01:16:09,086 --> 01:16:11,520
I want you to forget that fellow.

792
01:16:12,757 --> 01:16:15,385
But you don't know anything
about him, Dad.

793
01:16:15,459 --> 01:16:16,983
Neither do you.

794
01:16:28,039 --> 01:16:29,666
Right in there...

795
01:16:43,888 --> 01:16:47,255
- Drop the gun in the well, Kane.
- Do as he tells you.

796
01:16:50,928 --> 01:16:52,555
In the well.

797
01:16:54,465 --> 01:16:57,992
- Do it!
- The gun, Kane.

798
01:16:58,069 --> 01:16:59,661
Don't! Don't!

799
01:17:01,072 --> 01:17:02,664
Go on. Drop it!

800
01:17:03,741 --> 01:17:05,106
Drop it.

801
01:17:11,182 --> 01:17:12,706
Don't shoot!

802
01:17:13,684 --> 01:17:15,117
Drop it. In the well.

803
01:17:15,186 --> 01:17:17,051
Do what he tells you.

804
01:17:17,855 --> 01:17:20,153
- Don't shoot!
- In the well.

805
01:17:20,224 --> 01:17:23,091
Do it. Get rid of it.

806
01:17:30,334 --> 01:17:34,498
All right, you two knuckle-heads,
now you're gonna listen to me,

807
01:17:34,572 --> 01:17:37,507
unless you want to join the guns
in the well.

808
01:17:37,575 --> 01:17:41,944
I got my invitation to the party.
I take Pete Harris' share.

809
01:17:42,013 --> 01:17:44,538
You gave Harris the double-shuffle.

810
01:17:44,615 --> 01:17:46,173
You got it wrong, pal.

811
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:49,913
The cops paid him off in full,
like gambling.

812
01:17:49,987 --> 01:17:54,083
A man puts up his bet.
He's entitled to be paid off if he wins.

813
01:17:54,525 --> 01:17:55,992
Harris lost.

814
01:17:56,661 --> 01:17:58,288
What did you put up?

815
01:17:58,796 --> 01:18:02,163
A possible 20 years in stir.

816
01:18:02,233 --> 01:18:04,326
You're looking at the guy
who was framed for the job.

817
01:18:04,402 --> 01:18:07,132
That's why I'm cutting myself in
whether you like it or not.

818
01:18:07,204 --> 01:18:10,662
You're smart, you'll play along with me.

819
01:18:10,741 --> 01:18:14,177
You're not, it goes rough on everybody.

820
01:18:16,013 --> 01:18:21,508
You talk awfully green for a smart guy.
What happens when Mr. Big sees you?

821
01:18:22,486 --> 01:18:24,954
Let's wait till we get to that, huh?

822
01:18:25,022 --> 01:18:31,120
Now you two boys make like friends.
Go to sleep. Go on!

823
01:18:34,331 --> 01:18:39,598
And in case you get any ideas
about visiting me later, forget it.

824
01:18:40,471 --> 01:18:41,995
I sleep light.

825
01:19:21,779 --> 01:19:23,212
What are you doing here?

826
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:26,078
Simple. I came looking for you.

827
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:27,742
It's a matter of principle, Mr. Harris.

828
01:19:27,818 --> 01:19:31,811
I just don't like anybody running out on me
twice in the same day.

829
01:19:31,889 --> 01:19:34,289
I see. Well, you see, after I got the letter...

830
01:19:34,358 --> 01:19:37,191
I told you, you didn't have make up
any stories for me.

831
01:19:37,595 --> 01:19:39,460
That's right, you did.

832
01:19:40,798 --> 01:19:44,529
Look, Pete, I know I may be butting
into something I shouldn't,

833
01:19:44,602 --> 01:19:47,162
but that's the way I am.

834
01:19:47,238 --> 01:19:50,833
Even when I was a kid,
I was always the one asking questions.

835
01:19:51,942 --> 01:19:54,877
I bet you even cross-examined
your nurse, huh?

836
01:19:54,945 --> 01:19:58,608
You know, if I were smart, I'd find myself
another date and forget all about you.

837
01:19:59,383 --> 01:20:02,352
Only I can't help feeling you're in trouble.

838
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:06,553
I liked it better this afternoon
when you stopped asking questions.

839
01:20:07,458 --> 01:20:09,722
I'm no fool, Pete.

840
01:20:09,794 --> 01:20:13,958
I've been around cops long enough
to pick up a few tricks of the trade.

841
01:20:14,031 --> 01:20:16,932
Those playmates of yours
are pretty obvious.

842
01:20:17,802 --> 01:20:19,497
What have they got on you?

843
01:20:19,570 --> 01:20:21,800
One question at a time.

844
01:20:21,872 --> 01:20:23,840
This specialty in cops.
Where did you pick that up?

845
01:20:23,908 --> 01:20:26,433
Well, my father
is a retired captain of police.

846
01:20:27,011 --> 01:20:29,946
I see. That explains your being a lawyer.

847
01:20:30,014 --> 01:20:31,743
Papa nails them and you free them.
Is that it?

848
01:20:31,816 --> 01:20:33,613
- What's that got to do with it?
- Look, you're a nice girl,

849
01:20:33,684 --> 01:20:35,743
but in case you're thinking
of mothering me, forget it.

850
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:39,085
I'm no stray dog you can pick up
and I like my neck without a collar.

851
01:20:39,156 --> 01:20:40,623
Now get lost!

852
01:20:43,594 --> 01:20:48,827
Now I'm supposed to be hurt,
maybe even cry, but I won't.

853
01:20:48,899 --> 01:20:51,094
I think you're in trouble
and I'm going to help you.

854
01:20:51,168 --> 01:20:55,730
Listen, sister, forget it.
Mind your own business.

855
01:21:21,265 --> 01:21:23,165
...then you move in.

856
01:21:23,234 --> 01:21:26,965
- You got it now, Scott?
<i>- Yeah, let me check back.</i>

857
01:21:27,271 --> 01:21:30,365
They meet out on the boat tomorrow
at dawn for the split.

858
01:21:30,441 --> 01:21:34,104
I wait out on the police boat
for your light signal, then I move in.

859
01:21:34,678 --> 01:21:38,114
- And you answer my signal first.
<i>- Right.</i>

860
01:21:38,182 --> 01:21:39,911
- Scott.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

861
01:21:39,984 --> 01:21:41,008
Don't miss.

862
01:21:41,085 --> 01:21:45,522
- Don't worry. I won't.
<i>- Good luck.</i>

863
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:41,170
Well, pumpkin,
I thought you'd be asleep by this time.

864
01:22:41,245 --> 01:22:43,543
I've been waiting for you, Dad.

865
01:22:46,617 --> 01:22:49,643
- Got a little problem?
- Yeah.

866
01:22:50,354 --> 01:22:52,845
You used to have them pretty often
when you were younger.

867
01:22:52,923 --> 01:22:56,017
I always knew
when something was troubling you.

868
01:22:56,493 --> 01:22:58,552
Matter of fact, I kind of miss it.

869
01:22:58,629 --> 01:23:01,097
Were they very tough problems
I used to bring to you, Dad?

870
01:23:01,699 --> 01:23:05,760
Very tough. Some new trinkets
you wanted and money for the movies.

871
01:23:05,836 --> 01:23:07,394
That time you got into your first formal

872
01:23:07,471 --> 01:23:10,338
and your beau came down
with the measles.

873
01:23:10,407 --> 01:23:11,931
That was a tough one.

874
01:23:12,009 --> 01:23:15,103
Finally had to take you out myself
that night.

875
01:23:21,185 --> 01:23:24,279
Once you even wanted to know when
we'd get you a new ma to look after you.

876
01:23:24,655 --> 01:23:26,919
That was a real tough one.

877
01:23:27,458 --> 01:23:30,518
Most of them, though,
we were able to work out.

878
01:23:32,796 --> 01:23:35,890
You were right about Harris, Dad.
He's in a jam.

879
01:23:38,669 --> 01:23:42,537
I forgot to tell you,
you used to take my advice.

880
01:23:42,606 --> 01:23:46,804
In those days, you wouldn't have gone
running after him if I'd asked you not to.

881
01:23:46,877 --> 01:23:51,211
I want you to help him, Dad.
That way you'll be helping me.

882
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:56,413
Why? Professional interest?

883
01:23:56,487 --> 01:24:00,321
I don't really know, Dad,
but something's happened.

884
01:24:00,557 --> 01:24:05,460
I know it sounds crazy and illogical,
but that's the way it is.

885
01:24:07,498 --> 01:24:10,467
He's out of bounds for you, Helen,
way out of bounds.

886
01:24:10,534 --> 01:24:12,161
You said that before. Why?

887
01:24:12,236 --> 01:24:14,363
- Isn't it enough that I tell you?
- Not this time.

888
01:24:14,438 --> 01:24:15,803
All right.

889
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:18,398
He's an ex-con.

890
01:24:20,077 --> 01:24:21,942
I just didn't want to hit you
over the head with it.

891
01:24:23,047 --> 01:24:24,241
What else do you know about him?

892
01:24:24,314 --> 01:24:25,941
- Isn't that enough?
- No, it's not.

893
01:24:26,016 --> 01:24:27,847
There's more. There's got to be more.

894
01:24:27,918 --> 01:24:31,547
You wouldn't be so positive
if there weren't something...

895
01:24:31,622 --> 01:24:33,487
What else have you got against him?

896
01:24:33,557 --> 01:24:35,616
You're going home tonight, young lady.

897
01:24:35,692 --> 01:24:38,388
Is that the way you solved my problems
when I was a kid?

898
01:24:38,462 --> 01:24:40,657
- This is for your own good.
- Is it?

899
01:24:40,731 --> 01:24:44,758
Believe me. Believe me, pumpkin,
go home and forget him.

900
01:24:46,103 --> 01:24:51,507
You... You can start the ball rolling
on that re-hearing, and I'll be...

901
01:24:51,575 --> 01:24:52,735
Helen?

902
01:26:53,297 --> 01:26:55,629
Good morning, palsies. Hold it.

903
01:26:56,934 --> 01:26:59,129
You'll never learn, will you?

904
01:27:16,653 --> 01:27:20,714
Good morning. Don't tell me
you boys are going fishing too?

905
01:27:20,791 --> 01:27:24,488
Yeah, we see you get such a kick out of it.
We decided to give it a try.

906
01:27:24,561 --> 01:27:25,789
Great sport.

907
01:27:25,862 --> 01:27:28,262
I'm on my way to the pier.
Can I give you a lift?

908
01:27:28,332 --> 01:27:30,562
You got yourself a passenger.

909
01:27:37,641 --> 01:27:41,941
You might as well take us all, seeing that
the three of us are going fishing.

910
01:27:42,312 --> 01:27:44,371
Did you rent a boat?

911
01:27:44,448 --> 01:27:47,849
Yeah, we got us a boat called the Mañana.

912
01:28:20,417 --> 01:28:23,750
I understand you're an ex-Captain
of Police, Mr. Foster.

913
01:28:24,321 --> 01:28:26,312
That was a long time ago.

914
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:29,518
Hey, we'll be able to match
fish stories tonight, huh?

915
01:28:29,593 --> 01:28:31,891
Sure. I'll bring pictures.

916
01:28:57,688 --> 01:28:59,121
Quite a boat.

917
01:29:01,024 --> 01:29:02,048
Yeah.

918
01:29:04,728 --> 01:29:07,196
Any kind of luck,
we all ought to do pretty good.

919
01:29:07,264 --> 01:29:08,822
Coming, Harris?

920
01:29:18,675 --> 01:29:20,040
Good luck.

921
01:29:21,845 --> 01:29:23,073
Thanks.

922
01:30:18,869 --> 01:30:20,097
Hold it.

923
01:30:47,764 --> 01:30:48,992
Freeze.

924
01:30:54,571 --> 01:30:56,869
I'll go see if he's still there.

925
01:31:02,913 --> 01:31:06,110
What's the matter, palsie?
Run out of talk?

926
01:31:12,122 --> 01:31:14,022
Not quite.

927
01:31:14,090 --> 01:31:17,218
I got a proposition.
I know where the money is.

928
01:31:18,495 --> 01:31:19,826
Right here on the boat.

929
01:31:21,031 --> 01:31:22,555
I'll show you.

930
01:31:23,467 --> 01:31:26,664
All right, look for yourself.

931
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:30,205
Right in the cupboard there.
Go ahead. Look.

932
01:31:42,486 --> 01:31:45,512
$1,200,000, Tony.

933
01:31:45,589 --> 01:31:49,923
Think of it, $1,200,000 for you and me.

934
01:31:51,628 --> 01:31:54,324
Why cut the take four ways
when we only have to cut it two?

935
01:31:55,765 --> 01:31:58,256
That's over a half a million a piece.

936
01:31:58,668 --> 01:32:00,636
Over half a million.

937
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:04,036
Why split with Kane?

938
01:32:08,311 --> 01:32:09,335
Okay, Tony...

939
01:32:27,330 --> 01:32:28,888
Why a two-way split?

940
01:32:30,934 --> 01:32:34,028
A guy living big all the time
like me needs dough.

941
01:32:35,972 --> 01:32:39,601
- So long, sucker.
- Drop it, Tony. Right in front of you.

942
01:32:41,945 --> 01:32:43,503
Kick it over here.

943
01:32:45,882 --> 01:32:48,407
Move back. Back up.

944
01:32:52,022 --> 01:32:53,887
- I don't get it.
- You will.

945
01:32:53,957 --> 01:32:56,858
Let's just take it easy
till the police get here.

946
01:32:59,262 --> 01:33:01,822
A little falling out over the split?

947
01:33:01,898 --> 01:33:05,356
- You get around a lot for a fisherman.
- Part of my job.

948
01:33:05,435 --> 01:33:06,732
Ex-cop.

949
01:33:07,370 --> 01:33:08,962
Making out like he knows from nothing.

950
01:33:09,039 --> 01:33:12,065
All depends on
what the assignment calls for.

951
01:33:12,142 --> 01:33:14,804
You never had a chance.
We had the big guy from the beginning.

952
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:20,343
Don't let that bother you, Tony.
It was all marked anyway.

953
01:33:20,717 --> 01:33:24,153
We should have figured that.
- That's right, Joe.

954
01:33:26,456 --> 01:33:28,219
The name is Pete.

955
01:33:29,292 --> 01:33:31,920
Like in Pete Harris who was shot
and killed in Tijuana?

956
01:33:38,501 --> 01:33:40,935
Something bothering you, Joe?

957
01:33:41,338 --> 01:33:42,737
Yeah.

958
01:33:43,006 --> 01:33:45,338
The only person who would know
Pete Harris was in Tijuana

959
01:33:45,408 --> 01:33:49,572
would be the one who sent him there
to hide out and wait for a wire.

960
01:33:51,848 --> 01:33:54,112
You're a boy with a lot of ideas.

961
01:33:54,184 --> 01:33:58,245
Sure, like only a cop would know
you couldn't use $1,200,000 in hot cash,

962
01:33:58,321 --> 01:34:01,586
but you could trade it in
for a nice clean reward.

963
01:34:02,325 --> 01:34:03,815
Got it all figured out?

964
01:34:05,328 --> 01:34:08,889
Three little patsies, one down, two to go.

965
01:34:08,965 --> 01:34:12,298
Your being there to give us a lift,
the money on a platter,

966
01:34:12,369 --> 01:34:14,667
honey for the bees, huh, Captain Foster?

967
01:34:14,738 --> 01:34:17,104
- Stay where you are!
- Sure, sure.

968
01:34:17,941 --> 01:34:22,310
We'll wait till the cops arrive,
try my story on for size.

969
01:34:22,779 --> 01:34:25,805
If I'm wrong I'll apologize.

970
01:35:32,248 --> 01:35:33,772
Forget it.

971
01:35:34,918 --> 01:35:37,386
My luck had to give out some time.

972
01:35:40,156 --> 01:35:44,957
I wouldn't mind so much, Joe,
if Helen didn't have to find out.

973
01:35:52,569 --> 01:35:56,403
You're not part of this.
You've got a break coming.

974
01:36:03,046 --> 01:36:05,606
Tim? What's happened? Are you hurt?

975
01:36:06,049 --> 01:36:08,017
What's Rolfe doing here?

976
01:36:08,885 --> 01:36:12,548
I've been saving him, surprise for you.

977
01:36:13,890 --> 01:36:16,222
It was his lead turned the trick.

978
01:36:17,894 --> 01:36:22,524
Only it didn't come off the way
we planned it. Did it, Joe?

979
01:36:29,305 --> 01:36:30,499
No.

980
01:36:31,908 --> 01:36:33,466
No, it didn't.

981
01:36:40,617 --> 01:36:44,815
Third guy was Pete Harris,
burned down in Tijuana.

982
01:36:46,156 --> 01:36:50,889
Scott, if anybody deserves a reward,

983
01:36:52,262 --> 01:36:53,695
it's him.

984
01:36:54,297 --> 01:36:56,390
Let's get him to a doctor.

985
01:36:56,499 --> 01:37:00,458
No. Give her my love, Joe.

986
01:37:01,538 --> 01:37:02,971
Thanks.

987
01:37:19,656 --> 01:37:22,318
I know it's just talk now, Helen,

988
01:37:22,392 --> 01:37:26,488
but I feel the loss of your father
as keenly as you do.

989
01:37:26,563 --> 01:37:28,929
I owe him a lot for what he did.

990
01:37:28,998 --> 01:37:32,957
And if there's anything that you ever need,
will you call on me?

991
01:37:34,370 --> 01:37:36,133
Thanks, Mr. Andrews.

992
01:37:36,973 --> 01:37:41,069
And one other thing about Joe Rolfe.

993
01:37:41,144 --> 01:37:43,009
He's a fine boy.

994
01:37:43,079 --> 01:37:47,675
That scrape he got into a long time ago,
he's more than made up for it.

995
01:37:48,051 --> 01:37:52,044
And the way I feel, my company
will underwrite him anytime.

996
01:37:53,389 --> 01:37:56,017
I tried so hard to make Dad understand.

997
01:37:56,392 --> 01:37:57,882
You did, Helen.

998
01:37:57,961 --> 01:38:01,556
The last thing he said was for Joe
to give you his love.

999
01:38:11,941 --> 01:38:13,704
How's she taking it, Mr. Andrews?

1000
01:38:13,776 --> 01:38:17,405
Pretty good, Joe, she's had time
to get over the shock.

1001
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:20,813
But a hero's medal isn't enough
when you're alone.

1002
01:38:20,884 --> 01:38:23,352
She and her dad were pretty close.

1003
01:38:23,553 --> 01:38:26,147
- I told her about you.

1004
01:38:26,222 --> 01:38:28,087
Why don't you ask her?
