1
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:12,814
Arretez au coin, s'il vous plait.

2
00:02:37,414 --> 00:02:39,774
- Monsieur FoinÃ©.
- Yes, monsieur?

3
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:42,434
Could I speak to you for a moment?

4
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:48,414
Well, I've been studying painting
with you for some time now.

5
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:52,151
- Do you think it's worth my while
to go on? - Why do you ask?

6
00:02:52,186 --> 00:02:55,619
There's no sense in staying
unless I have talent.

7
00:02:55,654 --> 00:02:59,494
If you are not certain about
your talent, why stay till now?

8
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:02,731
Because all this is so...
so beautiful to me.

9
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:06,149
In my youth,
it was also beautiful to me.

10
00:03:06,184 --> 00:03:09,939
But now, it is the
city of lost illusions.

11
00:03:09,974 --> 00:03:13,159
- Is your studio very far?
- No. Not very.

12
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:18,014
- Let us go there. You will show
me what you have done. - Yes.

13
00:03:25,174 --> 00:03:29,374
- Have you any money?
- A little. Not enough to live on.

14
00:03:35,534 --> 00:03:37,579
Then, I must tell you.

15
00:03:37,614 --> 00:03:42,214
There is no talent here.
Merely industry and intelligence.

16
00:03:42,215 --> 00:03:44,715
You will never be anything but mediocre.

17
00:03:44,749 --> 00:03:49,914
And it is very cruel to discover one's
mediocrity only when it is too late.

18
00:03:50,915 --> 00:03:53,015
I know.

19
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:57,414
Do you see that?
That name does not belong there.

20
00:03:57,449 --> 00:03:59,939
It belongs somewhere else.

21
00:03:59,974 --> 00:04:04,974
Take your courage in both your hands
and make something of your life.

22
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:16,653
- Have you anything in mind?
- Well, you see...

23
00:04:18,054 --> 00:04:20,574
<i>I have my limitations.</i>

24
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:23,775
<i>My father was a doctor, I've always
been interested in medicine.</i>

25
00:04:23,809 --> 00:04:28,494
If one can't be great, at least
one can be of some use to people.

26
00:05:15,594 --> 00:05:19,234
I don't know why I should 'ave such
a thing. Upon my word, I don't!

27
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:23,919
I've never had a day's illness in my
life, you only got to look at me.

28
00:05:23,954 --> 00:05:27,359
It's a winter cough.
Many middle-aged women have it.

29
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:30,394
Well, I never! That's an
harsh thing to say to a lady!

30
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:32,995
No-one's ever called me
middle-aged before.

31
00:05:32,996 --> 00:05:34,396
It's time you got used to it.

32
00:05:34,429 --> 00:05:37,439
All the same.
You're a nice one, deerie.

33
00:05:37,474 --> 00:05:41,053
I can't say the same to you.
Good day, madam.

34
00:05:41,088 --> 00:05:44,633
The rest of you come back tomorrow.
Get him ready.

35
00:05:44,668 --> 00:05:46,634
All right, sir.

36
00:05:51,073 --> 00:05:53,794
- Are you the boy's father?
- Yes, sir.

37
00:05:55,674 --> 00:05:58,239
What's the matter with you now?

38
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:02,554
You see what the matter is.
The boy has a club foot.

39
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,318
Carey, you'd better take this case.

40
00:06:05,353 --> 00:06:09,593
It's a subject you ought
to know something about.

41
00:06:16,874 --> 00:06:21,414
It's only for the looks of the
thing. I don't find it no trouble.

42
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:26,154
- That's wonderful. I always did.
- That's cos you let them go on at you.

43
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:29,979
You're a little slow, Carey.
I'll instruct the class.

44
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:34,974
There are many varieties of
club feet. This is less interesting.

45
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:39,934
<i>Yours would prove more interesting.
You have Talepis Equinus, haven't you?</i>

46
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:44,034
- Yes. I believe so.
- Mind taking off your sock, Carey?

47
00:06:47,434 --> 00:06:49,474
No. Not at all.

48
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:07,714
Keeps his feet nice and clean,
doesn't he?

49
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:12,934
<i>Hm, yes. Just as I thought.
Talipes equinus.</i>

50
00:07:13,535 --> 00:07:16,335
<i>Malformation requiring you to walk
on the outside of the foot.</i>

51
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:19,754
A very interesting example,
I must say!

52
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:22,154
Do you mind if I have a look?

53
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:24,199
Congenital club foot.

54
00:07:24,234 --> 00:07:28,794
<i>In simple language, a foot twisted
inward. The cause is not clear.</i>

55
00:07:28,829 --> 00:07:31,158
<i>Hereditary influence plays a part.</i>

56
00:07:31,193 --> 00:07:35,154
<i>Dr Little traces recurring deformity
through four generations.</i>

57
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:37,633
When you've quite finished...

58
00:07:41,054 --> 00:07:43,614
I say, old man, I like that!

59
00:07:44,015 --> 00:07:47,315
- French, isn't she?
- Yes. She was a model in Paris.

60
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:51,251
I can't, for the life of me,
understand why you gave up painting.

61
00:07:51,286 --> 00:07:55,600
I'd rather look at that all day
long, than at this!

62
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:58,901
Woman, you know!
You can tell'em by the, er, pelvis.

63
00:07:59,335 --> 00:08:01,714
I like 'em with a little more...

64
00:08:05,534 --> 00:08:08,994
There's life in the old girl yet!
Don't inhale, deerie!

65
00:08:09,034 --> 00:08:12,079
I say! I've got to be getting along!

66
00:08:12,114 --> 00:08:14,974
A little matter of a barmaid
at the Crown & Anchor.

67
00:08:14,975 --> 00:08:18,375
And very nice, too!
Cheerie-o!

68
00:08:18,409 --> 00:08:20,279
Funny fellow, isn't he?

69
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:24,893
- It must have been wonderful
having that life in Paris - It was.

70
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:29,438
- You really knew all those
fascinating women? - Some of them.

71
00:08:29,473 --> 00:08:33,333
- I wonder if you couldn't help me.
- In what way?

72
00:08:33,368 --> 00:08:36,859
There's a girl
and I can't get anywhere with her.

73
00:08:36,894 --> 00:08:41,814
You've been to Paris and all that.
I'm sure you can give me a starter.

74
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:46,834
I'd ask Griffiths, only he couldn't
remember whom he was doing it for.

75
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:50,314
You know, say something
to make her laugh.

76
00:08:54,194 --> 00:08:58,014
What? You don't believe it?
You are too suspicious!

77
00:09:08,153 --> 00:09:12,894
- I say, she's marvellous, isn't she?
- No. She's anaemic.

78
00:09:22,914 --> 00:09:26,794
- You don't suppose she likes him?
- Of course.

79
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:30,514
Now's your chance.
Say something.

80
00:09:33,034 --> 00:09:34,994
Well, I see your friend's going.

81
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:37,359
I don't know what you mean.

82
00:09:37,394 --> 00:09:40,954
The nobleman
with the sandy moustache.

83
00:09:40,989 --> 00:09:43,954
Has he left you for another?

84
00:09:45,274 --> 00:09:49,474
Some people would do better
to mind their own business.

85
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:50,834
Why?

86
00:09:54,454 --> 00:09:57,994
You have a very nice back. Am I
on speaking terms with your back?

87
00:09:58,029 --> 00:10:02,194
Woman, you know.
You can tell by the pelvis.

88
00:10:02,229 --> 00:10:07,199
And that... calls himself
a gentleman!

89
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:09,134
I apologise.

90
00:10:09,135 --> 00:10:11,835
- What for?
- I promised you something charming.

91
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:15,479
She's turned out to be
ill-natured and contemptible.

92
00:10:15,514 --> 00:10:19,554
You don't suppose I care what
an anaemic waitress says to me?

93
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:23,514
Well, I do. I must be going.

94
00:10:23,549 --> 00:10:25,399
Coming along?

95
00:10:25,434 --> 00:10:28,754
No, I think I'll have some more tea.

96
00:10:54,934 --> 00:10:57,959
- Anything you want?
- Yes, if you don't mind.

97
00:10:57,994 --> 00:11:02,954
I'd like to talk to you.
Filthy weather, isn't it?

98
00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:07,014
Makes no difference to me.
I have to be here all day.

99
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:10,499
Don't talk like that, I only wanted
to say something pleasant.

100
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Well, say it.

101
00:11:12,534 --> 00:11:16,774
You know, you have a lovely smile.
You should use it more often.

102
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,979
Now, don't go spoofing me.

103
00:11:19,014 --> 00:11:24,334
A girl that works hard all day
don't have much reason to smile.

104
00:11:24,369 --> 00:11:28,431
Perhaps I could find a reason.
Will you let me try?

105
00:11:29,266 --> 00:11:32,494
I don't know whether I will
or whether I won't.

106
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:34,934
I hope you'll decide you will.

107
00:11:51,414 --> 00:11:53,214
Huh!

108
00:12:44,614 --> 00:12:48,253
Like that, unt that, like so!

109
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:19,294
That is a nice little hand.

110
00:13:29,714 --> 00:13:32,114
- Excuse me, won't you?
- Ja ja.

111
00:13:35,854 --> 00:13:38,994
- How do you do?
- You seem in a great hurry.

112
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:41,594
I've been waiting ten minutes.

113
00:13:43,594 --> 00:13:46,334
- I didn't know you could draw!
- Didn't you?

114
00:13:46,634 --> 00:13:49,754
- That meant to be me?
- Looks like you, doesn't it?

115
00:13:50,774 --> 00:13:53,594
If you look at it that way.
Tea?

116
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:57,594
You are a strange sort.

117
00:13:58,814 --> 00:14:03,334
I say, will you dine with me
some time? We'll go to the theatre?

118
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:06,319
- I don't mind.
- When will you come?

119
00:14:06,354 --> 00:14:09,474
- I'm off Thursdays.
- All right, Thursday.

120
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:12,575
Seven o'clock Victoria Station?

121
00:14:16,094 --> 00:14:21,374
All right. I'll meet you at Victoria
in the second class waiting room.

122
00:14:25,794 --> 00:14:27,454
<i>All tickets, please!</i>

123
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:29,414
<i>Show your tickets.</i>

124
00:14:29,814 --> 00:14:31,594
<i>All tickets, please!</i>

125
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:36,594
<i>All tickets, please!</i>

126
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:39,434
<i>Show your tickets.
All tickets, please!</i>

127
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:43,494
<i>Boat train, platform 19!</i>

128
00:14:44,394 --> 00:14:48,074
<i>All tickets, please!
Show your tickets.</i>

129
00:15:18,014 --> 00:15:21,634
- I thought you were never coming.
- I like that! After keeping me waiting.

130
00:15:21,635 --> 00:15:23,295
I almost went home.

131
00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:26,534
I was in the second class waiting room.
I thought you said you'd be there.

132
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:31,454
Is it likely I'd sit in the second
class when I could sit in the first?

133
00:15:31,854 --> 00:15:35,534
For a gentleman of brains,
you don't use 'em, do you?

134
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:39,234
Perhaps not. Anyway, you're here,
so it's all right, isn't it?

135
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:42,234
You certainly do make a girl
feel important to you.

136
00:15:45,554 --> 00:15:47,694
I love that music.

137
00:15:49,474 --> 00:15:52,314
Whenever I hear it, I think of you.

138
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,119
How pale you are.

139
00:15:57,154 --> 00:15:59,914
How strange, how cold.

140
00:16:03,994 --> 00:16:08,353
You are going it!
Do you always order champagne?

141
00:16:09,854 --> 00:16:12,634
- No.
- Why did you do it now?

142
00:16:16,034 --> 00:16:19,534
I was hoping it would make you...
more friendly.

143
00:16:21,534 --> 00:16:24,174
- Do you think it will?
- Well...

144
00:16:24,175 --> 00:16:27,204
there's one thing
I can say for you.

145
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:30,234
Gentleman,
in every sense of the word.

146
00:16:57,014 --> 00:17:00,639
- May I see you again?
- I don't mind.

147
00:17:00,974 --> 00:17:03,414
Doesn't it make
any difference to you?

148
00:17:03,474 --> 00:17:08,674
No. If you don't take me out,
someone else will.

149
00:17:32,674 --> 00:17:34,879
I'll say good night here.

150
00:17:34,914 --> 00:17:38,154
- Won't you stay for a moment?
- No. - Why not?

151
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:41,394
People would think
I don't know what.

152
00:18:40,674 --> 00:18:42,498
I love that music.

153
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:45,593
Whenever I hear it, I...
I think of you.

154
00:18:45,628 --> 00:18:48,954
Whenever I hear it...
I think of us.

155
00:19:21,214 --> 00:19:25,834
I've never danced with anyone...
who danced like you.

156
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:31,213
I've been looking for you...
all my life.

157
00:19:50,134 --> 00:19:52,674
You don't have much to
do with your time.

158
00:19:52,675 --> 00:19:54,275
I should be studying.

159
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:57,439
- Then why don't you?-
Well, I'd rather see you.

160
00:19:58,374 --> 00:20:00,494
Any of the girls noticed
you're waiting for me?

161
00:20:00,495 --> 00:20:02,875
I don't know. Why, what
difference does it make?

162
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:07,076
- They all laugh at you.
- Do they? Why?

163
00:20:07,077 --> 00:20:09,337
Say you're in love with me.

164
00:20:14,654 --> 00:20:16,274
May I call you Mildred?

165
00:20:16,309 --> 00:20:18,334
I don't mind.

166
00:20:19,074 --> 00:20:22,099
Look here, don't say that
any more, will you?

167
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,600
Why not?

168
00:20:23,634 --> 00:20:28,034
Well, I'll call you Mildred
and you call me Philip, will you?

169
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,319
I'll think of it.

170
00:20:31,354 --> 00:20:35,434
I, um... I'm a little
awkward at this but...

171
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:37,235
will you kiss me good night?

172
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,074
No.

173
00:20:40,214 --> 00:20:44,514
Oh, Mildred. Will you come
to the theatre with me on Saturday?

174
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:46,794
I don't mind.

175
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:58,154
<i>- You're sure they're for Saturday?
- Certainly.</i>

176
00:21:16,634 --> 00:21:20,554
My name is Miller, Emile Miller.
We should know each other.

177
00:21:20,589 --> 00:21:25,674
- Why? - Well, we are both interested
in the same thing. - Thing?

178
00:21:25,709 --> 00:21:30,274
My dear young man, you are so...
so... er...

179
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:34,079
artistic. You, you
should be more...

180
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:36,199
Like so!

181
00:21:36,334 --> 00:21:38,314
Thanks. Thanks very much.

182
00:21:38,349 --> 00:21:41,371
That's... that's all right.

183
00:21:41,406 --> 00:21:43,594
Keep the change.

184
00:21:47,834 --> 00:21:49,639
What time shall I see you?

185
00:21:49,674 --> 00:21:52,694
I forgot to tell you, Philip.
I can't go.

186
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,495
- Why not?
- Me aunt's ill.

187
00:21:58,714 --> 00:22:00,754
Oh.

188
00:22:03,434 --> 00:22:05,174
Well!

189
00:22:06,514 --> 00:22:08,473
What's the sense in that?

190
00:22:08,474 --> 00:22:11,074
You don't suppose I want
to go by myself, do you?

191
00:22:11,108 --> 00:22:16,033
- I only got them for your sake.
- Well you needn't go on about it.

192
00:22:20,614 --> 00:22:23,699
<i>Violets! Sweet violets!</i>

193
00:22:23,734 --> 00:22:26,174
<i>Sweet violets, tuppence a bunch.</i>

194
00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:30,234
<i>Violets! Sweet violets...</i>

195
00:22:35,994 --> 00:22:37,919
You're spying on me.

196
00:22:37,954 --> 00:22:41,394
I thought you was a gentleman,
in every sense of the word.

197
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:43,754
Are you going out with Miller? No.

198
00:22:46,673 --> 00:22:51,574
Well, what if I am? I can go out
with him if I want to, can't I?

199
00:22:53,593 --> 00:22:56,959
- He's keeping you waiting, isn't he?
- I'd rather wait for him

200
00:22:56,994 --> 00:22:59,834
than have you waiting for me.

201
00:23:04,114 --> 00:23:06,759
Won't you change your mind?
I'll get some more tickets...

202
00:23:06,794 --> 00:23:08,874
No.

203
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,994
You keep looking for him
the way I look for you.

204
00:23:22,514 --> 00:23:24,994
If you don't come out with me
tonight you'll never see me again.

205
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:27,714
Good riddance to bad rubbish.

206
00:23:45,374 --> 00:23:47,154
Oh, drink?

207
00:23:50,634 --> 00:23:53,114
Desire?

208
00:26:33,354 --> 00:26:35,219
Sorry, old boy.

209
00:26:35,254 --> 00:26:38,354
How about a nice large beer, huh?

210
00:26:39,353 --> 00:26:42,274
- Wouldn't help.
- What would?

211
00:27:03,294 --> 00:27:05,299
Oh, Phil. Leave it.

212
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:09,114
- Why? What for?
- Shows the waiter who you are.

213
00:27:10,794 --> 00:27:14,234
He knows who you are.

214
00:27:15,594 --> 00:27:18,994
- And so do I.
- What do you mean?

215
00:27:20,054 --> 00:27:22,499
I'm sorry. I... didn't mean.

216
00:27:22,534 --> 00:27:26,914
You're a bit too superior for me,
me fine young friend.

217
00:27:29,934 --> 00:27:31,994
Mildred!

218
00:27:36,914 --> 00:27:39,239
Of course you don't like me.
I'm a cripple.

219
00:27:39,274 --> 00:27:43,093
- No, Phil. It isn't that.
- I've felt it all along.

220
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,434
Foolish.

221
00:27:47,454 --> 00:27:49,974
Mind my hat, silly!

222
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:52,394
You are clumsy!

223
00:28:12,073 --> 00:28:14,179
You're off your nut,
you don't know what you're doing!

224
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:17,180
What practice can you
expect with a wife like that?

225
00:28:17,214 --> 00:28:21,934
- I don't know. - Let me ask you something.
Why do you want to marry this girl?

226
00:28:23,054 --> 00:28:26,534
- Because I'm so in love with her.
- Aah!

227
00:28:34,294 --> 00:28:37,494
That ring with a little design
is very popular, sir.

228
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:42,094
We sell a great many of them.
They're 30 shillings.

229
00:28:42,129 --> 00:28:44,134
Thank you, sir.

230
00:28:45,134 --> 00:28:49,914
Philip, were you surprised when
I asked you to take me to dinner?

231
00:28:49,949 --> 00:28:54,199
- I was delighted. - Were you?
- Yeah. - Why?

232
00:28:54,234 --> 00:28:58,834
You've been so sweet to me all day
and I've got something to ask you.

233
00:28:58,869 --> 00:29:03,274
- It makes it so much easier for me.
- Makes it easier for me, too.

234
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:07,694
- I've something to tell you.
- No, no. Let me tell you first.

235
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,694
There it is.

236
00:29:13,234 --> 00:29:15,279
I want you to marry me.

237
00:29:15,314 --> 00:29:19,934
I'm so sorry, Philip.
That's what I was about to tell you.

238
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:22,951
You shouldn't have waited so long.

239
00:29:22,986 --> 00:29:27,334
The fact is,
I'm going to be married.

240
00:29:30,334 --> 00:29:32,194
Are you?

241
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:33,419
To whom?

242
00:29:33,454 --> 00:29:35,459
A man I know.

243
00:29:35,494 --> 00:29:38,114
He earns very good money.

244
00:29:38,149 --> 00:29:41,299
Yes, I'm... I'm sure of it.

245
00:29:41,334 --> 00:29:45,294
Now, you won't go on about it,
will you, Philip?

246
00:29:46,294 --> 00:29:47,539
All right.

247
00:29:47,574 --> 00:29:51,819
I'm getting on.
I'm 24. Time I settled down.

248
00:29:51,854 --> 00:29:55,754
This gentleman earns Â£ 7 a week.
He's got good prospects.

249
00:29:55,789 --> 00:29:59,519
Well, this is goodbye.
I hate to eat and run, Philip.

250
00:29:59,554 --> 00:30:05,254
I'm going to the theatre with the
gentleman that I'm going to marry.

251
00:30:22,514 --> 00:30:26,354
<i>All the latest films
of the day!</i>

252
00:30:37,214 --> 00:30:39,234
Taxi.

253
00:31:43,394 --> 00:31:45,754
Have you seen her since?

254
00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:47,433
No.

255
00:31:47,434 --> 00:31:52,234
London is the largest city in the world
and you know the cure for one woman.

256
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:55,114
- Another.
- Ha ha! Right, ho!

257
00:32:05,814 --> 00:32:09,454
Norah, you don't read
such junk, do you?

258
00:32:09,954 --> 00:32:12,354
- No. I write it.
- What?

259
00:32:12,854 --> 00:32:16,379
- That's how I earn my living.
- I didn't know.

260
00:32:16,414 --> 00:32:21,054
- Successful? - Very. I have an immense
popularity amongst kitchen maids.

261
00:32:21,154 --> 00:32:23,214
They think me so refined.

262
00:32:27,534 --> 00:32:30,074
Let's not talk about that.

263
00:32:31,174 --> 00:32:33,674
Let's talk about us.

264
00:32:44,994 --> 00:32:46,954
Norah...

265
00:32:47,355 --> 00:32:50,155
Y- you're not really
fond of me, are you?

266
00:32:50,754 --> 00:32:55,133
Clever boy,
you ask such foolish questions.

267
00:32:55,168 --> 00:32:57,719
Oh, my dear. It never
struck me that it could be.

268
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,220
- Pleased?
- Delighted.

269
00:33:00,254 --> 00:33:03,074
And so proud
and so happy and so...

270
00:33:03,075 --> 00:33:04,660
So grateful.

271
00:33:04,694 --> 00:33:09,754
I wish you hadn't been in love
with... What was her name?

272
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:11,759
Mildred.

273
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:15,279
Because if she hadn't treated
you so abominably

274
00:33:15,314 --> 00:33:20,274
it wouldn't have taken you so long
to understand how I feel.

275
00:33:37,073 --> 00:33:40,633
- I saw you!
- I wasn't very quick!

276
00:33:41,794 --> 00:33:44,834
Let's go out and play.

277
00:33:45,294 --> 00:33:48,754
Not until you've passed that exam.

278
00:34:18,634 --> 00:34:21,994
Tell me, darling.
What do you get out of this?

279
00:34:22,029 --> 00:34:24,539
You'll never know.

280
00:34:24,574 --> 00:34:27,794
I'm afraid you don't get
much fun with me.

281
00:34:27,829 --> 00:34:29,838
I wish...

282
00:34:30,073 --> 00:34:34,533
If only I could take you dancing.
I know how you love it.

283
00:34:34,568 --> 00:34:38,894
Philip, it's very silly to be
so sensitive about your foot.

284
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:42,439
Other people don't think about it
as much as you.

285
00:34:42,474 --> 00:34:47,814
They notice it when they first
see you then forget about it.

286
00:34:49,574 --> 00:34:52,474
You know, I only speak of it
because I love you.

287
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:55,999
I don't want it to make you unhappy.

288
00:34:56,034 --> 00:35:01,314
Now, will you please stay here
and go on cramming for that exam?

289
00:35:13,114 --> 00:35:15,579
There's a lady to see you, sir.

290
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:19,114
I shouldn't have let her in
but she was that upset...

291
00:35:19,149 --> 00:35:21,754
Norah!

292
00:35:27,674 --> 00:35:30,674
What do you want?

293
00:35:34,314 --> 00:35:38,274
I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

294
00:35:45,014 --> 00:35:46,754
What's the matter?

295
00:35:47,534 --> 00:35:51,274
He's left me. Emile.

296
00:35:53,014 --> 00:35:55,434
Oh, has he?

297
00:35:56,374 --> 00:35:58,099
Yes.

298
00:35:59,434 --> 00:36:02,214
Cos I'm going to have a baby.

299
00:36:18,954 --> 00:36:21,114
Why don't you sit down?

300
00:36:29,714 --> 00:36:33,774
- I suppose you want him back.
- He'll never come back.

301
00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:37,279
- Why not?
- He just won't, that's all.

302
00:36:37,314 --> 00:36:40,534
You're his wife.
He has to provide for you.

303
00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:42,914
He won't give me anything.

304
00:36:47,474 --> 00:36:50,993
- Even if he did, I wouldn't take it.
- Why not?

305
00:36:51,694 --> 00:36:55,834
No matter what's happened,
I've still got me pride.

306
00:36:56,574 --> 00:36:59,434
That's something, isn't it?

307
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:02,694
Have you got any money?

308
00:37:02,794 --> 00:37:05,194
No.

309
00:37:06,134 --> 00:37:09,774
You'd better get yourself
a place to live.

310
00:37:09,809 --> 00:37:12,979
After that,
we'll see what can be done.

311
00:37:13,014 --> 00:37:17,994
Philip, you were always so good
to me. I knew I could come to you.

312
00:37:24,193 --> 00:37:28,774
Look here, Mr Miller. I like to know what
you intend to do about Mildred.

313
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:33,994
- I? What you expect me to do?
- Take care of her. You married her.

314
00:37:34,029 --> 00:37:38,313
I? I married Mildred? Ach!

315
00:37:38,348 --> 00:37:40,354
I married...

316
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:44,234
This one.

317
00:37:48,674 --> 00:37:52,114
I'd still like to know what
you intend to do about it.

318
00:37:52,149 --> 00:37:54,919
Me? I can do nothing.

319
00:37:54,954 --> 00:37:59,514
One man cannot solution the
problem of the unmarried mother.

320
00:38:06,614 --> 00:38:08,934
Why didn't you tell me?

321
00:38:10,474 --> 00:38:12,474
I just couldn't.

322
00:38:13,813 --> 00:38:16,279
Well, brace up.

323
00:38:16,314 --> 00:38:18,674
Everything will be all right.

324
00:38:37,634 --> 00:38:39,594
Philip...

325
00:38:41,174 --> 00:38:44,514
Do you still... like me?

326
00:38:48,454 --> 00:38:50,479
Really?

327
00:38:50,514 --> 00:38:53,834
Strange as it may seem,
I always have.

328
00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:56,399
I suppose I always shall.

329
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:59,934
I did everything I could
to make you love me.

330
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:03,399
I thought you were incapable
of loving anybody.

331
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:06,194
It seems horrible to think that...

332
00:39:06,195 --> 00:39:08,995
you were willing to sacrifice
everything for that man.

333
00:39:09,029 --> 00:39:11,314
I'm awfully sorry, Philip.

334
00:39:12,393 --> 00:39:15,794
I shall never forget
you wanted to marry me.

335
00:39:29,594 --> 00:39:32,154
- Philip?
- Yes?

336
00:39:34,114 --> 00:39:36,554
You've been so nice to me...

337
00:39:38,914 --> 00:39:41,354
I'll do anything you want.

338
00:39:42,994 --> 00:39:45,039
Will you? Why?

339
00:39:45,074 --> 00:39:47,514
Why, I owe it to you.

340
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:50,793
Oh. Do you?

341
00:39:55,954 --> 00:39:58,034
You're not angry.

342
00:39:58,069 --> 00:39:59,713
No.

343
00:40:04,714 --> 00:40:09,694
- Then you'll stay and have some dinner?
- Yes, if you want me to.

344
00:40:10,114 --> 00:40:14,333
Of course, Philip.
Nothing could delight me more.

345
00:40:14,568 --> 00:40:18,153
Just a moment and
I'll have everything ready.

346
00:40:51,914 --> 00:40:53,994
Come in.

347
00:40:59,074 --> 00:41:02,354
- Hello, darling.
- Norah!

348
00:41:03,444 --> 00:41:05,824
How did you happen to come?

349
00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:08,224
Just passing by.

350
00:41:09,874 --> 00:41:13,034
I wanted to rub my nose
against your door.

351
00:41:16,194 --> 00:41:19,674
Philip, why haven't I heard from you?

352
00:41:19,709 --> 00:41:22,019
I was just going to write.

353
00:41:22,054 --> 00:41:24,473
Why haven't you come to see me?

354
00:41:24,508 --> 00:41:27,354
Well, I... I've been busy.

355
00:41:29,594 --> 00:41:31,593
Why so silent?

356
00:41:32,504 --> 00:41:35,029
Well, you see...

357
00:41:36,034 --> 00:41:39,959
Norah, I've got something
strange to tell you.

358
00:41:39,994 --> 00:41:44,353
You've been so good to me,
it only makes it harder.

359
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:47,134
Philip, what's wrong?

360
00:41:47,994 --> 00:41:50,039
I'm sorry. It's just over.

361
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:53,634
You mean you don't care for me
any more?

362
00:41:53,669 --> 00:41:56,959
- I'm afraid so.
- What have I done?

363
00:41:56,994 --> 00:41:59,934
Nothing.
You've been wonderful to me.

364
00:41:59,969 --> 00:42:02,274
It's just that I...

365
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:10,354
Of course, I knew you never loved me
as much as I loved you.

366
00:42:10,389 --> 00:42:13,459
Yes, I'm afraid
that's usually the case.

367
00:42:13,494 --> 00:42:17,434
There's usually one who loves
and one who is loved.

368
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:20,359
Oh, it's always the same.

369
00:42:20,394 --> 00:42:24,914
You want a man to be nice to you,
you have to be rotten to him.

370
00:42:24,949 --> 00:42:28,154
If you treat a man honestly, you...

371
00:42:31,934 --> 00:42:35,794
Philip, there's someone else.

372
00:42:38,214 --> 00:42:40,919
Yes.

373
00:42:41,054 --> 00:42:43,074
Who is she?

374
00:42:43,509 --> 00:42:45,159
Mildred.

375
00:42:45,194 --> 00:42:47,154
She's come back.

376
00:42:48,314 --> 00:42:50,754
After all she's done.

377
00:42:51,794 --> 00:42:54,239
How could you?

378
00:42:54,274 --> 00:42:56,959
That's what I'd like to know.

379
00:42:56,994 --> 00:43:01,354
It's just as though
you're bound to her in some way.

380
00:43:01,389 --> 00:43:03,279
Yes.

381
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:05,434
As I am to you.

382
00:43:06,554 --> 00:43:08,798
And she was to Miller.

383
00:43:08,933 --> 00:43:13,274
As every human being is
to something or other.

384
00:43:26,754 --> 00:43:31,474
Funny looking little thing,
isn't it? I can't believe it's mine.

385
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:34,034
Now, if you'll excuse me.

386
00:43:41,874 --> 00:43:44,519
So glad it's over, darling.

387
00:43:44,554 --> 00:43:47,279
You've been so good to me, Philip.

388
00:43:47,314 --> 00:43:50,394
From now on,
things will be different.

389
00:43:56,234 --> 00:43:58,734
Now, you will take good care of her,
won't you?

390
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:01,274
That I will, ma'am.

391
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:05,794
- Good day.
- Good day.

392
00:44:10,234 --> 00:44:12,379
I know you don't like it, Philip.

393
00:44:12,414 --> 00:44:14,738
I can't do anything else
if I'm going to work.

394
00:44:14,739 --> 00:44:17,239
No, I suppose not.

395
00:44:17,773 --> 00:44:22,254
Be sure and go over on Sundays
and see the baby's taken care of.

396
00:44:22,289 --> 00:44:24,634
I will.

397
00:44:25,614 --> 00:44:29,314
What are we going to do
this afternoon?

398
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:31,474
I asked Griffiths to come over.

399
00:44:31,509 --> 00:44:34,879
Oh, did you? Why?

400
00:44:35,314 --> 00:44:40,514
I know you find him amusing and
I'm always afraid of... boring you.

401
00:44:47,854 --> 00:44:49,839
Hello, hello, hello.

402
00:44:49,874 --> 00:44:53,659
Sorry I'm late.
Had to get rid of a girl.

403
00:44:53,694 --> 00:44:57,114
- Why didn't you bring her?
- I'm not interested in my girl.

404
00:44:57,149 --> 00:45:02,614
- I'm interested in other men's girls.
- D'you like me?

405
00:45:07,994 --> 00:45:12,358
Really, I'm too hungry to know.
I think I like you lots.

406
00:45:12,393 --> 00:45:17,194
I'd like you more if he took us out
to dinner. I'd tell you stories.

407
00:45:17,229 --> 00:45:21,294
- You'll have a wonderful time.
- What would he do?

408
00:45:21,329 --> 00:45:24,034
Ooh, pay the bill.

409
00:45:35,513 --> 00:45:40,914
I said, "What's that? Your missus?
I thought it was your sister!"

410
00:45:51,074 --> 00:45:55,374
- Oh, allez-up!
- Allez-up!

411
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:58,374
"Thought it was your sister!"

412
00:46:07,194 --> 00:46:09,794
Good night, Philip.

413
00:46:11,913 --> 00:46:14,554
Good night.

414
00:46:23,654 --> 00:46:25,659
Just a moment.

415
00:46:25,694 --> 00:46:29,094
- Are you in love with Mildred?
- I?

416
00:46:30,774 --> 00:46:34,459
That's what you've been so
funny about! My dear old boy...

417
00:46:34,494 --> 00:46:39,654
Look here. It doesn't matter to you,
Harry. You've got so many women.

418
00:46:39,689 --> 00:46:43,273
- Don't take Mildred away from me.
- My dear old boy!

419
00:46:43,308 --> 00:46:47,834
She's nothing to me at all!
Nothing at all!

420
00:47:03,334 --> 00:47:06,594
- Do you like it, Philip?
- Very much.

421
00:47:06,629 --> 00:47:09,354
So nice of you to give it to me.

422
00:47:16,034 --> 00:47:18,294
What are you thinking about?

423
00:47:18,994 --> 00:47:21,854
You were having quite a flirtation
with Griffiths last night.

424
00:47:21,889 --> 00:47:23,714
Yes I was, wasn't I?

425
00:47:24,214 --> 00:47:28,894
Matter of fact, well...
I'm sort of in love with him.

426
00:47:29,194 --> 00:47:30,769
I'm not surprised!

427
00:47:30,804 --> 00:47:32,309
What do you mean?

428
00:47:32,344 --> 00:47:35,819
Well Griffiths is good looking, he amusing,
he says the kind things that make you laugh.

429
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:37,474
I'll thank you not to
make fun of me.

430
00:47:37,475 --> 00:47:39,375
You are a bit too superior for me
you fine young friend.

431
00:47:39,409 --> 00:47:40,958
Oh for heavens sake Mildred,
I wasn't making fun of you.

432
00:47:40,993 --> 00:47:44,634
- Well you certainly don't act as if it's
serious. - I don't think it is. - Why not?

433
00:47:44,834 --> 00:47:47,134
- Griffiths isn't in love with you.
- How do you know?

434
00:47:47,135 --> 00:47:48,335
I asked him.

435
00:47:51,354 --> 00:47:56,074
Would you like to read a letter
I got from him this morning?

436
00:48:00,874 --> 00:48:04,359
"I've been up all night
thinking about you.

437
00:48:04,394 --> 00:48:09,733
"I have just sent for a messenger
to take this to you in the dawn.

438
00:48:09,768 --> 00:48:15,001
"You've no notion of the time
I had with your friend last night.

439
00:48:15,036 --> 00:48:20,234
"He kept asking me if I love you
and of course what could I say?

440
00:48:20,269 --> 00:48:22,811
"He'll doubtless tell you all this,

441
00:48:22,846 --> 00:48:25,353
"so I'm making sure that you -"

442
00:48:32,014 --> 00:48:35,659
Well? Can't help it
if I love him, can I?

443
00:48:35,694 --> 00:48:38,634
- No. I suppose not.
- Then what you going on about?

444
00:48:38,635 --> 00:48:40,399
Nothing.

445
00:48:40,434 --> 00:48:43,113
Only I was fool enough to think
that you cared for me.

446
00:48:43,148 --> 00:48:47,219
I do, Philip. As a friend.

447
00:48:47,254 --> 00:48:49,719
Not in any other way.

448
00:48:50,254 --> 00:48:53,774
But you do care for Griffiths
in the other way.

449
00:48:55,614 --> 00:49:00,134
But you're cold. That sort of thing
doesn't mean anything to you.

450
00:49:02,014 --> 00:49:04,534
That's what you think.

451
00:49:13,094 --> 00:49:16,499
It's no use going on
about it, Philip.

452
00:49:16,834 --> 00:49:21,814
You said yourself that I couldn't
help it if I'm in love with him.

453
00:49:26,134 --> 00:49:29,414
If there's anything else
to be said, say it.

454
00:49:31,254 --> 00:49:34,294
That's a nice dress
you have on, Mildred.

455
00:49:34,295 --> 00:49:38,020
I couldn't afford it,
but I paid for it.

456
00:49:38,054 --> 00:49:41,179
You have a nice apartment.
I couldn't afford it but I...

457
00:49:41,214 --> 00:49:44,854
If you were a gentleman, would you
throw what you've done in my face?

458
00:49:44,855 --> 00:49:47,735
Do you think it matters to me
whether I'm a gentleman or not?

459
00:49:47,769 --> 00:49:51,614
If I were, you don't suppose
I'd care for a cheap vulgar little...

460
00:49:53,053 --> 00:49:57,154
I'm sorry, Philip.
I didn't want to end this way.

461
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:05,833
- Harry's waiting for me.
- What do you intend to do?

462
00:50:05,834 --> 00:50:08,555
We're going to Paris.

463
00:50:09,289 --> 00:50:13,311
Get out.
Get out!

464
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:08,934
I've moved three times and each time
this woman's hounded me down.

465
00:51:08,969 --> 00:51:12,851
- I don't like to do this but...
- All right, sir. I'll move her on.

466
00:51:13,033 --> 00:51:16,873
Come on, young lady.
You can't stay here. Come on, now.

467
00:51:42,994 --> 00:51:47,054
- Look here, Carey. Mildred and I
are all washed up... - Too bad.

468
00:51:48,394 --> 00:51:51,514
Excuse me. I'm due in the ward.

469
00:52:08,594 --> 00:52:11,314
Anything interesting, Carey?

470
00:52:11,615 --> 00:52:14,115
I was just thinking what an
unusual name you have.

471
00:52:14,149 --> 00:52:18,213
An old Yorkshire name. Once took
a day's riding across our estates.

472
00:52:18,313 --> 00:52:20,839
And here I am in a charity hospital

473
00:52:20,874 --> 00:52:24,914
because my father loved fast
women and slow horses.

474
00:52:24,949 --> 00:52:27,474
How the mighty are fallen!

475
00:52:29,954 --> 00:52:32,874
- Hello!
- Hello, Father.

476
00:52:36,674 --> 00:52:40,799
Carey, this is my daughter,
christened Maria del Sol.

477
00:52:40,834 --> 00:52:44,839
Her mother called her Sally.
This young man is a student here.

478
00:52:44,874 --> 00:52:49,554
He's been nice to me. With some
inducement, he might be nice to you.

479
00:52:49,589 --> 00:52:54,234
Now, Father. Father's particular
genius is saying the wrong thing.

480
00:52:54,269 --> 00:52:56,711
He thinks it's fun to embarrass me.

481
00:52:56,746 --> 00:53:00,319
It is. Try it some time, Carey.

482
00:53:00,354 --> 00:53:03,213
- I will, if I get the chance.
- You shall have it!

483
00:53:03,248 --> 00:53:07,273
You're coming to see us
the first Sunday I am home.

484
00:53:07,308 --> 00:53:10,394
Oh, yes. Please do.

485
00:53:34,594 --> 00:53:36,998
What a quaint house!

486
00:53:38,133 --> 00:53:42,513
- Yes, but it's not very sanitary.
- Sanitation be hanged! Give me art!

487
00:53:42,548 --> 00:53:46,594
I've got nine children
and they thrive on bad drains.

488
00:53:46,629 --> 00:53:50,754
- Look at that, now.
- I am, with great admiration.

489
00:53:53,874 --> 00:53:55,238
Shall I bring the ale, Father?

490
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:58,359
Right, m'girl.
The sooner the better.

491
00:53:59,094 --> 00:54:02,079
I hope you didn't have the table
in here on my account.

492
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:04,994
I'd be quiet happy to have had dinner
with Mrs. Athelny and the children.

493
00:54:05,029 --> 00:54:09,574
Oh, no. I always take meals by myself.
I like these antique customs.

494
00:54:10,509 --> 00:54:13,434
I don't think women ought
to sit down at table with men.

495
00:54:13,469 --> 00:54:17,093
- Don't you? Why not?
- It ruins conversation.

496
00:54:18,474 --> 00:54:21,834
It's bad for them.
Puts ideas in their heads!

497
00:54:21,835 --> 00:54:25,235
Women are never at ease
when they have ideas.

498
00:54:25,469 --> 00:54:28,599
- You sound like the voice
of old England. - I am, sir.

499
00:54:28,634 --> 00:54:33,039
This fine, old Yorkshire pudding
gives me strength to carry on.

500
00:54:33,374 --> 00:54:37,094
Now stop getting up and down like jumping
Jack every time she comes in the room.

501
00:54:37,129 --> 00:54:39,559
She doesn't want you to make
a fuss about it, do you Sally?

502
00:54:39,594 --> 00:54:43,634
She won't think it rude if you sit
still while she waits on you.

503
00:54:43,635 --> 00:54:46,835
She don't care a hang for
chivalry, do you, Sally?

504
00:54:46,869 --> 00:54:48,319
No, Father.

505
00:54:48,354 --> 00:54:52,954
You speak quietly while eyeing
the young man so boldly.

506
00:54:54,034 --> 00:54:56,398
Yes, Father.

507
00:54:56,433 --> 00:55:00,354
- You know what I'm talking about Sally?
- How could I, darling?

508
00:55:00,389 --> 00:55:02,359
You're so clever.

509
00:55:02,394 --> 00:55:05,994
Don't stand behind me
in order to make eyes at him.

510
00:55:06,029 --> 00:55:08,714
Better get Philip some more ale.

511
00:55:18,793 --> 00:55:22,794
My word! Is there anything better
than English ale?

512
00:55:22,829 --> 00:55:25,891
Let us thank God
for simple pleasures -

513
00:55:25,926 --> 00:55:29,254
a good appetite,
roast beef and beer.

514
00:55:29,889 --> 00:55:31,874
I was married to a lady once.

515
00:55:33,714 --> 00:55:38,839
- Good heavens! Never marry a lady,
my boy! - Oh, really? Why?

516
00:55:38,874 --> 00:55:43,674
Because a lady has a point of view,
a personality and an individuality.

517
00:55:43,675 --> 00:55:45,475
All the devil you with.

518
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:50,074
You want a wife who can cook dinner
and look after your children.

519
00:55:50,075 --> 00:55:51,474
Don't you think so, Sally?

520
00:55:51,509 --> 00:55:55,794
- I think you'd talk the hind leg
of the donkey. - It's clean fun.

521
00:55:55,829 --> 00:55:57,919
Now, Sally waited on me,
I'll wait on you.

522
00:55:57,954 --> 00:56:02,313
Take my chair while I fetch you and the
young man some cheese.

523
00:56:02,314 --> 00:56:03,914
Thank you, Father.

524
00:56:03,948 --> 00:56:06,274
What do you think of us?

525
00:56:07,434 --> 00:56:12,214
You don't know what this means to
me. I practically never had family.

526
00:56:12,249 --> 00:56:16,994
This is the only place I've known
that's had the quality of... home.

527
00:56:19,313 --> 00:56:20,394
Thank you, Father.

528
00:56:27,434 --> 00:56:30,554
It's no use mooning over her, Carey.

529
00:56:31,493 --> 00:56:35,874
Sally never kisses a gentleman
until he's been here twice.

530
00:56:37,874 --> 00:56:41,193
Well, you must ask me again,
some time.

531
00:56:41,228 --> 00:56:43,394
Do it yourself!

532
00:56:43,395 --> 00:56:45,874
Why don't you come next Sunday?

533
00:57:34,594 --> 00:57:37,334
- May I walk to the station with you?
- No.

534
00:57:37,335 --> 00:57:40,335
- Why not?
- It's too late and you're a child.

535
00:57:40,369 --> 00:57:42,254
I'm 20.

536
00:57:42,289 --> 00:57:44,794
Let's talk it over when you're 30.

537
00:58:00,434 --> 00:58:02,879
Did you hear what I said, old man?

538
00:58:02,914 --> 00:58:07,359
Yes, I heard. Sorry if I brought
up a painful subject.

539
00:58:07,394 --> 00:58:10,214
I thought you'd be interested
to hear about Mildred.

540
00:58:10,215 --> 00:58:13,415
- Sorry she's had a bad time.
- I gave her all I could,

541
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:18,894
but you know me, always stony broke.
I thought perhaps you'd want to...

542
00:58:18,994 --> 00:58:23,354
I can't do anything.
Got another cigarette?

543
00:58:23,389 --> 00:58:25,359
I don't blame you.

544
00:58:25,394 --> 00:58:30,219
I wouldn't have told you. She
asked me to give you her address.

545
00:58:30,254 --> 00:58:35,294
Gave me a jolt, seeing her with that
baby, asking for something to eat.

546
00:58:35,329 --> 00:58:38,319
- She had the baby with her?
- Yes.

547
00:58:38,354 --> 00:58:41,914
Not difficult to imagine
her next step.

548
00:59:32,314 --> 00:59:34,639
Baby all right?

549
00:59:34,674 --> 00:59:37,194
I'm very grateful to you, Philip.

550
00:59:38,114 --> 00:59:41,194
If I could afford it, I'd have given
you a place of your own.

551
00:59:41,195 --> 00:59:44,695
As it is, you're welcome to my room.

552
00:59:44,794 --> 00:59:48,754
I don't know what would become
of me and... baby...

553
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:50,911
if you hadn't taken us in.

554
00:59:50,946 --> 00:59:53,034
You'd have got on, I expect.

555
00:59:54,074 --> 00:59:56,974
You've always been much nicer
to me than I deserved.

556
00:59:57,675 --> 01:00:00,075
I'm beginning to realise
how silly I've been.

557
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:05,714
You couldn't help how you felt.
Let's not talk about it, shall we?

558
01:00:06,849 --> 01:00:09,314
I don't feel like that now.

559
01:00:09,915 --> 01:00:14,035
Look here, Mildred. Let's have
no misunderstanding about this.

560
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:17,199
- The reason you're here is...
- I know.

561
01:00:17,234 --> 01:00:20,713
Because you once liked me
enough to want to marry me.

562
01:00:23,174 --> 01:00:24,619
Yes.

563
01:00:24,654 --> 01:00:29,734
Well, at least I can cook for
you and keep your flat clean.

564
01:00:33,114 --> 01:00:36,813
Maybe some day you'll...
you'll feel better about me and...

565
01:00:37,948 --> 01:00:40,694
things will be like
they used to be.

566
01:00:44,874 --> 01:00:47,774
Oh, thanks. I'll smoke it later.

567
01:00:51,074 --> 01:00:54,634
Well... Good night.

568
01:00:57,514 --> 01:00:59,154
Good night.

569
01:01:51,114 --> 01:01:53,599
Landlady came upstairs
a little while ago.

570
01:01:53,634 --> 01:01:58,874
She said, "Mrs Carey," she said.
"How can you stand it?"

571
01:02:00,934 --> 01:02:05,194
- What's the matter with them?
- They're indecent. Disgusting, I calls it.

572
01:02:05,229 --> 01:02:08,558
To have drawings
of naked people about.

573
01:02:08,593 --> 01:02:13,314
If you want to know what I think,
I've half a mind to take them down.

574
01:02:13,349 --> 01:02:15,474
You'll do nothing of the kind.

575
01:02:17,714 --> 01:02:20,499
I love those pictures, Mildred.

576
01:02:20,534 --> 01:02:23,194
I love them for what
they were meant to be.

577
01:02:46,254 --> 01:02:48,314
What happened to it?

578
01:02:48,349 --> 01:02:50,399
Hm? What?

579
01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:53,354
The way you used to love me.

580
01:02:53,389 --> 01:02:55,319
Oh, I don't know.

581
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:58,974
I was disappointed so often
and hurt so much.

582
01:02:59,009 --> 01:03:01,859
What difference does it make?

583
01:03:01,994 --> 01:03:03,794
Nothing. Only...

584
01:03:03,995 --> 01:03:06,795
Remember how you got
when I was so cold to you?

585
01:03:07,514 --> 01:03:12,494
You're getting me that way
cos you're so cold to me.

586
01:03:12,529 --> 01:03:14,973
No-one else, is there?

587
01:03:57,534 --> 01:03:59,934
He's not in love with anybody.

588
01:04:40,874 --> 01:04:42,894
Where were you?

589
01:04:42,929 --> 01:04:44,879
Altherneys'.

590
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:47,474
What are you doing up?

591
01:04:47,509 --> 01:04:49,634
I couldn't sleep.

592
01:04:53,354 --> 01:04:56,114
Hadn't you better put on
something warmer?

593
01:04:56,149 --> 01:04:58,474
Oh, I'll be all right.

594
01:05:01,154 --> 01:05:03,634
Just let me stay here.

595
01:05:07,674 --> 01:05:09,274
Phil...

596
01:05:11,354 --> 01:05:14,439
- Phil, I love you so.
- Oh, nonsense.

597
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:17,805
T'isn't.
I can't live without you.

598
01:05:17,874 --> 01:05:21,594
Please get up. You're making a fool
of yourself and a fool of me.

599
01:05:21,629 --> 01:05:23,954
Oh, Phil. Please.

600
01:05:37,774 --> 01:05:39,954
I can't go on like this.

601
01:05:42,034 --> 01:05:46,094
Nonsense. You haven't anywhere
to go. Stay here as long as you like.

602
01:05:46,129 --> 01:05:48,914
But with the definite
understanding that...

603
01:05:57,694 --> 01:06:00,034
You disgust me.

604
01:06:03,354 --> 01:06:05,219
Me?

605
01:06:05,754 --> 01:06:08,074
I disgust you?

606
01:06:08,594 --> 01:06:11,394
You.
You!

607
01:06:11,395 --> 01:06:13,515
You're too fine!

608
01:06:13,516 --> 01:06:17,516
You won't have me but you sit here all
night looking at your naked females!

609
01:06:17,539 --> 01:06:19,361
- Mildred!
- You cad!

610
01:06:19,406 --> 01:06:21,559
You dirty swine!

611
01:06:21,594 --> 01:06:25,274
I never cared for you, not once.
I was always making a fool of you.

612
01:06:25,275 --> 01:06:27,475
You bored me stiff,
I hated you.

613
01:06:27,509 --> 01:06:32,434
It made me sick when I let you kiss
me. I did it because you begged me.

614
01:06:32,469 --> 01:06:34,439
You drove me crazy!

615
01:06:34,474 --> 01:06:40,074
And after you kissed me,
I always use to wipe my mouth!

616
01:06:40,109 --> 01:06:43,921
Well, I made up for it.
For every kiss, I had a laugh!

617
01:06:43,956 --> 01:06:47,634
Miller and me, and Griffiths and me.
We laughed at you.

618
01:06:47,669 --> 01:06:50,474
Because you were such a
mug, a mug, a mug!

619
01:06:52,034 --> 01:06:54,954
You know what you are,
you gippy-legged monster?

620
01:06:54,955 --> 01:06:57,940
You're a cripple! A cripple!
A cripple!

621
01:07:04,934 --> 01:07:08,794
You love these things.
You love what they were meant to be.

622
01:07:08,829 --> 01:07:13,434
Well, here's what
they were meant to be!

623
01:07:30,293 --> 01:07:32,734
You want to be a doctor!

624
01:07:59,554 --> 01:08:02,894
This will take you
through medical school.

625
01:08:20,654 --> 01:08:23,478
You're leaving? Why?

626
01:08:23,513 --> 01:08:26,954
- My money's gone.
- What do you intend to do?

627
01:08:26,989 --> 01:08:30,433
Oh... Anything.

628
01:08:32,414 --> 01:08:34,354
Before you go out into the world,

629
01:08:34,355 --> 01:08:37,855
don't you think we ought to do
something about that foot?

630
01:08:38,289 --> 01:08:40,271
Think it'll do any good?

631
01:08:40,306 --> 01:08:42,554
I'll know better tomorrow.

632
01:08:46,814 --> 01:08:49,774
- How are you, Philip?
- I'm all right, Sally.

633
01:08:49,809 --> 01:08:52,631
- How's your foot?
- Well...

634
01:08:53,466 --> 01:08:56,454
- Let's try it, shall we?
- All right.

635
01:08:58,594 --> 01:09:00,674
Careful now.

636
01:09:41,914 --> 01:09:45,039
<i>- No openings.
- Sorry, nothing today.</i>

637
01:09:45,074 --> 01:09:48,314
<i>- All situations filled.
- Nothing today.</i>

638
01:09:48,315 --> 01:09:51,215
<i>- No experience? Can't use you.
- Nothing today.</i>

639
01:09:51,249 --> 01:09:53,574
<i>- All situations filled.
- Sorry, no vacancies.</i>

640
01:09:53,609 --> 01:09:55,959
<i>- Nothing today. - No openings.
- Nothing.</i>

641
01:09:55,994 --> 01:09:58,494
<i>- Nothing. - Nothing.
- Nothing. - Nothing.</i>

642
01:09:58,529 --> 01:10:01,434
<i>- Nothing. - Nothing.
- Nothing.</i>

643
01:10:51,154 --> 01:10:54,594
- Why haven't you been to see us?
- Oh, I don't know, I...

644
01:10:54,629 --> 01:10:56,334
I've had things to do.

645
01:10:58,534 --> 01:11:02,074
- You've been putting on weight.
- I'm sure you haven't!

646
01:11:02,109 --> 01:11:05,379
- Why do you say that?
- The way you look.

647
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:09,180
- Oh! That's only my look!
- I'm afraid it's more than that.

648
01:11:09,235 --> 01:11:13,135
I sent you a note and when you
didn't answer I went to your room.

649
01:11:13,169 --> 01:11:17,234
Your landlady said
she had to put you out.

650
01:11:18,693 --> 01:11:21,094
Hello, Philip!

651
01:11:30,734 --> 01:11:35,674
My dear fellow, by pre-arranged signal,
my daughter communicated to me

652
01:11:35,675 --> 01:11:38,475
confirmation of our suspicions.

653
01:11:38,509 --> 01:11:41,131
As you know, I've been on
the beach most of my life.

654
01:11:41,166 --> 01:11:44,949
In Tahiti, I was President
of the Beachcombers' Union!

655
01:11:44,984 --> 01:11:48,733
I would like to enquire
into your amateur standing.

656
01:11:48,768 --> 01:11:51,059
Where have you been staying?

657
01:11:51,094 --> 01:11:55,379
- Oh... anywhere.
- Why didn't you come here?

658
01:11:55,414 --> 01:11:59,374
False modesty, I suppose.
Now, stop being an Englishman.

659
01:11:59,409 --> 01:12:02,634
When a man's on his uppers,
it's time he came down to Earth.

660
01:12:02,669 --> 01:12:06,074
- We want you here with us.
- Well, I...

661
01:12:07,614 --> 01:12:10,394
- Thanks very much, but...
- Don't talk trash.

662
01:12:10,395 --> 01:12:12,695
You're to stay until
you get your bearings.

663
01:12:12,729 --> 01:12:17,474
I want no more fine talk about it.
It's all arranged.

664
01:12:18,854 --> 01:12:20,694
Well...

665
01:12:21,854 --> 01:12:25,014
Well, here goes my amateur standing.

666
01:12:25,849 --> 01:12:28,339
I- I really have no place to go.

667
01:12:28,374 --> 01:12:30,254
- It's awfully good of you.
- Nonsense!

668
01:12:30,255 --> 01:12:32,855
You know, my house is
completely unsanitary.

669
01:12:32,889 --> 01:12:36,694
- You'll wind up with some foul disease!
- Let him alone, Father.

670
01:12:36,729 --> 01:12:39,851
- I want to talk to him.
- I suppose youth must be served.

671
01:12:39,886 --> 01:12:44,774
But I'm sick and tired
of serving it. Nine of them!

672
01:12:47,734 --> 01:12:50,939
- Will that do?
- Looks as if it might.

673
01:12:55,794 --> 01:12:58,399
Wouldn't be a very
nice night to be out.

674
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,400
Not really, no.

675
01:13:00,401 --> 01:13:04,701
- It's going to be jolly having you here.
- I hope I shan't have to stay very long.

676
01:13:04,769 --> 01:13:07,931
- You do? Why?
- I can't go on like this, you know.

677
01:13:07,966 --> 01:13:09,459
I need a job.

678
01:13:09,494 --> 01:13:14,274
- Father and I discussed that.
- There isn't much you've overlooked.

679
01:13:15,874 --> 01:13:19,974
I'll have to sew that on, too.
And Father has a job for you.

680
01:13:20,009 --> 01:13:23,294
- Has he? Where?
- Where he works.

681
01:14:15,234 --> 01:14:17,753
You walk all right now.

682
01:14:18,534 --> 01:14:20,694
I saw you in the window.

683
01:14:23,814 --> 01:14:26,574
I never thought you'd come to that.

684
01:14:29,734 --> 01:14:33,734
You're very hoarse.
Throat sore?

685
01:14:35,294 --> 01:14:38,113
You haven't forgotten
your doctoring, have you?

686
01:14:38,114 --> 01:14:41,914
- No.
- Because...

687
01:14:41,948 --> 01:14:45,054
That's what I want
to see you about.

688
01:14:45,089 --> 01:14:47,994
Why not go to a doctor?

689
01:14:50,754 --> 01:14:55,254
- There's the Free Hospital.
- All them students staring at me?

690
01:14:58,334 --> 01:15:04,214
- What seems to be the trouble?
- Well, I cough all the time.

691
01:15:05,294 --> 01:15:08,454
Let's have a look at your throat.

692
01:15:34,614 --> 01:15:36,294
Phil.

693
01:15:37,894 --> 01:15:41,094
It's not... me lungs, is it?

694
01:15:57,574 --> 01:15:59,554
Where's the baby?

695
01:16:00,854 --> 01:16:04,814
She died... last summer.

696
01:16:05,049 --> 01:16:06,099
Oh.

697
01:16:06,134 --> 01:16:11,414
- You might say you're sorry.
- I'm not. I'm very glad.

698
01:16:15,454 --> 01:16:18,414
I'm afraid I can't help you much.

699
01:16:25,814 --> 01:16:29,219
Don't leave me, Philip.
I know I've treated you shocking.

700
01:16:29,254 --> 01:16:33,734
But don't leave me. Not yet, please.
There's no-one I can go to.

701
01:16:33,769 --> 01:16:37,251
You're the only one that treated me
like I was human.

702
01:16:37,286 --> 01:16:41,934
You're a gentleman, Philip.
The only one I've ever met.

703
01:16:48,414 --> 01:16:50,614
Some things you'll need.

704
01:17:40,134 --> 01:17:42,294
Our last day.

705
01:17:46,374 --> 01:17:48,273
Why, Sally!

706
01:17:48,308 --> 01:17:50,638
Darling.

707
01:17:51,573 --> 01:17:54,439
I was so determined
not to let you see.

708
01:17:54,574 --> 01:17:58,614
Well, that's sweet of you
to care because I'm going away.

709
01:18:00,894 --> 01:18:03,514
I suppose I'm a fool to care, but...

710
01:18:03,515 --> 01:18:06,915
it doesn't mean you have
to do anything about it.

711
01:18:06,949 --> 01:18:12,254
You can't help it because someone
loves you and you don't love back.

712
01:18:12,789 --> 01:18:14,594
Sally, look at me.

713
01:18:17,194 --> 01:18:21,274
Darling, do you think you'll always
feel like this about me?

714
01:18:21,309 --> 01:18:22,694
Yes.

715
01:18:24,594 --> 01:18:28,414
I've known it since the first time
you came to our house.

716
01:18:29,694 --> 01:18:33,574
I thought at first that
I meant something to you, too.

717
01:18:33,609 --> 01:18:37,114
Oh, but you did.
You do.

718
01:18:38,674 --> 01:18:44,634
When I come back, if you still feel the
same, will you marry me, darling?

719
01:18:48,614 --> 01:18:51,614
Don't you mean if
you still feel the same?

720
01:19:11,114 --> 01:19:14,914
This is what you might call
the irony of fate.

721
01:19:14,949 --> 01:19:18,214
Come on now. Be quick.
Get her out of here.

722
01:19:19,854 --> 01:19:23,014
I don't want the likes of her
on me hands.

723
01:19:29,394 --> 01:19:33,174
- I understand there's an interesting case...- Look here old man. Don't go in there.

724
01:19:33,209 --> 01:19:35,179
Why not?

725
01:19:35,914 --> 01:19:38,314
- If you please...
- It's no use.

726
01:20:06,074 --> 01:20:08,654
Philip, I'm sorry I'm late.

727
01:20:08,689 --> 01:20:11,134
You're not. I'm not going.

728
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:21,814
What's that?

729
01:20:22,414 --> 01:20:25,474
My wedding present to my wife.

730
01:20:28,074 --> 01:20:31,114
When do you intend to marry me?

731
01:20:31,149 --> 01:20:32,959
Right away.

732
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:34,914
Thank you, Philip.

733
01:20:34,949 --> 01:20:37,499
Oh, I beg your pardon.

734
01:20:37,734 --> 01:20:39,774
You don't seem very pleased.

735
01:20:39,809 --> 01:20:42,059
Well, I am and I'm not.

736
01:20:42,094 --> 01:20:46,018
- Why? - I'm afraid
it's only a noble gesture.

737
01:20:46,053 --> 01:20:50,453
- That's not enough for marriage.
- No, Sally. It isn't just that.

738
01:20:50,488 --> 01:20:54,454
I like you far too much
to stand in your way.

739
01:21:21,934 --> 01:21:24,254
Philip, you're free.

740
01:21:24,255 --> 01:21:26,955
Yes, but suddenly...
there's nowhere to go.

741
01:21:27,089 --> 01:21:29,659
- Taxi, sir?
- No, thanks.

742
01:21:29,694 --> 01:21:32,378
I had to be free to realise that,

743
01:21:32,413 --> 01:21:37,034
free to understand that all those
years I dreamed of escape

744
01:21:37,035 --> 01:21:39,535
was because I was
limping through life.

745
01:21:39,569 --> 01:21:41,859
- Taxi, sir?
- No, thank you!

746
01:21:42,794 --> 01:21:47,674
And because I was bound up with
a person who was incredible to me.

747
01:21:47,709 --> 01:21:49,378
That's all over.

748
01:21:49,413 --> 01:21:52,793
I'm not limping any more.
My life's all right.

749
01:21:52,794 --> 01:21:55,694
Then why don't you go?

750
01:21:56,914 --> 01:22:01,094
Because everything that's
beautiful to me is right here.

751
01:22:01,429 --> 01:22:03,854
Won't you please marry me, Sally?

752
01:22:05,474 --> 01:22:09,013
- If you like.
- But don't you want to?

753
01:22:10,154 --> 01:22:13,374
Well, there's no-one else I'd marry.

754
01:22:16,214 --> 01:22:18,214
<i>How about a taxi, sir?</i>

755
01:22:18,249 --> 01:22:21,014
- What?
- How about a taxi?

756
01:22:21,049 --> 01:22:23,254
Yes!
