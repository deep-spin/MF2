1
00:00:13,496 --> 00:00:15,872
The Restoration of <i>FRAU IM MOND</i>
was carried out in 2000

2
00:00:15,998 --> 00:00:18,583
by the Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau
Foundation in Wiesbaden,

3
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,295
based on the camera negative from
the Bundesarchiv-Filmarchiv in Berlin.

4
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:25,298
The intertitles
were taken from the negatives.

5
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:29,261
The comparison and copying was carried out
by L'Immagine Ritrovata in Bologna.

6
00:00:29,387 --> 00:00:32,723
The master negative of this edit
was used for the 2K digital version.

7
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:41,231
<i>WOMAN IN THE MOON.</i>

8
00:03:00,037 --> 00:03:05,876
For the human mind,
there is no Never, — only a Not Yet.

9
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:14,217
Georg Manfeldt, Ph.D.
Professor of Astronomy

10
00:03:36,073 --> 00:03:42,245
You should have let that skunk
break his neck, Helius —

11
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:02,682
For thirty years I live like a dog
for the sake of my ideas —

12
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:06,436
and then comes this louse-fellow
speculating on my misery,

13
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:18,729
and wants to buy my manuscript
from me as a curiosity —

14
00:05:34,525 --> 00:05:40,697
I'd like to have dinner with you,
Professor — can you spare some bread?

15
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:58,173
I found this in my coat when
you left the other day —

16
00:05:58,299 --> 00:06:02,093
buy yourself some bread
with it, Mr Helius —

17
00:06:34,835 --> 00:06:46,835
Spare me having to take handouts
from my only friend, Helius...

18
00:08:55,309 --> 00:09:07,309
If you don't join me, Professor,
I won't be able to enjoy it.

19
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:14,405
FOOL OR SWINDLER?

20
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,846
Thursday, 17 August, 1896

21
00:12:03,205 --> 00:12:05,248
<i>Hypothetical Account</i>
<i>of the Gold Content</i>

22
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:08,209
<i>in the Mountains</i>
<i>of the Moon</i>

23
00:12:33,026 --> 00:12:37,321
I maintain, after many years of
comparative analyses,

24
00:12:37,448 --> 00:12:41,993
that primitive moon-rock contains
more gold than the earth's mountains.

25
00:12:57,968 --> 00:13:01,762
One day, the first spaceship
will fly to the moon,

26
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:06,142
to bring its gold
back to the earth.

27
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,831
Laughter, gentlemen, is
the argument of idiots

28
00:13:28,957 --> 00:13:31,792
against every new idea —

29
00:13:46,099 --> 00:13:48,476
The progress of the world
will not fail

30
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,395
due to learned ignoramuses
lacking in fantasy

31
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,149
whose brains work in inverse
proportion to their calcification —

32
00:14:42,197 --> 00:14:46,200
Professor —
I've decided to go...

33
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:14,061
But not without me, Helius —
not without me —

34
00:15:50,307 --> 00:15:54,477
Now your idea
will triumph after all, Professor...

35
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:12,995
Naturally Windegger
will go along?

36
00:16:20,921 --> 00:16:26,300
What — ? Windegger won't — ?
Your collaborator and best friend?

37
00:16:46,738 --> 00:16:50,908
Friede Velten,
student of astronomy,

38
00:16:50,992 --> 00:17:02,992
and Hans Windegger, Chief Engineer
of Helius Hangars are engaged.

39
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:09,255
Dear Friede.
Best wishes to you and Hans.

40
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:14,677
Don't be upset that I can't come tonight
to your engagement party.

41
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:17,888
Please accept the flowers
as a substitute.

42
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:20,057
Yours, Wolf Helius.

43
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:52,214
He doesn't even know anything
about my decision —

44
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:54,717
no-one does — except for you...

45
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:28,167
I tell you, Helius, more people
than you and I know of your plan —

46
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:44,099
— and the fellow whom I threw
down the stairs before is one of them —

47
00:21:03,954 --> 00:21:15,954
Three nights ago —

48
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:25,052
So you think someone
knows of my plans

49
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:29,098
and is thus also interested
in your moon-gold theory...?

50
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:47,866
Helius, don't be angry —
it's my life's work — go home —

51
00:23:48,201 --> 00:24:00,201
I can't rest until I know the
manuscript is in your safe.

52
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:41,415
Dear Helius. I write to you
in incomparable bliss

53
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:46,753
and you should be the first to know
that Friede has agreed to be my wife.

54
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:51,550
Perhaps I took her a bit
by surprise, but she said yes.

55
00:26:51,843 --> 00:26:55,345
Come tonight to the engagement
party at Friede's apartment.

56
00:26:55,471 --> 00:26:59,141
I am ridiculously happy.
Windegger

57
00:27:36,596 --> 00:27:39,723
Fresh violets, sir?

58
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:55,173
Wolf Helius, Bergstr. 86-3
To be delivered in person

59
00:28:57,135 --> 00:29:00,303
Mr Helius isn't home...

60
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:09,062
Please... let me wait for Mr Helius
anyway. Mr Windegger sent me...

61
00:29:29,625 --> 00:29:41,625
<i>To be delivered in person</i>

62
00:35:09,799 --> 00:35:13,551
Dear Helius. Accept this poor soul,
if you can, and give him work

63
00:35:13,677 --> 00:35:17,138
and a chance to make a life —
he won't disappoint you.

64
00:35:17,223 --> 00:35:19,474
Warmest regards,
Windegger

65
00:35:40,496 --> 00:35:42,747
Drive to the nearest
police station —

66
00:35:42,873 --> 00:35:45,250
don't hold things up
with long explanations —

67
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:47,669
just bring some sort
of officer here to me.

68
00:36:39,805 --> 00:36:42,765
<i>Saturn-Pirates</i>

69
00:36:44,518 --> 00:36:49,105
<i>The thieves' craft approaches</i>
<i>unlucky Saturn — </i>

70
00:37:10,085 --> 00:37:15,089
God in Heaven; you must have some
idea when you last phoned —

71
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:34,419
Did you leave the flat
unattended — ?

72
00:38:37,965 --> 00:38:41,384
Only for a moment, when
Gustav came to get me...

73
00:38:41,468 --> 00:38:45,304
but then there was that man
whom Mr Windegger had sent —

74
00:39:23,927 --> 00:39:26,888
Would you allow me
to use your telephone?

75
00:39:27,014 --> 00:39:29,223
My phone isn't working...

76
00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:29,700
Christ, madame —
someone has to pick up —

77
00:40:29,868 --> 00:40:33,371
there's at least half a dozen
people sitting around that phone —

78
00:41:03,902 --> 00:41:07,196
I'm only the foreman
of Helius Hangars —

79
00:41:07,322 --> 00:41:09,448
but if you keep working like this,

80
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:13,077
you, Miss Friede, will soon be
the forewoman of us all.

81
00:42:13,555 --> 00:42:15,640
I was supposed to have sent you

82
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:18,476
somebody with a letter
of recommendation — ?

83
00:42:29,488 --> 00:42:31,948
I'm begging you, Hans,
get over here...

84
00:42:32,074 --> 00:42:35,451
I can't tell you over the telephone
what this is all about...

85
00:42:35,702 --> 00:42:36,994
just, please, come...

86
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:04,230
You can be assured, Hans,
that I would not call you away

87
00:43:04,314 --> 00:43:07,358
from your engagement party
if it weren't absolutely necessary...

88
00:43:22,124 --> 00:43:34,124
We'll be there right away,
Helius.

89
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:24,829
Allow me to introduce myself — :
Turner...

90
00:45:50,272 --> 00:45:53,149
If you go flying down those
steps again, Mr Turner,

91
00:45:53,233 --> 00:45:56,402
I won't be standing at the
bottom to catch you...

92
00:46:05,245 --> 00:46:09,498
Believe me, Mr Helius, there's
no wiser way to pass the time

93
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:12,460
till the arrival of Ms Velten
and Mr Windegger

94
00:46:12,586 --> 00:46:14,336
than to have a chat with me...

95
00:46:43,408 --> 00:46:46,660
First, a small request...

96
00:46:46,786 --> 00:46:49,997
tell your chauffeur it's no longer
necessary to inform the police...

97
00:46:57,589 --> 00:47:01,550
The police have already
been informed, Mr Turner...

98
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:49,765
Just a measure of caution,
Mr Helius, — as well as this...

99
00:49:13,767 --> 00:49:17,770
Also a measure of caution,
Mr Turner?

100
00:49:44,464 --> 00:49:46,882
I now grasp the phenomenon,
Mr Turner,

101
00:49:46,966 --> 00:49:50,552
how you haven't been whiling
away in prison all this time —

102
00:49:58,395 --> 00:50:02,314
You do flatter,
Mr Helius.

103
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:21,166
Perhaps you can also
reveal to me, Mr Turner,

104
00:50:21,292 --> 00:50:23,377
where the stolen manuscript —

105
00:50:23,461 --> 00:50:26,588
and the contents missing
from my safe are located — ?

106
00:50:36,015 --> 00:50:39,184
Five of the wealthiest
and cleverest minds

107
00:50:39,352 --> 00:50:43,105
who wish to keep the earth's
gold reserve under their control —

108
00:51:41,873 --> 00:51:45,751
One of the most interesting
documents, madame and sirs...

109
00:52:07,607 --> 00:52:10,400
To prove the accessibility
of the moon,

110
00:52:10,485 --> 00:52:11,860
Helius sent the unmanned
trial rocket H.32,

111
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:16,740
filled with magnesium, moonward —
the explosion of which,

112
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:21,537
upon impact, was viewed and
photographed from the earth.

113
00:52:37,971 --> 00:52:39,721
Thanks to the competence
of our representative

114
00:52:39,848 --> 00:52:42,516
I can show you something
completely different —

115
00:52:43,042 --> 00:52:47,719
things that Helius himself has thus 
far not made accessible to science.

116
00:53:11,963 --> 00:53:15,883
Cinematographic images
of the surface of the moon

117
00:53:15,925 --> 00:53:20,053
by H.32 during its first
orbit of the moon.

118
00:53:20,221 --> 00:53:24,266
The unmanned
register-rocket H.32,

119
00:53:24,392 --> 00:53:28,520
equipped with automatic
imaging-instruments.

120
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:36,445
The rocket-jet.

121
00:53:43,995 --> 00:53:45,954
In its nose-cone...

122
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,295
...is located the egg-shaped
register-chamber

123
00:53:53,338 --> 00:53:56,882
with the automated
imaging-instruments.

124
00:54:05,391 --> 00:54:09,311
The imaging-instrument,
linked to a clockwork.

125
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:23,742
The mirror tele-objective.

126
00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:32,000
Schematic depiction
of the H.32's trajectory.

127
00:54:35,964 --> 00:54:38,340

00:54:48,893 --> 00:54:51,186

133
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:26,763
First image of the moon,
36 hours after lift-off;

134
00:55:26,889 --> 00:55:31,601
Distance of the rocket from
the moon: approx. 40,000 km.

135
00:55:48,703 --> 00:55:52,414
At an altitude
of approx. 1000 km

136
00:55:52,498 --> 00:55:56,168
H.32 flies over the
moon crater Eratosthenes —

137
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:04,176
— in its depths the astronomer
W. H. Pickering,

138
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,054
director of Mandeville
Observatory, Jamaica,

139
00:56:07,138 --> 00:56:09,765
believes to have observed
swarms of insects.

140
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:27,074
The objective's eye sees what
no man's eye has ever seen:

141
00:56:27,116 --> 00:56:31,912
the opposite side of the moon
turned away from the earth.

142
00:56:42,006 --> 00:56:45,467
Cryptic, monochrome planes
of colossal dimensions —

143
00:56:45,551 --> 00:56:49,304
Vegetation? Fog?
Water? —

144
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:13,245
— all seem to confirm the theory
of Prof. Peter Andreas Hansen

145
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:15,497
— of the Seeberg Observatory
near Gotha —

146
00:57:15,581 --> 00:57:17,707
that on the opposite side
of the moon

147
00:57:17,792 --> 00:57:20,210
exists an atmosphere
and, therefore, life.

148
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:43,275
Why lose any more time?

149
00:57:43,401 --> 00:57:47,320
I for one want the
moon's riches of gold,

150
00:57:47,405 --> 00:57:49,489
should they actually prove
to exist, to fall into the hands

151
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:53,118
of businessmen and not
visionaries and idealists.

152
00:58:09,135 --> 00:58:12,596
At this moment our
representative is making

153
00:58:12,722 --> 00:58:14,806
Mr Helius aware
of our intentions

154
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:16,474
in a very concrete manner...

155
00:58:22,648 --> 00:58:26,234
You have only two choices,
Mr Helius:

156
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:29,946
either make the trip
to the moon in our employ —

157
00:58:37,121 --> 00:58:38,955
— or not at all...

158
00:58:58,017 --> 00:59:00,143
If we don't come to an
agreement, Mr Helius,

159
00:59:00,186 --> 00:59:02,229
five minutes after
my departure,

160
00:59:02,355 --> 00:59:04,773
your hangar, along with the
nearly completed spaceship,

161
00:59:04,899 --> 00:59:06,858
will be reduced to
a heap of rubble...

162
00:59:22,541 --> 00:59:26,628
What would you gain, by
removing me, Mr Helius? —

163
00:59:26,671 --> 00:59:30,674
at the most, a travel companion
who is less considerate.

164
00:59:39,183 --> 00:59:41,768
You still don't get the
picture, Mr Helius...

165
00:59:41,852 --> 00:59:44,145
we'd rather annihilate
all of your plans

166
00:59:44,397 --> 00:59:47,357
than let you shut us
out of the operation...

167
01:00:11,882 --> 01:00:15,385
Tell your clients,
Mr Turner, that I do not aim

168
01:00:15,469 --> 01:00:19,306
to found upon the moon
a criminal colony...

169
01:01:13,402 --> 01:01:25,402
Give me 24 hours
to think it over...

170
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:47,597
Will your... plans be seriously
affected by the theft, Helius?

171
01:03:55,814 --> 01:03:59,984
Don't worry about the plans — .
I have duplicates

172
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:03,863
of everything, safe in my
desk's secret compartment.

173
01:04:14,625 --> 01:04:26,625
Hans dear, if I were you, I
wouldn't be so sure about that.

174
01:05:51,597 --> 01:05:54,599
Why did you conceal from us,
Helius, the fact that you now

175
01:05:54,767 --> 01:05:58,102
actually want to take on
the voyage to the moon?

176
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:31,844
You've called me your good
comrade so often at work —

177
01:06:32,096 --> 01:06:34,347
in the laboratory —
in this very room...

178
01:06:34,556 --> 01:06:36,933
now you want to lie
to me, Helius?

179
01:07:30,154 --> 01:07:31,988
I didn't mean to lie
to you, Friede —

180
01:07:32,072 --> 01:07:34,157
I just wanted to spare
Hans the conflict

181
01:07:34,283 --> 01:07:36,617
between his love for you
and his sense of duty

182
01:07:36,702 --> 01:07:39,203
towards the work
we've been doing.

183
01:07:43,709 --> 01:07:46,502
But do you really
believe, Helius,

184
01:07:46,545 --> 01:07:49,672
that Hans would ever be
capable of letting you down?.

185
01:08:01,018 --> 01:08:07,106
Oh no, Helius. You won't make
the trip to the moon without Windegger...

186
01:08:12,738 --> 01:08:15,990
— and not without me —

187
01:08:49,191 --> 01:08:52,527
Have you forgotten, Friede,
how those fared

188
01:08:52,653 --> 01:08:55,822
that dared this trip
to the moon before us —

189
01:08:55,948 --> 01:09:02,036
IN MEMORY OF...

190
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:08,459
TO THE BOLD PIONEERS
OF SPACE NAVIGATION

191
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:14,632
WHO DID NOT RETURN FROM
THEIR JOURNEY INTO OUTER SPACE

192
01:09:14,716 --> 01:09:17,218
THEY LIVED AND DIED FOR
A GREAT IDEA

193
01:09:17,302 --> 01:09:20,847
HONOUR THEIR MEMORY

194
01:09:34,611 --> 01:09:38,739
Friede — don't you get it?.
I just couldn't stand

195
01:09:38,824 --> 01:09:41,242
to know you were in danger —
God in heaven —

196
01:09:41,493 --> 01:09:53,493
and what danger indeed —

197
01:11:08,664 --> 01:11:12,541
He's decided to travel
to the moon, Hans...

198
01:11:30,268 --> 01:11:34,313
So when do we start — ?
And who will go with us...?

199
01:11:46,785 --> 01:11:48,786
Ask Friede...

200
01:12:23,989 --> 01:12:27,742
Friede... Do you want to
go with me — ?

201
01:13:14,164 --> 01:13:19,460
...in exactly 24 hours...

202
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:47,488
Mr Helius, the 24 hours
for consideration

203
01:13:47,572 --> 01:13:50,699
were up 61 minutes ago...

204
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:24,733
The explosion is of no
concern, Mr Helius —

205
01:14:24,818 --> 01:14:29,155
it's nothing but a small
accentuation of my offers...

206
01:14:54,806 --> 01:14:57,433
The price of this first
warning, Mr Windegger,

207
01:14:57,517 --> 01:15:00,019
is the hangar;
just a shack...

208
01:15:00,145 --> 01:15:02,563
the second one will cost
the lives of men...

209
01:15:02,689 --> 01:15:04,315
the third,
the spaceship...

210
01:15:31,259 --> 01:15:35,721
Don't force me, Mr Helius,
to take stronger measures;

211
01:15:35,972 --> 01:15:40,309
choose the lesser of
two evils — : me.

212
01:15:57,535 --> 01:15:59,536
I give you my word,
Mr Helius,

213
01:15:59,579 --> 01:16:02,581
the very hour that we
come to an agreement,

214
01:16:02,749 --> 01:16:05,709
you'll get your
stolen material back,

215
01:16:05,794 --> 01:16:17,794
complete and in
perfect condition...

216
01:17:55,528 --> 01:18:00,407
...the Spaceship "FRIEDE"
[Peace] is ready for launch...

217
01:18:28,978 --> 01:18:33,774
...at moonrise the spaceship
will soar into outer space,...

218
01:18:44,244 --> 01:18:47,955
...only to land — if God sees
fit — 36 hours later

219
01:18:48,039 --> 01:18:51,667
upon the opposite side
of the moon...

220
01:19:46,639 --> 01:19:48,724
...at this moment
bells will ring —

221
01:19:48,766 --> 01:19:51,810
the sirens of all the
factories, trains and ships

222
01:19:51,936 --> 01:19:54,813
around the world will wail
to honour the pioneers

223
01:19:54,856 --> 01:20:06,856
of space navigation...

224
01:24:28,129 --> 01:24:31,047
In this final hour I must
once again warn all of you...

225
01:24:31,174 --> 01:24:33,258
You, Manfeldt, and you —
Mr Turner;

226
01:24:33,342 --> 01:24:37,929
I'm leaving out Windegger;
and as for you... Friede —

227
01:24:47,523 --> 01:24:50,859
Friede... in this last minute...
— I'm begging you —

228
01:24:56,407 --> 01:24:58,950
Don't beg me, Helius.

229
01:25:18,221 --> 01:25:20,055
Helius, in this last instant,

230
01:25:20,139 --> 01:25:22,057
do you want to shame
me as a woman?

231
01:25:22,225 --> 01:25:24,810
...the whole world's eyes
are directed upon us... —

232
01:25:24,977 --> 01:25:27,312
...the whole world's ears
are listening to us...

233
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:53,296
Everyone to their stations...
We launch in 50 minutes —

234
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:45,432
...the whole world's eyes
are directed upon us... —

235
01:26:45,558 --> 01:26:48,602
...the whole world's ears
are listening to us...

236
01:26:48,686 --> 01:26:51,646
Just now

237
01:26:51,772 --> 01:26:53,648
Just now the

238
01:26:53,733 --> 01:26:55,692
Just now the spaceship

239
01:26:55,776 --> 01:26:57,485
Just now the spaceship has

240
01:26:57,778 --> 01:26:59,529
Just now the spaceship has
reached

241
01:26:59,614 --> 01:27:01,573
Just now the spaceship has
reached the

242
01:27:01,616 --> 01:27:03,533
Just now the spaceship has
reached the launch pad...

243
01:27:31,938 --> 01:27:36,524
...because the spaceship is built
too light to stand freely,

244
01:27:36,609 --> 01:27:41,279
it's submerged in a water-basin
in which it floats upright...

245
01:28:19,485 --> 01:28:22,696
From the moment of launch
till attaining the necessary

246
01:28:22,863 --> 01:28:25,657
speed of 11,200 km
per second...

247
01:28:25,783 --> 01:28:30,912
SPEED

248
01:28:37,253 --> 01:28:39,337
...there will be 8 critical minutes

249
01:28:39,422 --> 01:28:43,299
in the battle with the increase
in speed, with G-force,

250
01:28:43,384 --> 01:28:46,052
which has a fatal effect
upon human organisms

251
01:28:46,137 --> 01:28:48,430
when it goes over
40 metres per second...

252
01:28:48,681 --> 01:28:54,269
G-FORCE

253
01:29:01,527 --> 01:29:05,697
...after these 8 minutes,
during which we'll feel

254
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:09,534
an intolerable burden pulling
our bodies back to earth,

255
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:12,704
we'll be victors in the battle
with gravitational force... or —

256
01:29:35,853 --> 01:29:40,398
...and if we aren't able to
maintain our speed of 11,200...

257
01:29:40,483 --> 01:29:44,903
then we'll hurtle — and hurtle —
further — and further still —

258
01:29:52,912 --> 01:29:55,080
— irretrievably lost
in outer space —

259
01:29:55,206 --> 01:29:57,707
never again... never again...
to return to the earth...

260
01:30:01,879 --> 01:30:13,879
I'll be the one to pull the
stop-lever, Windegger....

261
01:33:15,322 --> 01:33:18,574
60 seconds to go —

262
01:33:38,929 --> 01:33:43,808
20 seconds to go — lie still —
take a deep breath —

263
01:34:11,462 --> 01:34:12,337
NOW

264
01:34:32,483 --> 01:34:37,320
Launch-rocket depleted.
Full throttle on middle-rocket.

265
01:35:54,064 --> 01:36:06,064
Windegger... jettison...
middle---rocket...

266
01:37:20,567 --> 01:37:32,567
Turn... back...

267
01:43:31,813 --> 01:43:35,065
Maybe this chap is dead?.

268
01:44:39,798 --> 01:44:43,842
I think Josephine
needs a brandy.

269
01:44:51,726 --> 01:44:55,771
I think Mr Turner needs
one even more.

270
01:45:35,729 --> 01:45:47,729
Don't you see, someone is
stowed away in the cargo hold.

271
01:47:37,767 --> 01:47:44,273
You wretched scoundrel,
how did you get in here?

272
01:47:46,484 --> 01:47:53,073
I've devoted my whole life
to moon-issues, Mr Helius.

<i>Logbook of the Spaceship</i>
<i>FRIEDE</i>

280
01:52:12,834 --> 01:52:20,173
Turning the spaceship's
black side toward the sun...

281
01:52:43,239 --> 01:52:51,997
to absorb warmth. —

282
01:52:59,046 --> 01:53:05,218
All's well on board.
227,000 km from earth.

283
01:53:05,511 --> 01:53:08,472
Stopping the last jets,
flying without propulsion.

284
01:53:08,806 --> 01:53:20,806
Weightlessness
on board.

285
01:54:59,667 --> 01:55:05,255
Have entered the moon's
gravitational field. —

286
01:55:05,381 --> 01:55:09,968
Are within 9000 km of the moon.

287
01:55:22,648 --> 01:55:28,153
Through the directional
boosts mentioned above

288
01:55:28,237 --> 01:55:29,863
weight regained on board.

289
01:55:29,947 --> 01:55:33,617
Turning the spaceship
with the jets in direction of

290
01:55:33,743 --> 01:55:39,164
destination to fire brake
boosts to prevent

291
01:55:39,248 --> 01:55:44,502
premature crash
on the moon. —

292
01:55:51,344 --> 01:55:57,682
Are about to reach the
side of the moon

293
01:55:57,767 --> 01:56:04,022
facing away from earth.
Watching the earth set.

294
01:56:55,908 --> 01:57:00,078
We're seeing it again, Hans...
we're seeing it again.

295
01:57:06,210 --> 01:57:09,504
And when are we finally
going to land?

296
01:57:13,509 --> 01:57:19,639
If we had a spark of reason
in us, we wouldn't ever land —

297
01:57:25,521 --> 01:57:28,565
You're just afraid —
you weakling —

298
01:57:48,836 --> 01:57:52,130
Tell him he has no right
to jeopardise all our lives

299
01:57:52,256 --> 01:57:55,133
for the sake of his
ambition....

300
01:58:04,101 --> 01:58:09,022
By God now is not the time
for arguments, Hans —

301
01:58:58,072 --> 01:59:10,072
Shut the window hatches —

302
02:00:30,748 --> 02:00:34,042
Full brake-power —
we're plummeting —

303
02:00:41,842 --> 02:00:43,801
Hold on tight — ....

304
02:01:25,260 --> 02:01:31,307
The ignition cable probably
isn't going to fix itself.

305
02:01:39,441 --> 02:01:41,818
The moon awaits....

306
02:01:53,205 --> 02:01:56,290
First though we have to
do an air sample,

307
02:01:56,417 --> 02:01:59,335
to tell whether we can
breathe outside.

308
02:02:03,757 --> 02:02:05,717
Do what you want.

309
02:02:05,968 --> 02:02:09,721
I'm only interested in how
I'll get back out of here.

310
02:02:55,893 --> 02:02:58,686
I'll tell you just
one thing, Friede,

311
02:02:58,771 --> 02:03:01,731
as soon as I have
the spaceship ready

312
02:03:01,774 --> 02:03:03,941
to launch again, I'll
fly back to earth —

313
02:03:04,068 --> 02:03:05,860
and neither Helius nor
Manfeldt will stop me — .

314
02:03:22,920 --> 02:03:27,882
Do you really aim to
stab Helius in the back?

315
02:03:35,516 --> 02:03:40,394
Do you really aim to
stab <i>me</i> in the back?

316
02:03:56,995 --> 02:04:00,206
Now Helius has no choice
but to prepare right away

317
02:04:00,332 --> 02:04:03,167
for the trip back —

318
02:04:21,478 --> 02:04:27,567
But Helius is convinced that
we'll find water with the divining rod.

319
02:04:31,738 --> 02:04:34,991
You know what
the only thing is

320
02:04:35,075 --> 02:04:37,994
that we'll find on the moon —

321
02:04:46,628 --> 02:04:48,921
— death.

322
02:05:04,396 --> 02:05:08,566
Professor, please, help me
with the air-sample.

323
02:05:55,614 --> 02:05:57,698
For God's sake,
don't open it —

324
02:05:57,866 --> 02:05:59,450
If he opens the outer door

325
02:05:59,743 --> 02:06:02,495
and outside there's no
breathable atmosphere,

326
02:06:02,621 --> 02:06:14,621
then we're done for good.

327
02:08:02,324 --> 02:08:05,951
He's taken the divining rod
with him.

328
02:08:34,731 --> 02:08:38,734
It's as if the rod is
pulling him forward.

329
02:09:58,732 --> 02:10:02,776
Mingo would follow
this trail, Mr Helius.

330
02:10:11,161 --> 02:10:15,080
The main objective should be
to look for water.

331
02:10:26,801 --> 02:10:31,805
I have enough to do, to
get us ready to launch again.

332
02:10:54,496 --> 02:10:57,039
May I volunteer to look
for Professor Manfeldt

333
02:10:57,123 --> 02:10:59,250
and, at the same time, water?

334
02:12:06,109 --> 02:12:08,527
Atmosphere breathable,

335
02:12:08,612 --> 02:12:12,031
Törner on the trail
for three hours

336
02:12:12,115 --> 02:12:15,784
of Manfeldt searching
for water.

337
02:13:00,205 --> 02:13:12,205
Since when is Gustav
your secretary?

338
02:16:09,769 --> 02:16:11,270
I can't stand it anymore...

339
02:16:11,312 --> 02:16:13,772
I'm going to look
for Manfeldt —

340
02:16:28,288 --> 02:16:40,288
From Miss Friede...
so you won't go hungry.

341
02:26:28,512 --> 02:26:40,512
Don't let him into the ship..
Don't let him into the ship...

342
02:30:16,949 --> 02:30:20,535
Is there anyone in the world
to whom we should relay

343
02:30:20,619 --> 02:30:24,288
your last regards — if we
get back to earth?

344
02:31:14,214 --> 02:31:16,549
The oxygen containers —

345
02:31:16,675 --> 02:31:18,968
the shot hit the oxygen
containers —

346
02:31:25,809 --> 02:31:27,810
What does this mean,
Miss Friede,

347
02:31:27,895 --> 02:31:30,188
with the oxygen containers?

348
02:31:37,821 --> 02:31:41,741
Let's pray to God
it means nothing.

349
02:32:18,070 --> 02:32:22,073
We've lost more than
half of the oxygen.

350
02:32:31,416 --> 02:32:36,254
That means: one of us
can't go back to earth —

351
02:32:36,296 --> 02:32:38,840
One of us has to
stay on the moon —

352
02:33:00,320 --> 02:33:03,573
Yes, Windegger:
one of us.

353
02:33:19,298 --> 02:33:21,507
Do you know what this
means — do you?

354
02:33:21,592 --> 02:33:23,634
To stay here —
alone on the moon —

355
02:33:23,719 --> 02:33:26,012
just because you didn't
want to listen to me —

356
02:33:26,096 --> 02:33:28,139
you and him..

357
02:34:02,799 --> 02:34:05,259
Short one loses —
long one wins...

358
02:34:05,344 --> 02:34:17,344
and we draw three times...
how's that?

359
02:36:56,598 --> 02:36:59,016
You draw —

360
02:37:12,823 --> 02:37:24,823
So draw then —

361
02:38:43,455 --> 02:38:45,789
Would it be easier
for you, Hans,

362
02:38:45,916 --> 02:38:48,250
if I stayed with you
on the moon?

363
02:39:03,850 --> 02:39:08,312
I have only one desire:
to get back to earth —

364
02:39:53,275 --> 02:39:56,110
Let's drink to a happy
homecoming to earth —

365
02:39:56,152 --> 02:39:58,195
for all of us...

366
02:40:09,457 --> 02:40:14,086
...to a happy homecoming —
for all of us, Hans.

367
02:40:33,732 --> 02:40:37,693
The depot is ready,
Mr Helius.

368
02:41:49,265 --> 02:41:54,103
Now you must prove, Gustav,
that I can rely upon you.

369
02:42:03,947 --> 02:42:08,158
I'm staying back
here on the moon...

370
02:42:22,507 --> 02:42:27,136
— and you will guide the
spaceship away from the moon.

371
02:42:45,864 --> 02:42:48,365
Do you want Mr Windegger
to perish — ?

372
02:42:48,533 --> 02:42:51,160
And Miss Friede,
who loves him — ?

373
02:43:25,945 --> 02:43:27,863
The enormous shock
of the launch

374
02:43:28,156 --> 02:43:30,240
will naturally wake
the sleepers —

375
02:43:30,366 --> 02:43:33,202
and then Mr Windegger
will take over the command...

376
02:43:42,462 --> 02:43:45,923
Dear Hans. I am convinced
that you won't let me down

377
02:43:46,049 --> 02:43:49,343
just as I haven't let you down.

378
02:43:49,427 --> 02:43:52,846
I shall wait calmly
and with confidence

379
02:43:53,139 --> 02:44:05,139
that you'll come to get me.
My greetings to Friede. — Helius.

380
02:45:44,417 --> 02:45:56,417
Farewell.
