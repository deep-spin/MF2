1
00:02:38,014 --> 00:02:38,984
Gentlemen!

2
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:39,987
Gentlemen!

3
00:02:40,011 --> 00:02:41,451
In your chairs,
brothers and sisters.

4
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,004
Now, I propose that we
devote the closing prayer

5
00:02:45,028 --> 00:02:46,996
to a faithful
member of our flock

6
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,981
who is leaving us
tonight, to fill

7
00:02:50,005 --> 00:02:53,997
a position of great
importance in foreign parts.

8
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:57,990
I refer to our
brother, Brutus Jones.

9
00:02:59,016 --> 00:03:02,028
Will you bow your
heads in prayer?

10
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,991
Almighty everlasting God, we
the people of Hezekiah Baptist

11
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:13,985
Church is gathered
together for the purpose

12
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:17,005
of giving into your keeping
our brother, Brutus Jones.

13
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:25,983
Like the prodigal son in
the story, he's-a setting

14
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:29,978
out on a far journey.

15
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:34,998
But this boy ain't
like the prodigal son.

16
00:03:35,022 --> 00:03:40,991
He ain't shiftless,
and he ain't worthless.

17
00:03:41,015 --> 00:03:44,986
Oh, Lord, he ain't puffed up.

18
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:51,023
And he ain't vainglorious, Lord.

19
00:03:57,007 --> 00:03:57,992
Mm mm, honey.

20
00:03:58,016 --> 00:04:01,999
You sure is wonderful
in them clothes.

21
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:03,002
Yeah.

22
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:04,980
I suppose these
clothes is something

23
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:06,983
to look at back here, honey.

24
00:04:07,007 --> 00:04:09,982
Where I been while I've
been training for the job,

25
00:04:10,006 --> 00:04:11,982
you would notice 'em.

26
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:15,003
Well, you ought to see them
New York girls on Lenox Avenue.

27
00:04:15,027 --> 00:04:17,978
Them gals is fast, I bet.

28
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:19,983
Switching theirselves
to catch the men.

29
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:21,988
But honey, you wouldn't
look at none of them

30
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:26,999
fast gals whiles you away
from home, would you?

31
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:28,004
They ain't none of 'em as pretty

32
00:04:28,028 --> 00:04:31,984
in the face like mine gal.

33
00:04:32,008 --> 00:04:34,989
And that prodigal son, he takes

34
00:04:35,013 --> 00:04:37,995
the inheritance for
his pappy gives him,

35
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:40,978
and he spend it
on the fast life.

36
00:04:41,002 --> 00:04:43,005
But not this boy, Lord.

37
00:04:43,029 --> 00:04:45,985
No, Jesus, not this boy.

38
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:48,983
And the prodigal son is a liar,

39
00:04:49,007 --> 00:04:51,004
and the truth ain't in him!

40
00:04:51,028 --> 00:04:53,979
But not this boy, Lord.

41
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:54,999
He got the truth, Lord!

42
00:04:55,023 --> 00:04:56,996
You know I looks up, and there's

43
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,991
the Capitol building, looking
like a palace on the hill.

44
00:05:01,015 --> 00:05:04,980
And the big front door opens,
and the President of the United

45
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,996
States marches down the
avenue with a band before

46
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,005
and a band behind.

47
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:12,996
And he comes right up to my car,
and he says, just as natural,

48
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,997
"Well, Brutus, you
sure is much of a man.

49
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:17,986
And I, for one,
wants to compliment

50
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:18,999
you on landing a job."

51
00:05:21,008 --> 00:05:23,990
Honey, they're singing the
closing song at the church.

52
00:05:24,014 --> 00:05:25,005
We's got time.

53
00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:28,982
Jeff's train's going to pick
me up at the water tank.

54
00:05:29,006 --> 00:05:32,029
But you know they's waiting
to see you before you go.

55
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:35,024
I sure hate to leave my gal.

56
00:06:00,004 --> 00:06:01,164
Would you hold my hat, honey?

57
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,991
Hello, Suzanna.

58
00:06:03,015 --> 00:06:04,002
Hello, Brutus.

59
00:06:04,026 --> 00:06:05,992
- Hello, brother.
- How you doing?

60
00:06:06,016 --> 00:06:07,016
Fine, thank you.

61
00:07:14,014 --> 00:07:15,005
There's your train, son.

62
00:07:15,029 --> 00:07:17,001
Goodbye, folks.

63
00:07:17,025 --> 00:07:18,978
Goodbye, brother.

64
00:07:19,002 --> 00:07:19,978
Take care of yourself.

65
00:07:20,002 --> 00:07:21,003
Goodbye!

66
00:07:24,012 --> 00:07:25,012
Goodbye, Mama.

67
00:07:28,025 --> 00:07:30,008
Goodbye,

68
00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:55,004
Here she is.

69
00:07:55,028 --> 00:07:56,002
Come on, Jones.

70
00:07:56,026 --> 00:07:57,004
Here's my buddy.

71
00:07:57,028 --> 00:07:58,004
Honey, this is Jeff.

72
00:07:58,028 --> 00:07:59,981
Hello, sister.

73
00:08:00,005 --> 00:08:00,985
Make tracks, bo, cause
we's riding right now.

74
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:02,013
Come on. - All right.

75
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:06,997
But this is too much!

76
00:08:07,021 --> 00:08:08,995
You is coming back, ain't you?

77
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:10,028
Oh, sure I's coming back.

78
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,999
You just get yourself a
new dress with this, honey.

79
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:12,997
You know, a red one.

80
00:08:13,021 --> 00:08:14,980
That's your style.

81
00:08:15,004 --> 00:08:16,999
And take care of yourself
until I come back, now.

82
00:08:17,023 --> 00:08:18,004
Come on!

83
00:08:18,028 --> 00:08:19,982
All right, old boy.

84
00:08:20,006 --> 00:08:20,995
It's all right, honey.
Take care of yourself.

85
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:21,990
Don't worry.

86
00:08:22,014 --> 00:08:23,990
I'll be back very soon.

87
00:08:24,014 --> 00:08:25,028
Take care of yourself.

88
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,005
Goodbye, honey!

89
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:28,991
Goodbye

90
00:08:31,026 --> 00:08:33,003
Bye bye, honey!

91
00:08:33,027 --> 00:08:34,027
Bye bye!

92
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:46,000
Shine 'em, boy.

93
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:47,991
You done told 'em goodbye now.

94
00:08:48,015 --> 00:08:49,001
You going to stick to it?

95
00:08:49,025 --> 00:08:50,002
Sure, I is.

96
00:08:50,026 --> 00:08:53,982
Cause you big time from this on.

97
00:08:54,006 --> 00:08:54,994
Now, I suppose
you think you know

98
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:56,001
all there is about this job.

99
00:08:56,025 --> 00:08:57,979
Sure, didn't you
done instruct me?

100
00:08:58,003 --> 00:08:59,981
Oh, just the rudimentary.

101
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:02,983
Now we's going to take
up the higher education.

102
00:09:03,007 --> 00:09:03,997
Finances.

103
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:05,001
Yes, brother.

104
00:09:05,025 --> 00:09:06,001
And right here's
where I estimates

105
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:07,986
the profits for the run.

106
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:12,978
Now, if you brushes a dime
out of this, you's doing well.

107
00:09:13,002 --> 00:09:17,002
And number three here, boy,
that's good for a half.

108
00:09:17,026 --> 00:09:19,978
What about this one?

109
00:09:20,002 --> 00:09:21,002
Number five.

110
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:24,993
A whole section.

111
00:09:25,017 --> 00:09:28,990
That's a honeymoon couple.

112
00:09:29,014 --> 00:09:30,003
That's a natural.

113
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:33,978
If you plays your hand right,
it means the long green.

114
00:09:34,002 --> 00:09:34,983
Big money, eh?

115
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,003
That's what I want
to tell you about.

116
00:09:36,027 --> 00:09:38,980
You know, there's two kind of
women that rides the Pullman.

117
00:09:39,004 --> 00:09:41,994
There's the kind that says,
"Where you been, Porter?"

118
00:09:42,018 --> 00:09:43,994
That don't mean
nothing but a tip.

119
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:45,989
Then there's the
kind that sings out,

120
00:09:46,013 --> 00:09:47,994
"Hello there, Jack Johnson!"

121
00:09:48,018 --> 00:09:51,984
And boy, that means money.

122
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:52,990
The long green.

123
00:09:53,014 --> 00:09:53,999
Yeah.

124
00:09:54,023 --> 00:09:56,985
And I'm going to show
you where to spend it.

125
00:10:19,002 --> 00:10:21,004
Everybody, meet my friend
from South Carolina.

126
00:10:21,028 --> 00:10:22,004
Helen, meet Mr. Jones.

127
00:10:22,028 --> 00:10:24,985
Jones, meet Mr. Green.

128
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:27,000
Gee, that's very strong.

129
00:10:27,024 --> 00:10:28,000
Come here, Marcella.

130
00:10:28,024 --> 00:10:28,998
Meet Mr. Jones.

131
00:10:29,022 --> 00:10:30,979
This is Marcella, Jones.

132
00:10:31,003 --> 00:10:31,985
Hello, big boy.

133
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:33,990
I got your fish and
rice all ready for ya.

134
00:10:34,014 --> 00:10:35,001
You know, I'm from
South Carolina, myself.

135
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:36,989
You told me you
was from Georgia.

136
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:38,002
Told me Lynchburg.

137
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:39,999
Marcella sure had a busy ma.

138
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:43,000
She done born her in every
state south of the line.

139
00:10:43,024 --> 00:10:46,999
This is my New York home, bo,
and you'll always find me here.

140
00:10:47,023 --> 00:10:48,999
Oh, Marcella, where's Undine?

141
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,979
I don't know.

142
00:10:51,003 --> 00:10:53,005
She was around here somewhere.

143
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,986
Didn't know I was coming in, eh?

144
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:06,002
Honeying up to my gal, eh?

145
00:11:08,026 --> 00:11:09,987
Take it easy.

146
00:11:10,011 --> 00:11:10,988
Don't do that.

147
00:11:11,012 --> 00:11:11,985
Don't do that, son.

148
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:12,985
Not inside of my house.

149
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:14,986
You ain't gonna send me to jail.

150
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:15,982
Uh uh.

151
00:11:16,006 --> 00:11:18,029
Y'all go ahead and dance!

152
00:11:27,016 --> 00:11:29,028
There she is.

153
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,010
Undine, meet Mr. Jones.

154
00:11:37,015 --> 00:11:39,996
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Jones.

155
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:40,992
Wanna dance?

156
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:41,988
Sure.

157
00:11:42,012 --> 00:11:43,029
Go ahead.

158
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:46,008
You're my buddy, ain't ya?

159
00:11:57,027 --> 00:11:59,984
How you like the city, big boy?

160
00:12:00,008 --> 00:12:03,001
I like it fine now.

161
00:12:03,025 --> 00:12:04,993
Coming back soon?

162
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:07,998
Soon as the train'll bring me.

163
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:10,982
I'll be here.

164
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,990
Honey, I sure glad to see you.

165
00:13:04,014 --> 00:13:06,993
I get to missing you more and
more during these long runs.

166
00:13:07,017 --> 00:13:09,979
You know, you oughtn't ask
me to come here to meet you.

167
00:13:10,003 --> 00:13:10,999
I been afraid.

168
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:12,979
Afraid a what?

169
00:13:13,003 --> 00:13:13,980
Um, you know.

170
00:13:14,004 --> 00:13:14,028
Jeff.

171
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,991
He's a bad actor over me.

172
00:13:17,015 --> 00:13:18,990
Well, you ain't got
nothing to be afraid of.

173
00:13:19,014 --> 00:13:22,986
I can handle that
little two-bits porter.

174
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,979
You oughta throw
him over, anyhow.

175
00:13:26,003 --> 00:13:27,995
Then it'll be just you and me.

176
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,980
Sometimes I wonders.

177
00:13:30,004 --> 00:13:31,029
Wonders what?

178
00:13:32,001 --> 00:13:33,994
If we gonna last.

179
00:13:34,018 --> 00:13:36,985
You ain't got nothing
to worry about, honey.

180
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:37,999
But you ain't heard
the good news yet.

181
00:13:38,023 --> 00:13:41,004
I been transferred to the
president's private car.

182
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,000
Aw, that ain't nothin'.

183
00:13:43,024 --> 00:13:45,979
Why, Jeff said you don't
make no tips on that job.

184
00:13:46,003 --> 00:13:47,000
That's why he didn't take it.

185
00:13:47,024 --> 00:13:48,028
There you are.

186
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:49,987
That's the difference
between me and Jeff.

187
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:51,991
He can't see no
bigger than two bits.

188
00:13:52,015 --> 00:13:53,028
Me?

189
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,981
Why, I just be steppin' to my
own class on that private car.

190
00:14:04,026 --> 00:14:07,005
Harrington, if
there is no leak,

191
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:08,992
we stand to clean up millions.

192
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:09,996
That's the idea.

193
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,991
Good night.

194
00:14:11,015 --> 00:14:11,985
Good night.

195
00:14:12,009 --> 00:14:12,985
Good night, Jones.

196
00:14:13,009 --> 00:14:14,014
Good night, sir.

197
00:14:21,002 --> 00:14:22,005
Anything on your mind, Jones?

198
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:25,988
I's awful worried
about that merger.

199
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:29,993
Sure would be bad for
us if that news got out.

200
00:14:30,017 --> 00:14:31,029
Us?

201
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:33,987
Hm.

202
00:14:34,011 --> 00:14:35,981
How long have you
been with me, Jones?

203
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:36,993
Six weeks, sir.

204
00:14:37,017 --> 00:14:38,992
Learning fast Jones.

205
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:42,978
Almost too fast.

206
00:14:43,002 --> 00:14:44,028
Got any money, Jones?

207
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,981
I got about $300 in the bank.

208
00:14:47,005 --> 00:14:47,984
All right.

209
00:14:48,008 --> 00:14:49,987
You're in the pool for $300.

210
00:14:50,011 --> 00:14:51,981
Thank you, sir.

211
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:54,984
And Jones, I would
rather you didn't

212
00:14:55,008 --> 00:14:57,004
leave the car until Sunday.

213
00:14:57,028 --> 00:14:58,989
Two days solitary.

214
00:14:59,013 --> 00:15:01,995
But it'll be worth it, right?

215
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:03,984
Yes, sir.

216
00:15:04,008 --> 00:15:05,993
And Jones, when we
get back to New York,

217
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:09,999
it might be a good idea for
you to go back on your old run.

218
00:15:10,023 --> 00:15:14,982
There's more room for
big men in Georgia.

219
00:15:15,006 --> 00:15:16,006
Yes, sir.

220
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:21,029
Boy, you sure was born
to wear that oyster front.

221
00:15:22,001 --> 00:15:23,982
Where'd you get such a good fit?

222
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,005
Well, the boss
and me talk it over.

223
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:27,982
And he sent me to his tailor.

224
00:15:28,006 --> 00:15:30,000
He said, Jones, you got a
position to live up to now.

225
00:15:30,024 --> 00:15:33,004
And you can't afford to be
careless in your attire.

226
00:15:33,028 --> 00:15:35,994
You and Mr. Harrington
must be getting mighty thick.

227
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,986
Well, we just pulled off
a little deal together.

228
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:39,981
I gave him some valuable advice.

229
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,978
And he said, Jones,
you're learning fast.

230
00:15:43,002 --> 00:15:43,981
You're getting big.

231
00:15:44,005 --> 00:15:45,994
Then he takes me
into partnership.

232
00:15:46,018 --> 00:15:47,988
But ain't you going back
on the Pullman no more?

233
00:15:48,012 --> 00:15:49,999
Oh, I'll stick by the
job for a few more runs.

234
00:15:50,023 --> 00:15:51,998
But things don't seem
to be going quite

235
00:15:52,022 --> 00:15:53,980
right on that old run of mine.

236
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:54,998
And the boss asked me
to drop down that way,

237
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:56,005
straighten them out.

238
00:15:56,029 --> 00:15:58,005
Well, I guess since
you'll be down that way,

239
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:00,995
you'll probably drop
in the White House.

240
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:02,019
Well, that's an idea.

241
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,985
Look here, what are
you trying to do?

242
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:07,027
Kid me? - Me?

243
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Kid you?

244
00:16:08,024 --> 00:16:09,986
Boy, you're a scream.

245
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,979
"Jones.

246
00:16:12,003 --> 00:16:12,980
You're gettin' big.

247
00:16:13,004 --> 00:16:13,981
You're learnin' fast.

248
00:16:14,005 --> 00:16:16,004
Then he takes me
into partnership."

249
00:16:16,028 --> 00:16:17,981
Come clean, big boy.

250
00:16:18,005 --> 00:16:19,994
Where'd you get that
money, in a crap game?

251
00:16:20,018 --> 00:16:21,005
Go laugh some more.

252
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:23,028
You done laughed yourself
right off of my payroll.

253
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,994
Oh, honey, sweetheart,
I didn't mean it.

254
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,989
I was only kidding.

255
00:16:28,013 --> 00:16:29,981
No, you's too
funny to live with.

256
00:16:30,005 --> 00:16:31,982
Any woman's baggage what
gets heavier and heavier

257
00:16:32,006 --> 00:16:32,992
the longer you totes 'em.

258
00:16:33,016 --> 00:16:36,981
You got to change 'em
to keep traveling light.

259
00:16:37,005 --> 00:16:38,982
Here's $40, and goodbye.

260
00:16:39,006 --> 00:16:40,982
So you was all set to do
this before you come in, eh?

261
00:16:41,006 --> 00:16:41,028
Through is through.

262
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:42,985
You heard me.

263
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:44,982
And you can go back to Jeff.

264
00:16:45,006 --> 00:16:47,002
He still thinks there ain't
nobody like his Undine.

265
00:16:47,026 --> 00:16:48,983
Yeah.

266
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:49,998
Well, you ain't the first
man that's gone down and out

267
00:16:50,022 --> 00:16:52,029
thinking everybody was a fool.

268
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:58,993
I got eyes, even if Jeff ain't.

269
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:02,028
And you can tell that polecat
Belle La Due, if she wants

270
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,990
to keep on trying
to look like Garbo,

271
00:17:05,014 --> 00:17:07,001
she better stay out of my way.

272
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:08,025
Slim, sister!

273
00:17:59,001 --> 00:18:00,983
Well, if it ain't the old
big timer in from the West.

274
00:18:01,007 --> 00:18:01,998
Hello, Jeff.

275
00:18:02,022 --> 00:18:04,006
Hello, Undine.

276
00:18:14,003 --> 00:18:16,029
Undine, meet Miss La Due.

277
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:19,004
I've known Belle since before
she straightened her hair

278
00:18:19,028 --> 00:18:20,999
and when she went with Johnson.

279
00:18:21,023 --> 00:18:22,985
Where is he now, Belle?

280
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:23,986
Still in jail?

281
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,990
Undine, where is your manners?

282
00:18:26,014 --> 00:18:27,991
I'm just trying to
talk so that the polecat

283
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:29,979
can understand me.

284
00:18:30,003 --> 00:18:30,979
Come on, baby.

285
00:18:31,003 --> 00:18:32,003
Let's dance.

286
00:18:36,009 --> 00:18:37,998
What's the matter with
you tonight, Undine.

287
00:18:38,022 --> 00:18:40,981
Now, I don't like you
acting sore to my pal.

288
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:41,005
Your pal.

289
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:42,000
Yeah.

290
00:18:42,024 --> 00:18:43,983
Don't make me laugh.

291
00:18:44,007 --> 00:18:45,001
Why, he's been biting you
in the back for a year.

292
00:18:45,025 --> 00:18:46,979
What do you mean?

293
00:18:47,003 --> 00:18:47,999
I mean, when I get
finished with Belle,

294
00:18:48,023 --> 00:18:50,017
he ain't gonna have
much left to love.

295
00:18:55,015 --> 00:18:56,029
Oh, you dirty...

296
00:19:02,128 --> 00:19:03,004
Hey you!

297
00:19:03,028 --> 00:19:04,028
Stop that!

298
00:19:09,001 --> 00:19:10,001
Come on.

299
00:19:13,024 --> 00:19:14,024
I's travelling light.

300
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,016
Number
eight's his point.

301
00:19:48,002 --> 00:19:48,987
Come on, you nits.

302
00:19:49,011 --> 00:19:49,990
Get back and
give me room, will ya?

303
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:51,002
What's the matter, Jeff?

304
00:19:51,026 --> 00:19:52,005
I never saw you in such a mood.

305
00:19:52,029 --> 00:19:53,982
Never mind the lip.

306
00:19:54,006 --> 00:19:54,987
Get these nits back
away from the table.

307
00:19:55,011 --> 00:19:55,988
Hey, fellas, come on.
Back up.

308
00:19:56,012 --> 00:19:57,001
Give him a chance.

309
00:19:57,025 --> 00:19:58,029
We ain't in his way.

310
00:19:59,001 --> 00:19:59,001
Shoot!

311
00:19:59,025 --> 00:19:59,996
Hah!

312
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:00,998
On the line, you nits.

313
00:20:01,022 --> 00:20:03,992
Eighter from Decatur.

314
00:20:04,016 --> 00:20:04,986
Beaver dice.

315
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:05,982
Big dick.

316
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:06,982
Who is that singing?

317
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:07,993
Is that you, Lily pie?

318
00:20:08,017 --> 00:20:09,003
Yes.

319
00:20:09,027 --> 00:20:12,004
Well if you can't sing no
better than that, shut up.

320
00:20:12,028 --> 00:20:14,996
Jeff's gal must've
sold him down.

321
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,988
Yes, what's eatin' you, Jeff?

322
00:20:17,012 --> 00:20:19,992
You been trying to ride somebody
ever since you come in here.

323
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:21,996
Ah, woman, dry up.

324
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:26,001
Let 'em roll.

325
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,003
Gentleman says you've faded.

326
00:20:27,027 --> 00:20:28,002
Let 'em roll.

327
00:20:28,026 --> 00:20:29,003
Push over, little tender.

328
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:33,988
Let a man have elbow room.

329
00:20:34,012 --> 00:20:36,992
$20 they don't.

330
00:20:37,016 --> 00:20:38,016
$20 to do.

331
00:20:41,011 --> 00:20:43,008
Shake, rub, and roll
'em here, brother.

332
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:46,003
Hot dice.

333
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:46,994
Hah!

334
00:20:47,018 --> 00:20:48,989
The man went away.

335
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:49,990
Here, Jones.

336
00:20:50,014 --> 00:20:50,992
Give me a shooter
there, somebody.

337
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:51,987
Come on, give me a shooter.

338
00:20:52,011 --> 00:20:53,002
15 cents I shoot.

339
00:20:53,026 --> 00:20:55,003
Man, take that
chicken feed off of here

340
00:20:55,027 --> 00:20:56,982
and play it on the line.

341
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:57,998
Come on, give me
a shooter there.

342
00:20:58,022 --> 00:20:59,978
Big money talk.

343
00:21:00,002 --> 00:21:00,979
What you shooting, Mr. Jones?
- Put in a nickel.

344
00:21:01,003 --> 00:21:01,978
Put in a nickel, he goes!

345
00:21:02,002 --> 00:21:02,982
I... I got the nickel.

346
00:21:03,006 --> 00:21:03,989
You can't bet with
it in your hand.

347
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:04,989
Put it on the wood.
- Let him shoot.

348
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:05,984
Let him roll.

349
00:21:06,008 --> 00:21:06,029
He's faded.

350
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:07,003
Hold my hat, nit.

351
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:09,998
Hah.

352
00:21:10,022 --> 00:21:11,000
Great balls of fire.

353
00:21:11,024 --> 00:21:12,979
Big dick.
Don't get nervous, boy.

354
00:21:13,003 --> 00:21:13,004
You can back it.

355
00:21:13,028 --> 00:21:14,028
Let me have it.

356
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:15,980
Six-four me, dice.

357
00:21:16,004 --> 00:21:16,985
11.

358
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,003
Who wants any part
of these four sawbucks?

359
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:19,003
I makes my point.

360
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,989
Let the dice bring on misery.

361
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,978
Let him hear 'em chatter.

362

Six-ace.

364
00:21:25,005 --> 00:21:25,993
The man went away.

365
00:21:26,017 --> 00:21:27,978
You know, why don't
you get up off the table?

366
00:21:28,002 --> 00:21:28,978
Can't you see your coat
sleeve's stopping my dice?

367
00:21:29,002 --> 00:21:29,980
What are you talking about?

368
00:21:30,004 --> 00:21:30,978
Can't I make a bet?

369
00:21:31,002 --> 00:21:32,001
Here, old boy, you win a dime.

00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:33,028

00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:36,985
85 cents I shoot.

374
00:21:37,009 --> 00:21:37,995
85 cents the lady shoots.

00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:38,998

376
00:21:39,022 --> 00:21:39,998
Your cushions favor me.

00:21:40,022 --> 00:21:40,996

378
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,000
Twenty the dice do.

379
00:21:42,024 --> 00:21:43,984
Let the hussy sprain her wrist.

380
00:21:44,008 --> 00:21:45,005

The lady goes.

385
00:21:53,001 --> 00:21:53,991
Say, Stumpy, were
you on me then?

386
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:55,000
Yeah, I was.

387
00:21:55,024 --> 00:21:56,985
Didn't I tell you
never to get on my bets?

388
00:21:57,009 --> 00:21:59,985
Yeah, but honey,
this is a crap game.

389
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:01,005

Let 'em roll.

396
00:22:08,025 --> 00:22:10,023
$80 the dice do.

397
00:22:14,001 --> 00:22:16,002
$160 they don't.

398
00:22:21,009 --> 00:22:21,995
They do.

399
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:24,983

a crap game today.

400
00:22:25,007 --> 00:22:27,001

00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:34,000
Eleven, natural.

406
00:22:34,024 --> 00:22:35,000
What's the matter?

407
00:22:35,024 --> 00:22:36,025
Put the dice down.

408
00:22:46,025 --> 00:22:47,996
Crooked, huh?

409
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,982
Well, if they is crooked,
they stands just like him.

410
00:22:51,006 --> 00:22:53,006
And here's where I

412
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:40,005

00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Open it up.

414
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:54,001
Open it up.

415
00:26:02,016 --> 00:26:03,979
Asleep, eh?

416
00:26:04,003 --> 00:26:06,007
Well, I'll learn
him how to run away.

417
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:11,978
Wake him up.

418
00:26:12,002 --> 00:26:15,998
If I lay my hands on that boy,
the Lord will strike me dead.

419
00:26:16,022 --> 00:26:18,007
Won't take orders, eh?

420
00:26:58,005 --> 00:26:59,983
Dump it, old boy.

421
00:27:00,007 --> 00:27:02,980

422
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:26,981

Let me in, quick.

424
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:31,994
Dolly, honey, you hear me?

425
00:27:34,003 --> 00:27:35,003

426
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:41,997
Brutus, honey.

427
00:27:42,021 --> 00:27:43,023
Let me in, quick.

428
00:27:53,014 --> 00:27:56,987
Oh, Lord, I'm glad to see you.

429
00:27:57,011 --> 00:27:57,996
Oh, but you's in trouble.

430
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,982
Listen, Dolly, you
got to move fast.

431
00:28:00,006 --> 00:28:02,086
Get me a file, a change of
clothes, especially shoes.

432
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,991
But you's cut!

433
00:28:07,015 --> 00:28:07,990
Hurry, honey.

434
00:28:08,014 --> 00:28:09,214
I've got to leave the country.

435
00:28:53,003 --> 00:28:54,989
Say, where is this
tub stopping next?

436
00:28:55,013 --> 00:28:56,982
Kingston.

437
00:28:57,006 --> 00:28:58,995
Get there tomorrow.

438
00:28:59,019 --> 00:29:01,005
Ain't we stopping on these
little islands on the way?

439
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:02,983
Boy, this no local.

440
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,987
This running express.

441
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:06,985
Kingston.

442
00:29:07,009 --> 00:29:08,979
Quite a big city, eh?

443
00:29:09,003 --> 00:29:09,029
Now you're shouting.

444
00:29:10,001 --> 00:29:11,980
They got everything.

445
00:29:12,004 --> 00:29:14,982
Dancehalls, gals.

446
00:29:15,006 --> 00:29:15,988
They got telegraph?

447
00:29:16,012 --> 00:29:17,983
Cable, you mean, big boy?

448
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:19,018
Sure, they got cable.

449
00:29:23,016 --> 00:29:24,992
What's that little
island with the white port

450
00:29:25,016 --> 00:29:26,995
we've been coming
on this afternoon?

451
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:28,999
That's one of them there
little nigger islands.

452
00:29:29,023 --> 00:29:30,985
But nobody bother go that place.

453
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:33,984
Ain't nothing there but trouble.

454
00:29:34,008 --> 00:29:35,999
Trouble is my buddy.

455
00:29:36,023 --> 00:29:37,984
Say, bo, watch my door.

456
00:29:38,008 --> 00:29:38,990
I ain't gonna be long.

457
00:29:39,014 --> 00:29:40,014
OK.

458
00:29:58,018 --> 00:30:00,015
Trouble, here I come.

459
00:30:47,024 --> 00:30:48,000
Who there?

460
00:30:48,024 --> 00:30:48,995
Who that?

461
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:49,990
What you want, buddy?

462
00:30:51,026 --> 00:30:52,991
All right, all right.

463
00:30:53,015 --> 00:30:55,000
I'm coming.

464
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,997
Your Highness, Mr. Smithers
is waiting to see you.

465
00:31:40,021 --> 00:31:41,021
Show the gentleman in.

466
00:31:45,007 --> 00:31:46,028
Send Mr. Smithers in.

467
00:31:59,022 --> 00:32:01,982
Well, your excellency,
the good has come.

468
00:32:02,006 --> 00:32:03,994
And I brought you a few samples.

469
00:32:04,018 --> 00:32:06,994
First class, just
like I said they'd be.

470
00:32:07,018 --> 00:32:09,029
Now, here's the figures.

471
00:32:10,001 --> 00:32:11,993
$400 cash for the lot.

472
00:32:12,017 --> 00:32:14,029
Oh no, I got the
contract this time.

473
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:17,978
The contract, he said, $300.

474
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:18,984
Contract?

475
00:32:19,008 --> 00:32:20,978
Well, that's just
the blooming point.

476
00:32:21,002 --> 00:32:26,999
You see, uh, here it says,
"except for an act of God."

477
00:32:27,023 --> 00:32:29,981
Now, then, there ain't the
like of that consignment

478
00:32:30,005 --> 00:32:31,001
within 300 miles.

479
00:32:31,025 --> 00:32:34,028
And the next boat don't
get here for two months.

480
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,003
Now, ain't that an act
of God, so help me?

481
00:32:54,008 --> 00:32:55,005
Where you get that trash from?

482
00:32:55,029 --> 00:32:56,982
On the beach.

483
00:32:57,006 --> 00:32:57,999
Where you come from?

484
00:32:58,023 --> 00:33:00,999
Come to make trouble on
my island, filthy swine.

485
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:04,994
Lock him up and throw him
on the first boat out.

486
00:33:10,026 --> 00:33:12,000
I'll take this blooming
nigger off your hands

487
00:33:12,024 --> 00:33:14,982
for you, your highness.

488
00:33:15,006 --> 00:33:16,000
Here.

489
00:33:16,024 --> 00:33:19,002
Here, five silver dollars for
him, lock, stock, and barrel.

490
00:33:19,026 --> 00:33:20,000
What do you say, now?

491
00:33:20,024 --> 00:33:21,991
Is it a trade?

492
00:33:22,015 --> 00:33:23,015
Good.

493
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:29,997
Here, wait a minute.

494
00:33:30,021 --> 00:33:30,991
Here.

495
00:33:31,015 --> 00:33:31,990
Bring him here.

496
00:33:32,014 --> 00:33:34,003
I want to have a talk with him.

497
00:33:34,027 --> 00:33:36,022
That's all right,
he belongs to me.

498
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,980
So that's what it
is, my lad, eh?

499
00:33:46,004 --> 00:33:48,028
What they calls in the
States a bad nigger, eh?

500
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,986
A killer, what?

501
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,992
With the law on your
trail and the blooming

502
00:33:52,016 --> 00:33:53,990
gallows waiting for you
around the next corner, what?

503
00:33:54,014 --> 00:33:55,984
Look here, white man.

504
00:33:56,008 --> 00:33:57,028
I comes and I goes.

505
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,029
And that's my business.

506
00:34:00,007 --> 00:34:01,987
Oh, that's the kind
of a nigger you are, eh?

507
00:34:02,011 --> 00:34:03,988
Not afraid to stand
right up to your betters

508
00:34:04,012 --> 00:34:05,997
and tell them what's what?

509
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:08,501
You wouldn't be afraid of a bit
of a fight, neither, would you?

510
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,984
When I fights,
there's something in it.

511
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:12,288
I never fight on an empty belly.

512
00:34:13,001 --> 00:34:14,983
Yeah, well supposing
your belly was full

513
00:34:15,007 --> 00:34:16,991
and you had a chance to
get back at the stinking

514
00:34:17,015 --> 00:34:17,997
heathen what threw you out?

515
00:34:18,021 --> 00:34:19,004
What would you say then?

516
00:34:19,028 --> 00:34:20,982
No use talking, white man.

517
00:34:21,006 --> 00:34:21,986
All right.

518
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,001
Now, you get your
rum and your eats.

519
00:34:24,025 --> 00:34:27,982
But you don't get a stinking
penny, because I'm a trader,

520
00:34:28,006 --> 00:34:28,982
see?

521
00:34:29,006 --> 00:34:29,990
I ain't no bloomin' missionary.

522
00:34:30,014 --> 00:34:32,000
And if anybody worries
you, you just tell them

523
00:34:32,024 --> 00:34:33,005
you belong to Mr. Smithers.

524
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,027
I belongs to Mr. Smithers.

525
00:34:40,027 --> 00:34:40,998
What's that?

526
00:34:41,022 --> 00:34:42,979
Ginger.

527
00:34:43,003 --> 00:34:43,004
What's that?

528
00:34:44,022 --> 00:34:44,994
What's that?

529
00:34:45,018 --> 00:34:45,989
Cocoa.

530
00:34:46,013 --> 00:34:46,984
What's that?

531
00:34:47,008 --> 00:34:47,998
- Ginger.
- Ginger?

532
00:34:48,022 --> 00:34:48,993
What's that?

533
00:34:49,017 --> 00:34:49,988
Coffee.

534
00:34:50,012 --> 00:34:50,982
Coffee, ging...

535
00:34:52,012 --> 00:34:53,004
Well, this ain't regular.

536
00:34:53,028 --> 00:34:54,993
But maybe the dice will do.

537
00:34:55,017 --> 00:34:57,995
Now, they goes first to the
gentleman with the Rolls Royce.

538
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:00,992
All right, talk to him, bo.

539
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:01,997
What I say?

540
00:35:02,021 --> 00:35:03,994
Fever in the South.

541
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,004
Fever south.

542
00:35:05,028 --> 00:35:06,988
Eighter from Decatur.

543
00:35:07,012 --> 00:35:07,998
Eighter from cater.

544
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:08,994
Big dick.

545
00:35:09,018 --> 00:35:10,000
- Big dick.
- Hah!

546
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:10,993
Hah.

547
00:35:11,017 --> 00:35:11,995
Well, shoot, man.

548
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:14,999
Don't you know
"hah" means shoot?

549
00:35:15,023 --> 00:35:19,979
Boy, the whole pile goes to the
gentleman with the Rolls Royce.

550
00:35:20,003 --> 00:35:21,978
Well, all right.

551
00:35:22,002 --> 00:35:23,000
Gather it in.

552
00:35:23,024 --> 00:35:24,024
All yours, buddy.

553
00:35:27,012 --> 00:35:28,984
I'll be dressed up
here in a minute.

554
00:35:29,008 --> 00:35:30,005
I'm going after that hat.

555
00:35:30,029 --> 00:35:31,005
And I'm rogue.

556
00:35:31,029 --> 00:35:31,998
Natural.

557
00:35:32,022 --> 00:35:33,988
Let me have it boy.

558
00:35:34,012 --> 00:35:34,998
Now, Quacko, what do you say?

559
00:35:35,022 --> 00:35:37,981
This whole pile to
get that Rolls Royce.

560
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:38,028
Hah.

561
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,984
The house is rolling.

562
00:35:40,008 --> 00:35:41,979
Now, come on, you
galloping dominoes.

563
00:35:42,003 --> 00:35:44,001
Come home to papa,
and let 'er ride.

564
00:35:44,025 --> 00:35:44,999
Hah!

565
00:35:45,023 --> 00:35:47,979
Nine is the gentleman's point.

566
00:35:48,003 --> 00:35:49,985
Come on, eighter from Decatur.

567
00:35:50,009 --> 00:35:50,980
Come on.

568
00:35:51,004 --> 00:35:51,982
Hah!

569
00:35:52,006 --> 00:35:52,990
Even us out, baby.

570
00:35:53,014 --> 00:35:53,987
Hah!

571
00:35:54,011 --> 00:35:56,982
The gentleman made his point.

572
00:35:57,006 --> 00:35:58,982
Ah, the team is mine, Quacko.

573
00:35:59,006 --> 00:35:59,984
That's tough luck.

574
00:36:00,008 --> 00:36:01,288
Better luck next Saturday night.

575
00:36:05,013 --> 00:36:06,028
Me play woman for oxen.

576
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Oh, no.

577
00:36:07,024 --> 00:36:07,997
Women is women.

578
00:36:08,021 --> 00:36:09,997
And Brutus Jones is through.

579
00:36:10,021 --> 00:36:12,002
Well, I'll see you
boys next week.

580
00:36:12,026 --> 00:36:15,002
Look 'em over.

581
00:36:15,026 --> 00:36:16,990
So long, Quacko.

582
00:36:17,014 --> 00:36:18,014
I'll see you later.

583
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,026
I wonder what the blazes
is keeping that black ape.

584
00:36:48,012 --> 00:36:48,983
Whoa.

585
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:49,983
Boy.

586
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:50,997
Whoa.

587
00:36:59,012 --> 00:37:00,999
Here, where do you
think you're going?

588
00:37:01,023 --> 00:37:02,996
Oh, good morning, Mr. Smithers.

589
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,004
You works in here.

590
00:37:04,028 --> 00:37:10,983
Well, to tell you the
truth, Mr. Smithers,

591
00:37:11,007 --> 00:37:12,999
the boys back in the bush
seems to like my methods.

592
00:37:13,023 --> 00:37:15,001
And I's figuring to
open up a little tradin'

593
00:37:15,025 --> 00:37:18,004
business next door here.

594
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:20,984
Cut my bleedin'
throat, would you?

595
00:37:21,008 --> 00:37:23,002
After all I've
done for you, too.

596
00:37:23,026 --> 00:37:24,989
Is that your idea of gratitude?

597
00:37:25,013 --> 00:37:28,005
Well, I's always ready
to listen to reason.

598
00:37:28,029 --> 00:37:31,005
And while I'm unloading, if
I was to hear anybody say

599
00:37:31,029 --> 00:37:34,006
something about a partnership...

600
00:37:47,021 --> 00:37:51,994
Coconut, pineapple,
finefat chicken, all ready

601
00:37:52,018 --> 00:37:53,979
for the tooth.

602
00:37:54,003 --> 00:37:57,990
Raisins and new corn, coconut,
pineapple, great big chicken,

603
00:37:58,014 --> 00:37:59,000
all ready for the tooth.

604
00:37:59,024 --> 00:38:03,014
Pineapple, big chicken
ready for the tooth.

605
00:38:22,007 --> 00:38:23,005
How do you do, Mr. Smithers?
How have you been?

606
00:38:23,029 --> 00:38:24,001
I'm sure glad to see you.

607
00:38:24,025 --> 00:38:25,029
How do you do?

608
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:27,601
Why don't you come in
and pay your bills?

609
00:38:34,008 --> 00:38:37,005
You know, everytime I rides
up here through that jungle

610
00:38:37,029 --> 00:38:39,995
it gives me the creeps.

611
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:42,984
Say, you notice they
shut the gates after us?

612
00:38:43,008 --> 00:38:47,985
Looka here, white man,
is your nerve slippin'?

613
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:49,023
Well, I don't like it.

614
00:38:53,018 --> 00:38:54,996
If you had to recruit
an army for him,

615
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,978
why did you have to
get such big blokes?

616
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,003
Yes, them is fine niggers.

617
00:38:59,027 --> 00:39:01,029
I bet you they knows a
man when they sees one.

618
00:39:02,001 --> 00:39:02,987
Well, if there's
any trouble, you've

619
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:04,002
only got yourself to blame.

620
00:39:04,026 --> 00:39:07,000
Saluting him and calling
him General and...

621
00:39:07,024 --> 00:39:08,986
Well, now I tell
you, Mr. Smithers.

622
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:10,993
If there's any trouble, you
just leave the General to me.

623
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:13,016
Us niggers understand
each other.

624
00:39:16,005 --> 00:39:17,016
Tell him Mr. Smithers.

625
00:39:19,029 --> 00:39:20,991
You know, you gotta
be diplomatic.

626
00:39:21,015 --> 00:39:22,003
Take it easy.

627
00:39:25,004 --> 00:39:25,996
Mr. Smithers to
see you, excellency.

628
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,020
Show the gentleman in.

629
00:39:41,008 --> 00:39:44,982
Well, good day to
you, your majesty.

630
00:39:45,006 --> 00:39:45,996
Well, well.

631
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,986
Top hole, eh?

632
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:48,998
Top hole.

633
00:39:49,022 --> 00:39:51,998
As fine a body of men as
ever I clapped me peepers on.

634
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:52,997
Eh, what, Jones?

635
00:39:53,021 --> 00:39:53,998
Right.

636
00:39:54,022 --> 00:39:56,984
Yeah, and well farmed, if I says

637
00:39:57,008 --> 00:39:57,998
it myself as fitted 'em out.

638
00:39:58,022 --> 00:39:58,993
Eh?

639
00:39:59,017 --> 00:39:59,998
What?

640
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,998
Well, General, you
got a swell army.

641
00:40:02,022 --> 00:40:05,002
And I reckons when you figure
how little it's costing you,

642
00:40:05,026 --> 00:40:08,988
makes you feel mighty proud.

643
00:40:09,012 --> 00:40:11,006
Send in the treasurer.

644
00:40:20,029 --> 00:40:22,029
This my treasurer.

645
00:40:23,001 --> 00:40:23,990
Tell the General the truth now.

646
00:40:24,014 --> 00:40:25,134
Does you know how to figure?

647
00:40:26,001 --> 00:40:27,990
Yes, your highness.

648
00:40:28,014 --> 00:40:29,989
Now, you see, I got a figure.

649
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:31,016
Produce the contract.

650
00:40:35,027 --> 00:40:36,981
Your bill, Mr. Smithers.

651
00:40:37,005 --> 00:40:39,005
Yeah, well, here you
are, your excellency.

652
00:40:39,029 --> 00:40:42,980
Now, then, there was
100 uniforms at $5.

653
00:40:43,004 --> 00:40:44,003
It's $1,000.

654
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:47,978
It was 100 rifles at $5, $1,000.

655
00:40:48,002 --> 00:40:48,994
One cannon was $500.

656
00:40:49,018 --> 00:40:57,018
And the ammuni... well, it adds
up to $4,000, your excellency.

657
00:40:58,009 --> 00:40:59,249
What does the treasurer report?

658
00:41:04,017 --> 00:41:08,985
It seems to me that there
might be a little error.

659
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:10,981
Uh, well, here... here,
let me look at it.

660
00:41:11,005 --> 00:41:12,981
Yeah, we all make
mistakes now and again.

661
00:41:13,005 --> 00:41:13,989
Yes, there is a mistake.

662
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,990
I seen it all along.

663
00:41:16,014 --> 00:41:20,997
It's $5,000.

664
00:41:21,021 --> 00:41:22,980
There you is, cap'n.

665
00:41:23,004 --> 00:41:24,524
Check that off and
tell it to the boss.

666
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:35,028
Fire.

667
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,984
[LAUGHTER

668
00:41:38,008 --> 00:41:38,980
Fire again.

669
00:41:39,004 --> 00:41:39,994
Plenty of guns.

670
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:45,011
Don't you all knows
I's got a charm?

671
00:41:50,001 --> 00:41:53,009
Takes a silver bullet
to kill Brutus Jones.

672
00:41:59,021 --> 00:42:02,986
My turn now, General.

673
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:03,990
Company.

674
00:42:04,014 --> 00:42:06,980
Attention!

675
00:42:07,004 --> 00:42:10,978
Take this bush nigger and
throw him out of here.

676
00:42:11,002 --> 00:42:13,996
I'm boss here now.

677
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:18,996
All of you, get out
of here and wait.

678
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:23,022
Them what I wants to stay
will hear from me in an hour.

679
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,994
Smithers, you wait.

680
00:42:30,018 --> 00:42:33,993
I wants to confer with you.

681
00:42:34,017 --> 00:42:38,028
Well, blimey if you
ain't pulled it off.

682
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,989
You have got a nerve.

683
00:42:40,013 --> 00:42:41,989
Nerve and brain.

684
00:42:42,013 --> 00:42:44,978
I calls it stinking
luck, having that nigger

685
00:42:45,002 --> 00:42:46,004
miss you twice at 10 feet.

686
00:42:46,028 --> 00:42:47,028
Pick up that gun.

687
00:42:51,019 --> 00:42:52,019
Break it.

688
00:42:58,012 --> 00:42:59,002
Blanks.

689
00:42:59,026 --> 00:43:00,984
Blimey, how...

690
00:43:01,008 --> 00:43:01,999
You remember when Quacko
got drunk in town last night

691
00:43:02,023 --> 00:43:05,000
and I takes care of his
gun while he sleeps it off?

692
00:43:05,024 --> 00:43:07,012
Well, that's what I call brains.

693
00:43:12,003 --> 00:43:12,994
Whew.

694
00:43:13,018 --> 00:43:15,994
This place smells more like a
chain gang dump than a palace.

695
00:43:16,018 --> 00:43:18,005
Say, Smithers, how
you likes the contract

696
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:20,002
for doing this dump over?

697
00:43:20,026 --> 00:43:21,982
Now you're talking.

698
00:43:22,006 --> 00:43:22,996
And don't make the
mistake of thinking you're

699
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,000
dealing with an
ignorant bush nigger.

700
00:43:25,024 --> 00:43:27,015
I gives you an
audience tomorrow.

701
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,986
Hey, and bring
along them fashion

702
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,984
sheets that I gets last summer.

703
00:43:36,008 --> 00:43:37,984
And then I want mirrors.

704
00:43:38,008 --> 00:43:38,991
Plenty of 'em.

705
00:43:39,015 --> 00:43:41,978
And remember, Smithers,
red's my color.

706
00:43:42,002 --> 00:43:45,008
I always had a
special taste for red.

707
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,002
Mr. President.

708
00:43:54,003 --> 00:43:54,978
No.

709
00:43:55,002 --> 00:43:56,985
King Brutus.

710
00:43:57,009 --> 00:44:00,979
No, somehow that don't
make enough noise.

711
00:44:01,003 --> 00:44:03,006
Smithers, cigarette.

712
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:12,010
Light.

713
00:44:33,019 --> 00:44:36,986
Smithers, you have
just had an audience

714
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,004
with the Emperor Jones.

715
00:45:15,015 --> 00:45:16,015
My sash.

716
00:45:20,007 --> 00:45:21,008
Watch that foot.

717
00:45:28,001 --> 00:45:29,010
Give me a drink.

718
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,023
My coat.

719
00:45:40,023 --> 00:45:41,994
Brush it off.

720
00:45:42,018 --> 00:45:47,003
Tell Smithers I'll
sees him here.

721
00:45:47,027 --> 00:45:48,028
Clear out, all of you.

722
00:45:52,027 --> 00:45:54,993
Your majesty.

723
00:45:55,017 --> 00:45:56,992
Well, Smithers, what's
on your mind this morning?

724
00:45:57,016 --> 00:45:59,005
Well, you remember what I
told you when you slapped that

725
00:45:59,029 --> 00:46:01,978
last tax on coffee,
that you were cutting

726
00:46:02,002 --> 00:46:02,985
your own bloomin' throat.

727
00:46:03,009 --> 00:46:03,979
Sure, I remember.

728
00:46:04,003 --> 00:46:05,978
What of it?

729
00:46:06,002 --> 00:46:08,000
There was a riot down
in the village last night.

730
00:46:08,024 --> 00:46:11,005
And your tax collector got
beaten up so his own mother

731
00:46:11,029 --> 00:46:11,998
wouldn't know him.

732
00:46:12,022 --> 00:46:13,000
That's old stuff.

733
00:46:13,024 --> 00:46:15,000
My army's got them
niggers already.

734
00:46:15,024 --> 00:46:17,985
And I'm going to get 'em
down before the whole court

735
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:18,990
this morning.

736
00:46:19,014 --> 00:46:20,000
They all need a lesson.

737
00:46:20,024 --> 00:46:21,991
Too late to give 'em
a lesson now, my lad.

738
00:46:22,015 --> 00:46:24,004
You've got 'em squeezed dry.

739
00:46:24,028 --> 00:46:25,984
Looka here.

740
00:46:26,008 --> 00:46:28,984
When I take this job,
what I tells you?

741
00:46:29,008 --> 00:46:32,028
I says, three years for
my cleanup, don't I?

742
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,004
Well, we's got six months to go.

743
00:46:35,028 --> 00:46:36,001
Them's my arrangements.

744
00:46:36,025 --> 00:46:38,989
And I ain't gonna change.

745
00:46:39,013 --> 00:46:42,004
I suppose you get your
money hiddent away safe, eh?

746
00:46:42,028 --> 00:46:44,001
I sure has.

747
00:46:44,025 --> 00:46:46,981
And it's banked in a foreign
land where there ain't

748
00:46:47,005 --> 00:46:49,980
no chain gangs and no
jim crow and nobody

749
00:46:50,004 --> 00:46:52,980
can't get it except me.

750
00:46:53,004 --> 00:46:56,984
In six months, I walks
out on this nigger circus.

751
00:46:57,008 --> 00:46:59,986
And from then on, I's top dog.

752
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:01,980
Top dog, eh?

753
00:47:02,004 --> 00:47:03,029
Looka here, white man.

754
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:05,984
There's little
stealing like you does,

755
00:47:06,008 --> 00:47:07,985
and there's big
stealing like I does.

756
00:47:08,009 --> 00:47:10,994
For little stealing, they get
you in jail sooner or later.

757
00:47:11,018 --> 00:47:12,002
But a big stealing?

758
00:47:12,026 --> 00:47:14,999
They makes you emperor
and puts you in a hall

759
00:47:15,023 --> 00:47:16,028
of fame when you croaks.

760
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,981
Well, all I know is
that it's a wise gambler

761
00:47:19,005 --> 00:47:20,002
that knows when to quit.

762
00:47:20,026 --> 00:47:21,992
Looka here, white man.

763
00:47:22,016 --> 00:47:25,003
You think I ain't still got
these niggers like that?

764
00:47:25,027 --> 00:47:28,000
You think when I crack the
whip, they don't jump through?

765
00:47:28,024 --> 00:47:32,020
All right, I shows you
I'll summon the court.

766
00:48:28,011 --> 00:48:30,029
His majesty is on the throne.

767
00:48:31,001 --> 00:48:32,001
Summon the court.

768
00:48:42,016 --> 00:48:45,018
Archduke and
Duchess of Manhattan.

769
00:48:54,009 --> 00:48:56,026
Marquis and
Marchioness of Newark.

770
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:03,027
Marquis and Marchioness
of Baton Rouge.

771
00:49:08,022 --> 00:49:11,008
Lord and Lady of Baltimore.

772
00:49:14,022 --> 00:49:16,020
Lord and Lady Richmond.

773
00:49:20,029 --> 00:49:22,993
And all points in his
majesty's kingdom,

774
00:49:23,017 --> 00:49:26,017
north, south, east, and west.

775
00:49:31,016 --> 00:49:33,000
And Mr. Smithers.

776
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:39,009
Bring in the prisoners.

777
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,720
So yous the niggers
what takes upon yourself

778
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,982
to start a roughhouse and beat
up an officer of the crown?

779
00:50:02,006 --> 00:50:04,986
Well, I see I been too
easy on you niggers.

780
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:08,980
Now I'm going to show you
who's boss around here.

781
00:50:09,004 --> 00:50:10,988
Lieutenant.

782
00:50:11,012 --> 00:50:13,000
Take them niggers
in the courtyard

783
00:50:13,024 --> 00:50:19,000
and give 'em 50 lashes
a piece and lock 'em up.

784
00:50:19,024 --> 00:50:23,982
I said lock 'em up!

785
00:50:24,006 --> 00:50:25,006
Forward march.

786
00:50:32,017 --> 00:50:34,002
Captain!

787
00:50:34,026 --> 00:50:36,997
Take your company to
the five-mile village

788
00:50:37,021 --> 00:50:40,029
and burn it off the
face of the Earth.

789
00:50:41,001 --> 00:50:42,001
Everything!

790
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,988
Understand?

791
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:52,002
Right face.

792
00:50:52,026 --> 00:50:53,026
Forward march!

793
00:50:57,013 --> 00:50:58,013
March!

794
00:51:27,008 --> 00:51:29,987
Who dare whistle
that way in my palace?

795
00:51:30,011 --> 00:51:31,982
Who dare wake up the emperor?

796
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:35,990
I'll get the hides frayed off
some of you niggers, sure.

797
00:51:36,014 --> 00:51:37,982
It was me whistled to you.

798
00:51:38,006 --> 00:51:38,994
I got news for you.

799
00:51:39,018 --> 00:51:42,982
Oh, it's you, Mr. Smithers.

800
00:51:43,006 --> 00:51:44,989
What news you got to tell me?

801
00:51:45,013 --> 00:51:45,998
Where's all your court?

802
00:51:46,022 --> 00:51:48,003
The generals and the
cabinet ministers and all?

803
00:51:48,027 --> 00:51:52,003
Oh, they mostly run the minute
I closes my eyes... drinking

804
00:51:52,027 --> 00:51:55,978
rum, talking big down the town.

805
00:51:56,002 --> 00:51:56,985
How come you don't know that?

806
00:51:57,009 --> 00:51:58,989
Ain't you sousing with
'em most every day?

807
00:51:59,013 --> 00:52:00,990
Well, I got you in
my business and I...

808
00:52:01,014 --> 00:52:01,999
Your business.

809
00:52:02,023 --> 00:52:04,003
Blimey, when you
landed here, you didn't

810
00:52:04,027 --> 00:52:05,998
have no high and mighty airs.

811
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:08,005
Talk polite, white man.

812
00:52:08,029 --> 00:52:12,003
Talk polite, do you hear me?

813
00:52:12,027 --> 00:52:14,000
I'm boss here now.

814
00:52:14,024 --> 00:52:14,995
Is you forgotten?

815
00:52:15,019 --> 00:52:15,999
It's all right.

816
00:52:16,023 --> 00:52:17,987
No harm meant, old sop.

817
00:52:18,011 --> 00:52:21,995
Well, I accept your apology.

818
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:25,997
What I was then is one thing,
and what I is now is another.

819
00:52:26,021 --> 00:52:27,991
I wasn't afraid to hire
you that time after you

820
00:52:28,015 --> 00:52:29,979
broke jail in the States.

821
00:52:30,003 --> 00:52:31,999
No, you didn't have no excuse
to look down on me for that.

822
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:34,996
You been in jail
yourself more 'n worse.

823
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:37,004
That's a lie!

824
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,995
Who told you that fairy story?

825
00:52:42,019 --> 00:52:45,004
There's some things
I ain't got to be told.

826
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:47,989
I can see 'em in folks' eyes.

827
00:52:48,013 --> 00:52:51,981
Well, from what I've been
told, it ain't safe for a black

828
00:52:52,005 --> 00:52:55,005
to kill a white
man in the States.

829
00:52:55,029 --> 00:52:58,978
You mean lynchings scare me?

830
00:52:59,002 --> 00:53:00,983
Well, I'll tell you, Smithers.

831
00:53:01,007 --> 00:53:03,987
Maybe I does kill one
white man back there.

832
00:53:04,011 --> 00:53:05,992
Maybe I does.

833
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,987
And maybe I kills
another right here before

834
00:53:09,011 --> 00:53:09,998
long if he don't look out.

835
00:53:10,022 --> 00:53:11,983
Here, you think
I'd peach on you?

836
00:53:12,007 --> 00:53:12,981
Not me.

837
00:53:13,005 --> 00:53:13,982
I'm your friend, ain't I?

838
00:53:14,006 --> 00:53:15,988
Sure you is.

839
00:53:16,012 --> 00:53:18,004
And you'd better be.

840
00:53:23,012 --> 00:53:25,001
And to show you
that I'm your friend,

841
00:53:25,025 --> 00:53:28,986
I'll tell you that bit
of news I was going to.

842
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:29,984
Go ahead.

843
00:53:30,008 --> 00:53:30,997
Shoot the breeze.

844
00:53:31,021 --> 00:53:33,993
Must be mighty bad news
from the happy way you look.

845
00:53:34,017 --> 00:53:35,988
Ain't noticed
any of the servants

846
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:39,005
or the guards around the
place this morning, I ain't.

847
00:53:46,012 --> 00:53:46,993
Oh, they all out in the garden,

848
00:53:47,017 --> 00:53:48,981
sleeping under the trees.

849
00:53:49,005 --> 00:53:51,002
All I gotta do is to ring that
gong and they come flying.

850
00:53:51,026 --> 00:53:52,979
All right.

851
00:53:53,003 --> 00:53:57,005
Ring it now, and
you'll see what I mean.

852
00:53:57,029 --> 00:53:59,012
Sure, I'll ring.

853
00:54:34,028 --> 00:54:37,984
The rotten ship is sinking,
and the bloomin' rats

854
00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:38,994
have slung their hooks.

855
00:54:39,018 --> 00:54:41,009
Low-flung woods niggers.

856
00:54:47,007 --> 00:54:50,983
Well, I reckon overplayed
my hand this once.

857
00:54:51,007 --> 00:54:55,005
A man can't take the pot on
a bobtail flush all the time.

858
00:54:55,029 --> 00:54:58,988
Was I saying I'd sit
in six months more?

859
00:54:59,012 --> 00:55:00,995
Well, I's changed my mind, then.

860
00:55:01,019 --> 00:55:05,979
I cashes in and resign the job
of emperor right this minute.

861
00:55:06,003 --> 00:55:07,996
Well, blimey you're a
cool bird and no mistake.

862
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:08,999
No use fussing.

863
00:55:09,023 --> 00:55:10,999
When I know the
game's up, I kisses it

864
00:55:11,023 --> 00:55:14,984
goodbye without no long wait.

865
00:55:15,008 --> 00:55:16,980
They's all run off to
the hills, ain't they?

866
00:55:17,004 --> 00:55:17,985
Yes.

867
00:55:18,009 --> 00:55:18,992
Lem was taking 'em,
every man jack of 'em.

868
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:20,999
Then the revolution
is at the post.

869
00:55:21,023 --> 00:55:23,980
And the emperor better get his
feet smoking up that trail.

870
00:55:24,004 --> 00:55:25,564
Going to look for
your horse, ain't you?

871
00:55:26,001 --> 00:55:26,982
Well, you won't find it.

872
00:55:27,006 --> 00:55:28,366
They steals the
horses first thing.

873
00:55:31,016 --> 00:55:35,979
Well, then I hoofs it.

874
00:55:36,003 --> 00:55:38,006
Feet, do your duty.

875
00:55:41,027 --> 00:55:42,985
3:30.

876
00:55:43,009 --> 00:55:45,995
Sundown's at 6:30 or thereabout.

877
00:55:46,019 --> 00:55:47,996
Ho, I got plenty of
time, make it easy.

878
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:50,978
Yeah, well don't you
be so blasted sure.

879
00:55:51,002 --> 00:55:53,242
You'll have to hustle to get
to to that port in 12 hours,

880
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,005
even if you knew the trails
like bloomin' native.

881
00:55:55,029 --> 00:55:59,992
Looka here, white man, did you
think I's a natural born fool?

882
00:56:00,016 --> 00:56:01,980
Why, I's gone out in that
forest so many times,

883
00:56:02,004 --> 00:56:04,986
pretending to hunt, I know's
it high and low like a book.

884
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:07,001
I could find them trails
with my eyes shut.

885
00:56:07,025 --> 00:56:10,981
And I got tin grub hid there
under a big white stone

886
00:56:11,005 --> 00:56:11,998
where I can find it.

887
00:56:12,022 --> 00:56:14,993
Oh, I'll be at the edge of the
forest by the time dark comes.

888
00:56:15,017 --> 00:56:17,994
Once in them woods, them
niggers will never find me.

889
00:56:18,018 --> 00:56:20,988
Dawn tomorrow I reaches
the coast and boards

890
00:56:21,012 --> 00:56:22,988
that French gun boat.

891
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:25,992
I got to laugh at these fool
black trash around here.

892
00:56:26,016 --> 00:56:27,002
It's so easy.

893
00:56:27,026 --> 00:56:30,993
Supposing something happens
and they does nab you?

894
00:56:31,017 --> 00:56:33,987
I's got five lead bullets
in this gun, good enough

895
00:56:34,011 --> 00:56:35,028
for common bush niggers.

896
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,986
And after that, I's got
this silver bullet left

897
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:39,998
to cheat 'em outta getting me.

898
00:56:40,022 --> 00:56:43,990
I tells 'em when the time
comes, I kills myself with it.

899
00:56:44,014 --> 00:56:45,983
That's because I'm the
only man in the world

900
00:56:46,007 --> 00:56:47,002
big enough to get me.

901
00:56:47,026 --> 00:56:48,998
Then you had silver bullet made?

902
00:56:49,022 --> 00:56:49,989
Honest?

903
00:56:50,013 --> 00:56:51,029
Oh, I sure did.

904
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:53,980
Here she be.

905
00:56:54,004 --> 00:56:58,978
Five lead bullets and
a silver baby at last.

906
00:56:59,002 --> 00:57:00,987
Don't she shine pretty?

907
00:57:01,011 --> 00:57:01,994
Let me see.

908
00:57:02,018 --> 00:57:03,004
Keep your hands where
they belong, white man.

909
00:57:03,028 --> 00:57:04,987
Blimey, you'd think
I was a blasted thief.

910
00:57:05,011 --> 00:57:05,993
No, it ain't that.

911
00:57:06,017 --> 00:57:08,978
I know you're scared
to steal from me.

912
00:57:09,002 --> 00:57:11,982
I ain't allowing nobody
to touch this baby.

913
00:57:12,006 --> 00:57:13,992
She's my rabbit's foot.

914
00:57:14,016 --> 00:57:15,992
A sort of charm, eh?

915
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:19,984
Blimey, you'll need all your
bloomin' charms before long,

916
00:57:20,008 --> 00:57:21,978
so help me.

917
00:57:38,017 --> 00:57:39,988
What's that drumbeating for?

918
00:57:40,012 --> 00:57:41,003
For you!

919
00:57:41,027 --> 00:57:43,991
The blacks is having a
war dance in the hills,

920
00:57:44,015 --> 00:57:46,988
working up their courage
for they start after you.

921
00:57:47,012 --> 00:57:47,984
Let them.

922
00:57:48,008 --> 00:57:49,981
They'll sure need it.

923
00:57:50,005 --> 00:57:52,029
They're making all sorts
of devil spells and charms

924
00:57:53,001 --> 00:57:53,999
against your silver bullet.

925
00:57:54,023 --> 00:57:57,006
Takes more than that
to scare this chicken.

926
00:58:08,013 --> 00:58:10,987
Tonight, when it's
pitch black in the forest,

927
00:58:11,011 --> 00:58:12,004
they'll be sending
their pet devils

928
00:58:12,028 --> 00:58:14,984
and ghosts hounding after you.

929
00:58:15,008 --> 00:58:16,984
You'll find your bloomin'
hair will be standing

930
00:58:17,008 --> 00:58:18,015
on end tomorrow morning.

931
00:58:21,009 --> 00:58:25,986
It's a mighty queer place, that
forest is, even in daylight.

932
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:28,000
You don't know what
might happen there.

933
00:58:28,024 --> 00:58:31,997
It's that rotten still.

934
00:58:32,021 --> 00:58:35,001
Always sends the cold shivers
down my back the minute

935
00:58:35,025 --> 00:58:36,995
I gets in it.

936
00:58:37,019 --> 00:58:39,005
Go along, white man.

937
00:58:39,029 --> 00:58:41,990
You ain't talking to this baby.

938
00:58:42,014 --> 00:58:44,982
What ghosts and
got to do with me?

939
00:58:45,006 --> 00:58:46,991
Well, don't you know I was
a member in good standing

940
00:58:47,015 --> 00:58:48,983
of the Baptist church?

941
00:58:49,007 --> 00:58:50,000
Let 'em try their
heathen tricks.

942
00:58:50,024 --> 00:58:53,029
And the Baptist church
done protect me.

943
00:58:54,001 --> 00:58:54,990
Land 'em all in hell.

944
00:58:55,014 --> 00:58:56,981
Yeah, you ain't paid
much heed to your Baptist

945
00:58:57,005 --> 00:59:00,029
church down here, taking up with
them bloomin' witch doctors.

946
00:59:01,001 --> 00:59:02,984
Oh, sure, I pretend.

947
00:59:03,008 --> 00:59:05,002
It don't get me nothing
to do missionary work

948
00:59:05,026 --> 00:59:07,004
for the Baptist church.

949
00:59:07,028 --> 00:59:08,989
I's after the coin.

950
00:59:09,013 --> 00:59:13,029
And I lays my religion on
the shelf for the time being.

951
00:59:14,001 --> 00:59:14,981
But I ain't got
the time to waste

952
00:59:15,005 --> 00:59:15,999
no more fool talk with you.

953
00:59:16,023 --> 00:59:18,001
I'm going away this second.

954
00:59:21,025 --> 00:59:22,003
So long, white man.

955
00:59:22,027 --> 00:59:24,001
I'll see you in jail
sometime, maybe.

956
00:59:24,025 --> 00:59:25,983
Not me, you won't.

957
00:59:26,007 --> 00:59:27,978
Here, you ain't going
out this way, are you?

958
00:59:28,002 --> 00:59:30,003
You think I'd sneak out the
back door like a common nigger?

959
00:59:30,027 --> 00:59:31,984
I's emperor yet, ain't I?

960
00:59:32,008 --> 00:59:33,984
And the Emperor Jones
leaves the way he come.

961
00:59:34,008 --> 00:59:36,000
And that black trash
don't dare stop him.

962
00:59:36,024 --> 00:59:37,029
Not yet, leastways.

963
00:59:46,004 --> 00:59:49,998
Listen to that roll
call, will you?

964
00:59:50,022 --> 00:59:53,019
Must be a mighty big
drum carry that far.

965
00:59:56,006 --> 00:59:59,980
Well, if they ain't no whole
brass band to see me off,

966
01:00:00,004 --> 01:00:02,995
I sure got the drum part of it.

967
01:00:03,019 --> 01:00:05,012
So long, white man.

968
01:00:13,024 --> 01:00:16,020
Give my regards to
any ghosts you meet.

969
01:00:33,018 --> 01:00:34,005
Here I is.

970
01:00:34,029 --> 01:00:37,985
In the nick of time, too.

971
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:43,028
Sure, I's
tuckered out, sure enough.

972
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:44,984
Whew.

973
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:47,000
That soft emperor job
sure ain't no training

974
01:00:47,024 --> 01:00:49,986
for a long hike over that
plain in the broiling sun.

975
01:00:55,005 --> 01:00:56,992
Bush niggers.

976
01:00:57,016 --> 01:01:01,000
A wonder they wouldn't get
sick of beating that drum.

977
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:04,989
Sound louder, seem like.

978
01:01:05,013 --> 01:01:07,979
When did they start in after me?

979
01:01:08,003 --> 01:01:11,005
Oh, sure, they miles
and miles behind.

980
01:01:11,029 --> 01:01:14,001
What you getting fidgety about?

981
01:01:14,025 --> 01:01:15,980
You know what?

982
01:01:16,004 --> 01:01:16,982
Your belly's empty.

983
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:17,997
That's what's the
matter with you.

984
01:01:18,021 --> 01:01:19,997
Nothing but wind
on your stomach.

985
01:01:20,021 --> 01:01:21,993
Course you feels diggety.

986
01:01:22,017 --> 01:01:26,981
Well, we eats
right here and now.

987
01:01:27,005 --> 01:01:28,981
White stone, white stone.

988
01:01:29,005 --> 01:01:30,992
Where is you?

989
01:01:31,016 --> 01:01:32,995
Ah, here you is.

990
01:01:33,019 --> 01:01:34,996
I know this was the right place.

991
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:39,978
Box of grub, come to me.

992
01:01:40,002 --> 01:01:42,986
Ain't here.

993
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:45,982
Has I lost the place?

994
01:01:46,006 --> 01:01:47,998
There's another stone.

995
01:01:48,022 --> 01:01:49,022
Yes, that's it.

996
01:01:53,005 --> 01:01:54,986
Ain't here, neither.

997
01:01:55,010 --> 01:01:56,001
Grub, where is you?

998
01:01:56,025 --> 01:01:57,988
You ain't here.

999
01:01:58,012 --> 01:02:01,013
Has I got to go hungry
in them woods all night?

1000
01:02:05,007 --> 01:02:09,003
Can't tell nothing
from them trees.

1001
01:02:09,027 --> 01:02:13,029
Nothing around here look
like I ever seen it before.

1002
01:02:14,001 --> 01:02:16,997
I done lost the
place sure enough.

1003
01:02:17,021 --> 01:02:19,978
Mighty queer.

1004
01:02:20,002 --> 01:02:21,002
Mighty queer.

1005
01:02:24,002 --> 01:02:27,001
Woods, is you trying to
put something over on me?

1006
01:02:30,002 --> 01:02:30,983
Who that? Who that?

1007
01:02:31,007 --> 01:02:31,988
What is you?

1008
01:02:32,012 --> 01:02:40,012
Get away from me before
I... They're gone.

1009
01:02:41,018 --> 01:02:44,987
Yeah, that shot fix 'em.

1010
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,989
Oh, it was only a little animal.

1011
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:48,990
Little wild pigs, I reckon.

1012
01:02:49,014 --> 01:02:53,979
They maybe rooted out
your grub and eat it.

1013
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:54,993
Sure, you fool nigger.

1014
01:02:55,017 --> 01:02:58,001
What you think they is, hants?

1015
01:03:04,012 --> 01:03:06,994
You give the game away
when you fired that shot.

1016
01:03:07,018 --> 01:03:09,025
Them niggers'll hear
that for certain.

1017
01:03:17,004 --> 01:03:17,983
Get in, nigger.

1018
01:03:18,007 --> 01:03:18,988
What you scared at?

1019
01:03:19,012 --> 01:03:20,990
Ain't nothing there
but the trees.

1020
01:03:21,014 --> 01:03:22,028
Get in there.

1021
01:03:35,001 --> 01:03:35,990
The moon's rising.

1022
01:03:36,014 --> 01:03:38,981
Did you hear that, nigger?

1023
01:03:39,005 --> 01:03:42,999
Get more light from this out,
and you sees where you's going.

1024
01:03:43,023 --> 01:03:43,996
Cheer up.

1025
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:47,010
From now on you has a snap.

1026
01:03:51,009 --> 01:03:51,999
Whew.

1027
01:03:52,023 --> 01:03:54,992
It's warm.

1028
01:03:55,016 --> 01:03:58,002
And that's a fact.

1029
01:03:58,026 --> 01:04:03,980
How long I been making
tracks in these here woods?

1030
01:04:04,004 --> 01:04:05,019
Feel like forever.

1031
01:04:08,026 --> 01:04:13,011
This am a long night
for you, your majesty.

1032
01:04:16,006 --> 01:04:17,003
Majesty.

1033
01:04:17,027 --> 01:04:20,997
There ain't much majesty
about this baby now.

1034
01:04:21,021 --> 01:04:21,995
Never mind.

1035
01:04:22,019 --> 01:04:23,988
It's all a part of the game.

1036
01:04:24,012 --> 01:04:26,002
This night come to an
end like everything else.

1037
01:04:26,026 --> 01:04:30,003
You gets there safe and has
that bank roll in your hands,

1038
01:04:30,027 --> 01:04:32,005
then you laughs at all this.

1039
01:05:13,026 --> 01:05:15,992
What you singing
for, you poor nigger?

1040
01:05:16,016 --> 01:05:20,980
Want all the world to hear you?

1041
01:05:21,004 --> 01:05:23,992
Hear that old drum.

1042
01:05:24,016 --> 01:05:27,003
Sure gets nearer from the sound.

1043
01:05:27,027 --> 01:05:31,987
They're packing
it along with 'em.

1044
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:34,012
Time for me to move.

1045
01:05:38,025 --> 01:05:42,028
What's the little queer,
clickety sound I hear?

1046
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:46,978
Sound like... sound... it
sounds like some nigger

1047
01:05:47,002 --> 01:05:48,005
were shootin' crap.

1048
01:05:48,029 --> 01:05:52,003
Time I beats it quick
when I get them notes.

1049
01:05:52,027 --> 01:05:53,003
Who there?

1050
01:05:53,027 --> 01:05:55,001
Who that?

1051
01:05:55,025 --> 01:05:57,013
Is that you, Jeff?

1052
01:06:00,007 --> 01:06:04,993
Jeff, I'm sure mighty
glad to see you.

1053
01:06:05,017 --> 01:06:09,983
But they told me you done died
from that cut I gives you.

1054
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:14,979
How you come to be here, nigger?

1055
01:06:15,003 --> 01:06:17,986
Ain't you going to look up?

1056
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:21,028
Can't you speak to me?

1057
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,981
Is you... is you a hant?

1058
01:06:25,005 --> 01:06:25,005
Nigger.

1059
01:06:25,029 --> 01:06:27,982
I killed you dead once.

1060
01:06:28,006 --> 01:06:29,001
Has I got to kill you again?

1061
01:06:29,025 --> 01:06:31,001
You take it then.

1062
01:06:38,001 --> 01:06:42,994
He's gone, anyway,
hant or no hant.

1063
01:06:43,018 --> 01:06:45,005
That shot fixed him.

1064
01:06:47,027 --> 01:06:49,998
It's getting nearer.

1065
01:06:50,022 --> 01:06:52,996
He's coming fast, and here
I is, shooting shots to let

1066
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:54,978
him know just where I is.

1067
01:06:55,002 --> 01:06:55,002
Glory.

1068
01:06:55,026 --> 01:06:56,026
I's got to run.

1069
01:07:11,011 --> 01:07:12,985
I'm melting with
heat from running

1070
01:07:13,009 --> 01:07:14,003
and running and running.

1071
01:07:14,027 --> 01:07:19,992
Damn, this here coat
like a straightjacket.

1072
01:07:20,016 --> 01:07:20,984
That's better.

1073
01:07:21,008 --> 01:07:22,982
Now I can breathe.

1074
01:07:23,006 --> 01:07:25,029
I gets rid of them frippity
emperor's trappings

1075
01:07:26,001 --> 01:07:28,996
and I travels lighter.

1076
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:31,029
How'd this road ever get here?

1077
01:07:32,001 --> 01:07:35,983
I never remember
seein' it before.

1078
01:07:36,007 --> 01:07:39,982
These woods are sure full of
the queerest things at night.

1079
01:07:40,006 --> 01:07:43,979
Lord God, don't let me
see no more of them hants.

1080
01:07:44,003 --> 01:07:44,988
Oh, sure.

1081
01:07:45,012 --> 01:07:46,997
That was all in your head.

1082
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:48,028
Wasn't nothing there.

1083
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:49,983
Wasn't no Jeff.

1084
01:07:50,007 --> 01:07:51,979
You know what?

1085
01:07:52,003 --> 01:07:53,982
You just get seeing them things
because your belly's empty,

1086
01:07:54,006 --> 01:07:57,002
and you're sick
with hunger inside.

1087
01:07:57,026 --> 01:08:01,992
Bless God I don't see no
more whatever they is.

1088
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:09,013
Mercy, Lord, mercy.

1089
01:08:18,019 --> 01:08:18,997
Yes, sir.

1090
01:08:19,021 --> 01:08:20,982

01:08:21,006 --> 01:08:22,006

1092
01:08:29,018 --> 01:08:29,999

1094
01:09:03,006 --> 01:09:04,001
Where's my hammer?

1095
01:09:04,025 --> 01:09:07,986
Give me my hammer and
I splits his head.

1096
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:09,981
Give me a hammer, will ya?

1097
01:09:10,005 --> 01:09:12,029

white devil, if it's

1099
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:16,991
the last thing I ever does.

1100
01:09:17,015 --> 01:09:19,024
Ghost and devil,
I kills you again!

1101
01:09:27,004 --> 01:09:30,986
Oh, Lord, what I
going to do now?

1102
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:33,000
Ain't got no bullets left.

1103
01:09:33,024 --> 01:09:35,986
Only the silver one.

1104
01:10:03,014 --> 01:10:04,983
What is this place?

1105
01:10:05,007 --> 01:10:08,011
Seem like I... seem like
I been here before.

1106
01:10:39,027 --> 01:10:42,983

1107
01:10:43,007 --> 01:10:46,000
Seem like... seem like

1108
01:10:46,024 --> 01:10:50,983

1109
01:10:51,007 --> 01:10:56,989
I remember... seem like
I been here before.

1110
01:10:57,013 --> 01:11:00,995
Oh, oh, glory, I'm

Oh Lord.

1115
01:11:08,023 --> 01:11:10,985
Down here where these
fool bush niggers

1116
01:11:11,009 --> 01:11:12,994
raised me up into the
seat of the mighty,

1117
01:11:13,018 --> 01:11:15,988
I steals all I could grab.

1118
01:11:16,012 --> 01:11:17,028

1119
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,001

Oh, Lord, no.

1128
01:12:18,016 --> 01:12:19,016

1129
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:00,003

1131
01:13:06,002 --> 01:13:08,982
My Lord, hear my prayers!

1132
01:13:09,006 --> 01:13:09,994
Oh!

1133
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:11,978

You don't gets me yet!

1135
01:13:22,018 --> 01:13:25,997
I bet he's miles away way by
now and safe at the coast.

1136
01:13:26,021 --> 01:13:28,993
I told you you'd
lose him, didn't I?

1137
01:13:29,017 --> 01:13:32,989
Beating your silly drum and
casting your stinking spells.

1138
01:13:33,013 --> 01:13:35,000
Blimey, what a pack.

1139
01:13:35,024 --> 01:13:35,999
We'll catch him.

1140
01:13:36,023 --> 01:13:37,978
You see.

1141
01:13:38,002 --> 01:13:39,980
Why don't you go in the
woods and hunt after him?

1142
01:13:40,004 --> 01:13:40,989
What's the good in waiting?

1143
01:13:41,013 --> 01:13:44,000
We catch him.

1144
01:14:05,012 --> 01:14:07,978
Well, you ain't thinking
that's him, I hopes.

1145
01:14:08,002 --> 01:14:08,984
That's him.

1146
01:14:09,008 --> 01:14:10,979
My men got silver
bullet, kill him sure.

1147
01:14:11,003 --> 01:14:12,005

1148
01:14:12,029 --> 01:14:13,989
Lead bullet no kill him.

1149
01:14:14,013 --> 01:14:15,005

I cook money, make

1151
01:14:18,008 --> 01:14:20,004
Make strong charm, too.

1152
01:14:20,028 --> 01:14:21,028
Ahh.

Well, they did for you
right enough, Jonesy, me lad.

01:15:15,021 --> 01:15:18,988
Dead as a herring.

1155
01:15:19,012 --> 01:15:20,993
Where's all your
high and mighty airs

1156
01:15:21,017 --> 01:15:23,011

1157

01:15:28,026 --> 01:15:29,026
Blimey.

1159
01:15:32,010 --> 01:15:37,026

the height of style.
