1
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,262
Hey Warden, when's he going?

2
00:01:28,315 --> 00:01:29,636
Taking him down now.

3
00:01:29,637 --> 00:01:31,618
Guess that pink slip
ain't coming warden?

4
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,819
Looks bad.

5
00:01:32,841 --> 00:01:34,181
How do you think he'll take it?

6
00:01:34,203 --> 00:01:36,189
Like a soldier my boy.

7
00:01:36,286 --> 00:01:39,989
No ketchup? This is the
worst last meal I ever had.

8
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:41,997
Sorry Jackson, here's the Warden.

9
00:01:43,696 --> 00:01:45,938
Sure glad to see you Warden.
So the Governor came through

10
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,061
with that stay, I knew he
would he's a very good guy.

11
00:01:48,062 --> 00:01:50,971
Sorry Jackson, no word from the Governor.

12
00:01:51,146 --> 00:01:52,436
Sorry.

13
00:01:55,111 --> 00:01:56,653
No word?

14
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,860
No word, huh?

15
00:02:02,882 --> 00:02:06,076
Well, I'll know who to
vote for next time.

16
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:07,668
Come on Jackson.

17
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:20,452
Nice cosy little nook.

18
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,594
So that's it. Mind if I take a look?

19
00:02:27,595 --> 00:02:29,036
I wouldn't advise it.

20
00:02:29,037 --> 00:02:31,468
You're getting soft Warden.

21
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:39,040
Gas. Haven't even put in electricity.

22
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:41,163
Right in here, Jackson.

23
00:02:48,463 --> 00:02:52,027
I'm going to grant you a special
privilege not often given to a man

24
00:02:52,028 --> 00:02:53,648
in your position.

25
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:58,265
It's what you asked for. The chance
to tell your story to the newspapers.

26
00:02:58,717 --> 00:03:01,672
To get it off your chest.
Thanks, Warden.

27
00:03:02,762 --> 00:03:04,908
See you in a while Jackson.

28
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,993
I'll be right here.

29
00:03:07,609 --> 00:03:12,797
Mr Jackson I think you're wonderful.
You've really got what it takes.

30
00:03:12,936 --> 00:03:15,298
I ain't exactly a cream puff.
Cigarette?

31
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:17,621
Nevermind.
Thanks George.

32
00:03:17,622 --> 00:03:19,723
There might be a saw in that one.

33
00:03:19,745 --> 00:03:22,268
Well you've got what I call guts.

34
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:24,973
The way I figured...
Anybody got a match?

35
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:30,439
The way I figured if a guy feels in
his heart he's taking a phoney rap

36
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,474
it's not so tough to kick the bucket.

37
00:03:33,524 --> 00:03:36,114
It's not so tough to
walk that last mile.

38
00:03:36,328 --> 00:03:39,316
It's just... tough to light
a cigarette, that's all.

39
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:44,177
Say Jackson, how did
you get into this mess?

40
00:03:44,178 --> 00:03:45,845
Was it a... woman?

41
00:03:46,021 --> 00:03:49,745
It's always a woman.
You should have seen this woman.

42
00:03:49,746 --> 00:03:53,029
Skin like smooth satin.
Beautiful blue eyes.

43
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:58,628
Dark silken hair. Kind of a gal that make
you want to give away your last shirt.

44
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,601
I borrowed this from the Warden.
This girl...

45
00:04:01,602 --> 00:04:03,003
How did you meet her?
Did she come up to your office?

46
00:04:03,004 --> 00:04:04,084
Did you fall in love with her?

47
00:04:04,085 --> 00:04:05,686
Wait a minute, one at a time.

48
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:08,756
You may not know this but
I wasn't always a detective.

49
00:04:09,172 --> 00:04:11,734
Before they pinned this murder
rap on me I had one of the sweetest

50
00:04:11,735 --> 00:04:13,257
little rackets in San Francisco.

51
00:04:13,258 --> 00:04:16,451
A legitimate business?
Better than legitimate, it was profitable.

52
00:04:16,462 --> 00:04:20,186
My office was in the Trafalgar Building,
just on the edge of Chinatown.

53
00:04:20,187 --> 00:04:22,889
In Chinatown.
No, not right in.

54
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,501
Do you know California Street,
from the hill at Stockton?

55
00:04:26,115 --> 00:04:30,141
Coming down the hill on a cable car
you could just see my office.

56
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:36,278
Third floor front. Ronnie was the name,
"Ronnie, Baby Photographer".

57
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:40,694
I'll never forget that day. For two hours
I'd been trying to make that little brat smile.

58
00:04:40,695 --> 00:04:43,922
I threw the book at him
every sure-fire trick of the trade

59
00:05:03,045 --> 00:05:05,589
This kid's going to grow
up to be a sponser.

60
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:08,715
He's even wearing out the lights.

61
00:05:11,416 --> 00:05:13,208
Quick, snap it!

62
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:15,850
Watch the birdie!

63
00:05:16,222 --> 00:05:18,905
There you are, another masterpiece.

64
00:05:18,906 --> 00:05:21,371
Sweetems you're wonderful.

65
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,712
You're wonderful too, Mr Jackson.

66
00:05:23,713 --> 00:05:26,337
That's because I was a kid once myself.

67
00:05:32,204 --> 00:05:35,796
I'm just dying to see those proofs.
When will they be ready?

68
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:39,636
The first thing in the morning Mrs Fong.
I'm sure you'll like them.

69
00:05:39,774 --> 00:05:42,843
Goodbye you little rascal.

70
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:47,143
Pull him off!
Give Mr Jackson back his fingers!

71
00:05:47,144 --> 00:05:49,529
Time! Time!

72
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:53,063
Doesn't he get meat at home?

73
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,617
You happy little gourmet.

74
00:05:56,276 --> 00:05:59,311
He's sweet though.
Let me see.

75
00:06:00,722 --> 00:06:05,948
"Baby photographer. A fine job for a two
fisted he-man like Ronnie Jackson.

76
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:10,474
I had promised to have pictures of the kid
ready by morning so I got to work on development.

77
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:13,859
Must have been about 20 minutes later,
half an hour or something like that

78
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,322
when I heard a door slam
in the hallway outside.

79
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:19,467
I knew it was Sam McCloud coming
back to his office from a busy day

80
00:06:19,468 --> 00:06:22,250
pinning the goods on a few
assorted croocks and murderers.

81
00:06:22,272 --> 00:06:26,148
Sam McCloud, the coolest, toughest
private eye in the business.

82
00:06:26,157 --> 00:06:30,955
I wanted to be a detective too.
It only took brains, courage and a gun.

83
00:06:30,963 --> 00:06:33,064
And I had the gun.

84
00:06:33,086 --> 00:06:37,350
I'd figured out a way for Sam to hire me,
so I started across the hall.

85
00:06:37,372 --> 00:06:41,857
Already I could see my name in big letters
"Ronnie Jackson, Private Eye".

86
00:06:41,858 --> 00:06:46,567
What I didn't see was the small print
underneath: "Rest in Peace".

87
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:51,702
Don't worry your pretty
little head about it, baby.

88
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:54,575
Hi Sam.

89
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:59,431
Listen baby, it will take more
than a couple of... to scare me off.

90
00:07:02,045 --> 00:07:05,828
We'll have to talk that over some rainy
night in front of a nice warm fire

91
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,076
I'll bring the matches.

92
00:07:09,615 --> 00:07:11,356
What's on your mind, Ronnie?

93
00:07:11,378 --> 00:07:16,384
Matches... No, I mean, look Sam, it
came today, license and everything

94
00:07:16,385 --> 00:07:18,026
now can I be your partner?

95
00:07:18,027 --> 00:07:21,631
I told you before, stick to watching
the birdie and you'll die of old age.

96
00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:23,553
But I was cut out for this kind of life.

97
00:07:23,554 --> 00:07:26,677
All my life I wanted to be a hard-boiled
detective like Humphrey Bogart,

98
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:29,792
Dick Powell, even Alan Ladd.

99
00:07:30,123 --> 00:07:34,888
Have those beautiful women coming into the
office, those warm fires on those rainy nights

100
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:37,799
that's the kind of life I want.
How about it Sam?

101
00:07:44,603 --> 00:07:46,316
Smooth, huh?

102
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:51,511
Say, I can be a lot of help to you Sam.
Look, here's my latest invention, right here.

103
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:54,034
A camera with a keyhole lens.

104
00:07:54,035 --> 00:07:58,824
Takes pictures through doors.
I've been kicked out of five hotels already.

105
00:07:59,923 --> 00:08:02,526
How about it Sam?
Can I go to work for you?

106
00:08:02,527 --> 00:08:05,231
Just give me a simple yes or no.

107
00:08:05,371 --> 00:08:06,412
No.

108
00:08:06,813 --> 00:08:11,248
Oh, but that's too simple.
Why don't you give it a little thought?

109
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:14,822
I'm going to Chicago for a few days.
I'll leave the door open

110
00:08:14,823 --> 00:08:17,333
so you can come through
and answer the phone.

111
00:08:25,157 --> 00:08:26,540
Little stiff.

112
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:33,688
I could go with you, I've got
a coat just like that.

113
00:08:33,689 --> 00:08:37,840
I could help you out a bit in case
you're running any keyhole work...

114
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:41,886
You're sure there's nothing I can do for you?
Yeah, you keep your nose clean.

115
00:08:44,744 --> 00:08:47,426
That's the last chance I'll give him.

116
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:50,991
Keep my nose clean.
Answer the phone.

117
00:08:50,992 --> 00:08:56,066
I oughta go in business for myself.
"Ronnie Jackson, Private Eye".

118
00:08:58,362 --> 00:09:03,630
I could catch those gummed-up hopsles
over a warm fire even if it wasn't raining

119
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,675
Drink as much as he can.

120
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:53,056
I suppose you wonder why I act this way.
No, every girl that comes in here does that.

121
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:57,441
I need a detective.
Please say that you'll help me.

122
00:09:57,442 --> 00:10:01,877
Yeah, but look, I'm just...
Please Mr McCloud, please.

123
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,971
Just call me Sam.

124
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:08,963
This is my type of case.
Spll it sister.

125
00:10:09,338 --> 00:10:13,807
My name is Carlotta Montay,
Baroness Montay.

126
00:10:14,224 --> 00:10:15,812
Baroness?

127
00:10:17,108 --> 00:10:20,781
I feel as though someone's watching me.
Yeah, that's me.

128
00:10:23,677 --> 00:10:28,984
I arrived here three days ago on the
Queen of Peru, with the Baron, my husband.

129
00:10:29,485 --> 00:10:31,198
Oh, you've got a husband.

130
00:10:34,211 --> 00:10:36,854
This was taken the day we arrived.

131
00:10:36,855 --> 00:10:40,659
A two-column cut in the
"San Francisco Citizen", he must rate.

132
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,862
I'm in trouble, deep trouble.

133
00:10:42,863 --> 00:10:45,946
What's the wheel chair for?
My husband is an invalid.

134
00:10:45,947 --> 00:10:49,070
He hasn't been out of that
wheel chair in seven years.

135
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:52,185
You're in trouble.
Keep talking.

136
00:10:52,476 --> 00:10:56,641
At the dock I went ahead to clear
our luggage through customs.

137
00:10:56,642 --> 00:11:01,948
I was gone 5, 10 minutes at the most.
When I returned he had disappeared.

138
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,533
A snatch job, huh?
Have you gone to the police?

139
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:10,801
No. If I go to the police they'll kill him.

140
00:11:11,221 --> 00:11:15,532
Who's they?
That's what I want you to find out.

141
00:11:15,869 --> 00:11:22,938
Look, I have no money, but this ring can be
pawned anywhere for at least $5000.

142
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,282
Oh, look sister, five grand is a
lot of moolah! You don't have to...

143
00:11:27,283 --> 00:11:30,967
The ring is nothing.
We Montay are the generous.

144
00:11:30,968 --> 00:11:35,133
If you will just find my husband
I will be so grateful.

145
00:11:35,134 --> 00:11:37,336
You will see.

146
00:11:37,337 --> 00:11:42,011
I'll bring the matches.
But this isn't necessary.

147
00:11:45,427 --> 00:11:49,863
What's the matter?
Listen, they mustn't find me here.

148
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:52,356
I don't hear anything.

149
00:11:52,357 --> 00:11:56,712
Be at this address as soon as you can.

150
00:11:56,923 --> 00:11:59,958
Would five minutes be too soon?

151
00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:12,172
We're dealing with dangerous men,
be careful.

152
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,867
They mustn't know you're a detective.
Don't worry your pretty little head

153
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:19,336
about it honey, I'll find your
husband... fool that I am.

154
00:12:19,794 --> 00:12:22,668
Somebody's coming.

155
00:12:25,321 --> 00:12:28,744
Guard this map, with your life.
With my life?

156
00:12:28,766 --> 00:12:30,752
Hurry.

157
00:12:40,982 --> 00:12:45,087
It's you Mabel, I'm sorry.

158
00:12:45,388 --> 00:12:47,021
There you are.

159
00:12:47,191 --> 00:12:49,753
Come in the studio some night after hours
and I'll take your picture.

160
00:12:49,754 --> 00:12:52,504
When everybody's gone, no charge.

161
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:58,667
Except for the negatives. Come right in.
Prints are a dollar and a half. Any time.

162
00:13:25,883 --> 00:13:30,273
Well, what are you waiting for,
you want to be a detective, don't you?

163
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,920
Let's see, what was that address?

164
00:13:36,017 --> 00:13:39,164
Oh, the map, my life.

165
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,027
Smooth.

166
00:14:01,451 --> 00:14:03,039
Small bullets.

167
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:12,465
Ain't this your camera, Ronnie?
Oh, yeah thank you very much.

168
00:14:12,466 --> 00:14:18,656
You don't have to pull no gun on me
to kiss me. Any time.

169
00:14:20,878 --> 00:14:25,002
Well, there I was on my own, a missing
husband and a dark eyed dreamboat

170
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:26,725
up to her gorgeous lips in trouble.

171
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:28,847
What a parley.

172
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:33,816
And that mysterious map, the whole thing
just like you'd read it in a detective magazine.

173
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:37,759
I head my car up to the address the doll gave
me and turns out this place is practically

174
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,031
a sleeper jump from town.

175
00:14:40,043 --> 00:14:43,086
Anyway... later that afternoon I'm driving
through the gates of one of those

176
00:14:43,387 --> 00:14:46,058
upper bracket estates
down in the peninsula.

177
00:14:46,311 --> 00:14:48,050
Pretty soon I come
to another gate.

178
00:14:48,073 --> 00:14:50,756
That should have been my cue
to put the car in reverse.

179
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:53,062
Then I get a load of the mansion.

180
00:14:53,481 --> 00:14:57,646
What a joint. Must have been something
left over from "Wuthering Heights".

181
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:01,931
You know, the kind of a house that looks like
you've been hunting quail in the hallways?

182
00:15:01,932 --> 00:15:05,320
I didn't know it then, but
I was going to be the quail.

183
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,928
Beautiful day, isn't it?

184
00:15:13,068 --> 00:15:14,780
Maybe it isn't so beautiful.

185
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:19,381
It is day, though.

186
00:15:20,678 --> 00:15:22,391
But it's late.

187
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,313
Sort of.

188
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:32,598
Allow me.

189
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,728
Dr Lundau, good afternoon sir.
Good afternoon, Kismet.

190
00:15:43,268 --> 00:15:46,257
Baroness Montay is expecting me.

191
00:15:46,673 --> 00:15:49,636
Pronto.
Oh, yes. Won't you come in?

192
00:15:49,637 --> 00:15:51,270
Pronto.

193
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,887
Nice cheerful place. What time
do they bring the mummies out?

194
00:15:57,888 --> 00:16:01,612
Very amusing sir. Madame la baronesse
is in the living room.

195
00:16:01,613 --> 00:16:04,456
Shall I announce you?
Nevermind, I'll take it from here.

196
00:16:04,457 --> 00:16:06,648
May I help you with your overcoat?

197
00:16:07,781 --> 00:16:11,772
Pardon sir, your collar.

198
00:16:12,548 --> 00:16:15,616
Here we are.
Thanks Cuddles.

199
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:18,700
Very amusing.

200
00:16:33,336 --> 00:16:37,282
Miss Montay.
Hello. Pretty song, isn't it?

201
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,734
Yeah, it's pretty, but you were so anxious...

202
00:17:25,807 --> 00:17:31,113
Quick. First I must know this.
Are you a man who's afraid of danger?

203
00:17:32,015 --> 00:17:37,021
No, you can get as close as you like.
I'm with you to my dying breath.

204
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:40,585
Please you mustn't.
Yeah, better not leave any fingerprints.

205
00:17:40,586 --> 00:17:45,592
Listen closely, my uncle Baron
Montay came to this country...

206
00:17:45,593 --> 00:17:49,619
Your uncle? But I thought you
said the guy was your husband.

207
00:17:52,162 --> 00:17:55,005
I had to have your help.
I know men.

208
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:59,090
Somehow they always seem to be more
interested in the problems of young wives

209
00:17:59,091 --> 00:18:01,534
with older husbands.

210
00:18:01,535 --> 00:18:06,020
No, it just seems that way to you.
Please listen.

211
00:18:06,021 --> 00:18:09,504
My uncle came to this country
on a very important mission.

212
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:13,088
So important that he wouldn't tell
anyone about it, not even me.

213
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:18,896
You uncle, not your husband. Well, did I
quote you any rates, I may work cheaper.

214
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:23,069
Please, not now.
Too fast, huh? Okay,

215
00:18:23,244 --> 00:18:29,275
tell me, did your uncle have any enemies?
Not that I know of.

216
00:18:30,654 --> 00:18:33,657
...and how about this house?
Who lives here?

217
00:18:33,658 --> 00:18:36,821
It belongs to a Major Simon Montague.

218
00:18:36,822 --> 00:18:40,005
He was a former business
partner of the baron's.

219
00:18:40,027 --> 00:18:44,712
When my uncle disappeared I was frantic.
So I called Major Montague

220
00:18:44,713 --> 00:18:47,018
and he offered to help me.

221
00:18:47,477 --> 00:18:52,282
...and what do you know about him?
My uncle trusted him implicitly,

222
00:18:52,283 --> 00:18:57,590
and still he treats me like a child.
Tells me not to worry.

223
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,013
Says that he's handling things.

224
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:04,290
And all the time I feel as
though I'm being watched.

225
00:19:06,462 --> 00:19:10,667
And he's been so sweet and
kind ever since my arrival.

226
00:19:10,668 --> 00:19:15,263
Getting kind of dark in here isn't it?
We were just talking about you.

227
00:19:15,314 --> 00:19:20,160
Something flattering I hope?
Maybe I should've listened a minute.

228
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:23,564
If there's anything warms my
heart it's finding out people like me

229
00:19:23,565 --> 00:19:27,570
as much as I like them.
I don't believe I've had the honor sir.

230
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:31,415
Mr Craig.
Hi Mr. Craig. Glad to see you.

231
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:34,860
I thought your name was Craig
I'm Craig too, that's quite a coincidence.

232
00:19:34,861 --> 00:19:38,055
Major Montague I met
Mr Craig on shipboard.

233
00:19:38,305 --> 00:19:42,870
Still a little seasick.
It's a pleasure knowing you, son.

234
00:19:42,871 --> 00:19:46,075
Anything I can do for you while you're
in the country, you just speak up.

235
00:19:46,076 --> 00:19:47,366
Thank you sir.

236
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:51,106
Would you have a cigar?
No thanks, I'm driving.

237
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:54,870
Craig, where have I
heard that name before?

238
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:01,015
Madame, there's a phone call for you.
Please take the message.

239
00:20:01,016 --> 00:20:03,970
After all Carlotta,
it may be important.

240
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:06,571
Yes, you're quite right.

241
00:20:08,306 --> 00:20:10,497
Excuse me Mr Craig.

242
00:20:15,115 --> 00:20:18,981
All right sir, now we'll quit playing possum.
Yeah.

243
00:20:19,361 --> 00:20:22,748
How do you do Mr McCloud?

244
00:20:23,486 --> 00:20:28,481
Craig is the name, Elliott Craig.
I was on shipboard...

245
00:20:30,015 --> 00:20:33,163
You know that...
You're a private detective.

246
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:36,606
Yeah, just call me Sam.

247
00:20:36,984 --> 00:20:40,508
Just to show you my heart's in the
right place I'm going to help you

248
00:20:40,509 --> 00:20:42,791
do a little detecting.
This way, son.

249
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:44,584
Coming dad.

250
00:20:45,236 --> 00:20:47,461
I may have a little surprise for you.

251
00:20:49,962 --> 00:20:52,685
You'll pardon us gentlemen,
this is Mr McCloud.

252
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:57,251
Mr McLoud I'd like you to meet...
The man in the picture! Baron Montay!

253
00:20:57,252 --> 00:21:01,136
How do you do?
She said you'd been snatched!

254
00:21:01,137 --> 00:21:05,049
You have my word for it, I'm not a mirage.

255
00:21:05,142 --> 00:21:09,708
Yeah, but she told me, she
seemed so... I don't get it.

256
00:21:09,709 --> 00:21:13,433
Such a lovely girl, the very flower
of young womanhood too.

257
00:21:13,434 --> 00:21:18,348
Perhaps Dr Lundau can tell you about her.
I believe you've met the doctor?

258
00:21:21,885 --> 00:21:25,769
Yes, we had a long talk outside.
Beautiful day, isn't it?

259
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:30,015
I said that.
Well Mr McCloud, as you perhaps know

260
00:21:30,016 --> 00:21:34,501
it is not the habit of a psychiatrist
to put on display the skeletons

261
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:39,727
in anyone's family closet. However,
I believe you are entitled to an explanation

262
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:43,212
of the strange behavior
of Baron Montay's wife.

263
00:21:43,234 --> 00:21:46,998
Wife? She just told me
she was his niece.

264
00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:51,204
Last week she was his little sister.
It is not funny, major.

265
00:21:51,205 --> 00:21:56,511
For the past six months Mrs Montay has been
suffering from an acute form of schizophrenia

266
00:21:57,012 --> 00:22:02,280
accompanied by visual elaborations and
increasingly severe paranoid delusions.

267
00:22:03,701 --> 00:22:05,847
And how is she mentally?

268
00:22:06,345 --> 00:22:10,349
Our friend Mr. McCloud is a Harvard man.
I am not.

269
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:13,554
Fairmount High, Cleveland.

270
00:22:13,555 --> 00:22:16,589
Won't you sit here, please?

271
00:22:19,122 --> 00:22:23,127
I'll try to simplify the case.
Make it easy on yourself

272
00:22:23,128 --> 00:22:25,000
I handle all these...

273
00:22:27,534 --> 00:22:31,378
Miss Montay has an obsession
that her own life is in danger.

274
00:22:31,379 --> 00:22:34,801
She believes that her uncle
has been kidnapped.

275
00:22:34,823 --> 00:22:40,661
Gee... I mean, why don't you bring
her in here and show her the baron?

276
00:22:40,952 --> 00:22:43,462
That's what I'd do.

277
00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:50,924
No señor. It would be too
severe a mental shock.

278
00:22:50,925 --> 00:22:55,759
My idea is to break down her
fear with suggestive therapy.

279
00:22:56,172 --> 00:22:59,576
Well, does she snap her cap very often?
I mean when you invite company for dinner

280
00:22:59,577 --> 00:23:01,699
do you take away her knife and fork?

281
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,143
She's only dangerous if
she's emotionally disturbed.

282
00:23:05,144 --> 00:23:08,908
You must have come across many similar
cases in your business, Mr McCloud.

283
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:13,274
Did you? Oh, me. Sure, I can take
those schizos or leave them alone

284
00:23:13,275 --> 00:23:16,902
and usually I leave them alone.
I figure that...

285
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:22,631
I must get back to the office and file some
fingernails, fingerprints... See you then.

286
00:23:23,329 --> 00:23:27,605
You know, my heart goes out
to that poor unfortunate girl.

287
00:23:28,015 --> 00:23:30,377
Her mind is all mixed up.

288
00:23:30,378 --> 00:23:35,104
It's down right pitiful. I suppose she
even said something about a map, huh?

289
00:23:35,105 --> 00:23:40,411
Map? Yeah, she even gave me one to hold
for her. Mysterious map, missing uncle.

290
00:23:41,193 --> 00:23:45,718
Pretty corny. There was something about the
way she looked that made me suspicious.

291
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:49,123
The way she looked I didn't care.
But you kept the map?

292
00:23:49,124 --> 00:23:54,915
Sure, why not? She may not have it
up here, but... hubba, hubba.

293
00:23:56,614 --> 00:23:58,566
Thank you Kismet.

294
00:23:58,737 --> 00:24:01,281
Now you watch yourself, son.

295
00:24:02,261 --> 00:24:04,167
Come in, Carlotta dear.

296
00:24:05,386 --> 00:24:09,776
Nutty as a fruitcake, with
all that beautiful frosting.

297
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:13,115
I was just saying to your friend Mr Craig
that anytime he's in the neighborhood

298
00:24:13,116 --> 00:24:15,820
he should feel free to drop
in and have a julep with us.

299
00:24:16,601 --> 00:24:17,681
If you all excuse me.

300
00:24:17,682 --> 00:24:21,166
Don't go major, you know the old saying
"three is company two is a crowd".

301
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:23,996
You'll take care of yourself, son.

302
00:24:26,013 --> 00:24:29,737
Here we are alone at last.
Goodbye.

303
00:24:29,738 --> 00:24:33,012
Do you know who that phone call was from?
Napoleon?

304
00:24:36,548 --> 00:24:39,582
Her schizo is about to phrenia.

305
00:24:39,952 --> 00:24:42,417
Why did I get up today?

306
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:47,481
I just spoke to my uncle.
That's funny, so did I.

307
00:24:47,482 --> 00:24:51,109
Who?
My uncle, Baron Montay.

308
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:56,432
He told me not to worry,
but I'm terribly disturbed.

309
00:24:56,454 --> 00:25:01,403
Emotionally?
Yes, he said he was safe.

310
00:25:01,421 --> 00:25:05,826
He's safe alright, I mean...
he's safe alright!

311
00:25:05,827 --> 00:25:08,470
But he's not safe, I know he isn't.

312
00:25:08,471 --> 00:25:10,732
No, he's in a terrible spot.

313
00:25:10,754 --> 00:25:13,202
But I feel he's in great danger.

314
00:25:13,325 --> 00:25:17,282
Yes, yes. He's in great danger,
but he's safe alright.

315
00:25:17,723 --> 00:25:20,566
He's safe. Sound like an umpire.

316
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:25,012
Don't you see? Someone forced
him to make that call.

317
00:25:25,013 --> 00:25:28,765
Someone who wants me to
believe that nothing is wrong.

318
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:34,425
Mr McCloud, I don't know what to do.
I'm at my wits' end!

319
00:25:34,426 --> 00:25:36,267
I passed there an hour ago.

320
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:39,511
What's the matter with you?
Me?

321
00:25:39,512 --> 00:25:42,740
You better take the ring back.

322
00:25:44,479 --> 00:25:49,786
Mr McCloud, Sam, you wouldn't
desert me, not now?

323
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:54,291
No, I just remembered I've got a date with
J. Edgar Hoover, kid never makes a move

324
00:25:54,292 --> 00:25:56,334
without me...
But Sam!

325
00:25:56,335 --> 00:25:59,438
You said we were in this thing together,
you said you'd stick with me

326
00:25:59,439 --> 00:26:02,262
till your dying breath.
And I'm getting too close to it.

327
00:26:02,263 --> 00:26:06,147
Don't get upset Miss Montay,
you just listen to the major

328
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:10,733
He's a very fine man.
He likes you.

329
00:26:10,755 --> 00:26:13,798
So they've been talking to you.
They've been telling you things.

330
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:17,843
You're crazy... I mean, you're being silly!
Nobody's been talking to me.

331
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:20,306
I haven't even been talking to myself.

332
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:24,011
Yes they have, they told you something.
And you believe them.

333
00:26:24,012 --> 00:26:27,366
No, I'm on your side.

334
00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:33,905
Now I know who's at the bottom of all this,
Major Simon Montague.

335
00:26:33,906 --> 00:26:38,551
No, we're in this together baby.
Please don't believe them, Sam.

336
00:26:38,552 --> 00:26:41,876
Say you'll help me.
Please.

337
00:26:41,877 --> 00:26:46,232
Please, baby, do it for mama.

338
00:26:49,327 --> 00:26:51,569
Mama knows best.

339
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:55,614
Darling promise me you'll guard
the map with your life.

340
00:26:55,615 --> 00:27:02,205
Yeah the map... map? The map.
Let me take this.

341
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:12,139
You can open the mail man later.
Gee... 6 o'clock already... so long.

342
00:27:12,838 --> 00:27:16,402
"Well, I got out of the house and was just
starting for my car when I realized

343
00:27:16,403 --> 00:27:19,606
me and my gat had parted company,
holster and all.

344
00:27:19,607 --> 00:27:22,611
I figured little Miss Screwball must
have lifted it when she kissed me.

345
00:27:22,612 --> 00:27:25,655
I started to go back for it
but I changed my mind.

346
00:27:25,656 --> 00:27:29,300
I spot a high window around the corner
of the house and decide to climb up

347
00:27:29,301 --> 00:27:33,665
and take a gander. I figured the only way
to get the inside dope is from the outside.

348
00:27:33,666 --> 00:27:36,112
Dope. So I scamper
up the hill in about three

349
00:27:36,235 --> 00:27:38,771
jumps like any other goat,
and take a sneek peek.

350
00:27:38,793 --> 00:27:43,399
And what do you know? The guy who told me
he couldn't walk is out of his wheelchair

351
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,962
and sashaying around chipper as a jaybird.

352
00:27:45,963 --> 00:27:49,567
Then I knew Carlotta wasn't nuts.
I get out my Brownie

353
00:27:49,568 --> 00:27:53,172
and I'm all set to snap exhibit A, when
laughing boy gets out of his chair

354
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:56,096
and starts for the window.
I figure he sees me.

355
00:27:56,097 --> 00:27:58,766
But no, he pulls up the
shade right in my kisser

356
00:27:58,789 --> 00:28:01,162
like it was ladies
night in a Turkish bath.

357
00:28:01,184 --> 00:28:06,490
I'm stymied, but only for a second. The
keyhole! Here's where my gadget pays off.

358
00:28:07,112 --> 00:28:10,155
The greatest invention since
the Albany night bolt.

359
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:13,669
This will do it I says.
Next stop Rogues Gallery.

360
00:28:18,847 --> 00:28:21,250
Watch the birdy... click.

361
00:28:21,251 --> 00:28:26,085
Oh, Carlotta.
What am I saying?

362
00:28:30,703 --> 00:28:33,266
He saw the baron.
He took a picture.

363
00:28:33,267 --> 00:28:35,469
Get that camera before
I take the hide off you.

364
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,501
All right.
There he goes.

365
00:28:39,315 --> 00:28:42,509
Hurry. Close the
gates, both gates.

366
00:29:06,632 --> 00:29:09,222
Step on it.

367
00:29:17,887 --> 00:29:20,731
Come on take this shortcut.
Head him off.

368
00:29:44,002 --> 00:29:45,989
Too fast for them.

369
00:29:46,211 --> 00:29:48,211
Hot rod.

370
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:53,556
We've lost him. He must have taken
the other road. Turn around!

371
00:30:03,949 --> 00:30:06,938
Hey you big road hog, why do you...

372
00:31:01,867 --> 00:31:07,135
Hello honey this is Joe.
Come on up Joe, where have you been?

373
00:31:11,841 --> 00:31:14,272
That Joe. What a man he must be.

374
00:31:14,645 --> 00:31:17,713
Don't let 'em in, they're
from the finance company.

375
00:31:19,892 --> 00:31:22,117
I must remember this address.

376
00:31:27,181 --> 00:31:29,532
That'll cool you off, Joe.

377
00:31:45,847 --> 00:31:48,729
Aha! Didn't think you'd do it
after that bath we had.

378
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,252
You doll, you.

379
00:31:50,253 --> 00:31:53,207
We both came through like men.

380
00:32:06,394 --> 00:32:10,306
Hello operator, get me the State Police.
Yeah, I'll hang on.

381
00:32:24,459 --> 00:32:27,733
Plenty rugged.
Smooth though.

382
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:34,981
Cuddles, huh?

383
00:32:38,758 --> 00:32:42,465
Operator? Never mind that call.

384
00:32:57,463 --> 00:33:01,819
Very thoughtful of you
to include the negative.

385
00:33:07,757 --> 00:33:11,121
When I came to I was playing
post office with the floor.

386
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:13,524
I had a lump on my head
the size of my head.

387
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:17,129
Inside Toscanini was conducting the
anvil chorus with real blacksmiths.

388
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:21,406
I looked at the bottle of old pile driver
and decided to stick to double malts.

389
00:33:23,659 --> 00:33:26,421
Then those kids with the hammer
started pounding again...

390
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:28,584
but the thumping wasn't in my head.

391
00:33:28,585 --> 00:33:33,742
There was somebody knocking on the door,
and it wasn't McCloud's door, it was my door.

392
00:33:33,752 --> 00:33:36,456
My door in the other room.

393
00:33:38,278 --> 00:33:41,401
Oh it's you.
Yes, here I am Mr Jackson.

394
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,925
My head...
How did they come out?

395
00:33:43,926 --> 00:33:45,607
Yanks 4, Cleveland 7.

396
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:49,011
Now, Mr Jackson a man of your
responsibility shouldn't drink.

397
00:33:49,012 --> 00:33:53,316
Well, who's drinking? I...
Oh... that's a bottle of bean bopper.

398
00:33:53,338 --> 00:33:55,491
I want my baby picture.

399
00:33:57,024 --> 00:34:01,068
Picture? Oh... wait a minute.

400
00:34:01,069 --> 00:34:03,979
Where are you going?
Just a second, wait.

401
00:34:06,256 --> 00:34:08,978
They got it. It's gone.
It's gone?

402
00:34:08,979 --> 00:34:11,259
Let me see, I had it in
here and I took it in there.

403
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:13,424
Oh, this would have to
happen to sweetie.

404
00:34:13,425 --> 00:34:18,732
No, it's not your baby's picture. Here's the
negative, have it printed some place else.

405
00:34:18,893 --> 00:34:23,761
I'm out of business. I'm retired. Remember
that if you have another baby, please.

406
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,982
Quiet, I'm thinking.

407
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:30,931
Boy, I've got things to do.
Important things to do.

408
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:35,656
What have I got to do?
Carlotta!

409
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:49,604
There he is, that's the fellow.
Get him.

410
00:34:50,015 --> 00:34:53,478
Watch him, he's one of the gang.
All right, what did you do with the baron?

411
00:34:53,479 --> 00:34:56,805
Come clean you gunza, we mean
business. Don't we, fellows?

412
00:34:56,904 --> 00:34:59,325
I beg your pardon,
what's going on here?

413
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,729
Don't try to look so innocent
with those blue point eyes

414
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:04,252
watch him he's got a knife.
Have you got a knife?

415
00:35:04,274 --> 00:35:07,517
Sure I've got a knife.
I'm the gardener.

416
00:35:07,518 --> 00:35:10,321
What did you think that I was last night?
A chrysanthemum? He tried to prune me.

417
00:35:10,322 --> 00:35:14,887
Hold it bud. Is there anyone living here
by the name of... Carlotta Montay?

418
00:35:14,888 --> 00:35:17,811
Who is Carlotta Montay?
You know who she is.

419
00:35:17,812 --> 00:35:20,975
She's staying here with Major Montague.
Who is Major Montague?

420
00:35:20,977 --> 00:35:25,041
This house belongs to the George Krandals,
they've been in South America for 4 months.

421
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:27,665
Six months.
Then he's sub-letting.

422
00:35:27,666 --> 00:35:32,021
Do you mind if we take a look inside?
No, please come along. Pardon me.

423
00:35:33,354 --> 00:35:33,953
This way.

424
00:35:33,954 --> 00:35:35,956
I'll show you they're all
probably hiding in here.

425
00:35:35,957 --> 00:35:37,247
Stick with me.

426
00:35:40,042 --> 00:35:43,606
What's this?
Looks like nobody home.

427
00:35:43,607 --> 00:35:46,811
Nothing personal about that I hope.
What do you think sarge?

428
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:48,132
I think a rebuke is in order.

429
00:35:48,133 --> 00:35:51,136
Wait a minute, don't get your badges
in an uproar, you've got this all wrong

430
00:35:51,137 --> 00:35:53,620
they fixed my car, they fixed
the gate, they fixed everything

431
00:35:53,621 --> 00:35:56,443
that's their racket they're trying to
make people think everybody's crazy.

432
00:35:56,465 --> 00:35:58,245
Yeah, but with you they had a head start.

433
00:35:58,267 --> 00:36:00,589
Wait a minute, you got to listen to me,
you got to trust me fellows

434
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:03,659
this is the biggest frame up
since Whistler's mother.

435
00:36:05,317 --> 00:36:07,999
Wait a minute.
Keep moving, you got a long drive

436
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,803
back to town.
Let me tell you something.

437
00:36:10,804 --> 00:36:13,406
What?
I like long drives.

438
00:36:13,407 --> 00:36:15,519
Get going.

439
00:36:15,691 --> 00:36:18,253
If you bother us again I'll personally
punch you in the nose so hard

440
00:36:18,254 --> 00:36:22,086
that it will look like other people's noses.
It might be worth it.

441
00:36:24,302 --> 00:36:27,866
Sorry we bothered you.
You're not a bad guy for a foreigner.

442
00:36:27,867 --> 00:36:31,671
But I'm going to be a citizen.
I'm studying for my examination.

443
00:36:31,672 --> 00:36:37,340
By the way, could you gentlemen
tell me... who was the eighth
President of the United States?

444
00:36:39,923 --> 00:36:41,795
So long bud.

445
00:36:55,785 --> 00:36:57,657
He's going around to the back.

446
00:36:57,667 --> 00:37:00,895
Well, you know what to do.
Sure I know what to do.

447
00:37:01,272 --> 00:37:06,278
Not that you fool. Why did he come back?
Why does he want to search the house?

448
00:37:06,279 --> 00:37:07,680
He's looking for clues.

449
00:37:07,681 --> 00:37:12,706
Clues, huh? He wants a clue to
Carlotta's whereabouts.

450
00:37:12,728 --> 00:37:15,796
See that he finds one.
This one.

451
00:37:20,298 --> 00:37:21,588
Find one.

452
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,794
Always looks so easy in
those Tarzan pictures.

453
00:39:33,557 --> 00:39:36,432
Her ring!

454
00:39:38,885 --> 00:39:42,591
Seacliff Lodge.
So that's where she is.

455
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:47,406
Never leave a clue.

456
00:40:07,804 --> 00:40:11,047
Well, I knew where the doll was,
my next move is to find her.

457
00:40:11,048 --> 00:40:14,251
So I get back into my
hot-rod special and start out.

458
00:40:14,252 --> 00:40:17,555
About an hour later I spot
a sign: Seacliff Lodge.

459
00:40:17,577 --> 00:40:21,942
So I go in to locate the girl
pretending I'm just another guest

460
00:40:21,943 --> 00:40:24,845
looking for a little quiet relaxation.

461
00:40:24,867 --> 00:40:30,897
The place is just what I figured. A ritzy
summer resort, complete with golf course.

462
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:36,762
Pardon me, how do you get
to the lodge from here?

463
00:40:36,763 --> 00:40:41,518
That's where I live, straight
ahead, you can't miss it.

464
00:40:42,611 --> 00:40:47,155
Did you notice if a good looking dark haired
girl checked in there last night?

465
00:40:47,177 --> 00:40:49,083
Can't talk.

466
00:40:50,702 --> 00:40:54,408
Care to play these last three holes?
It will take you right there.

467
00:40:55,107 --> 00:40:59,133
Okay, how about my car?
They'll send for it.

468
00:40:59,193 --> 00:41:04,221
Crawford's the name, Oliver J. Crawford.
Well, mine's Smithers.

469
00:41:05,161 --> 00:41:08,805
Nine iron. Care to shoot first?
Okay.

470
00:41:08,806 --> 00:41:12,432
Say, this girl last night did
you notice if she was alone?

471
00:41:13,252 --> 00:41:16,856
Care to make a small wager?
A dollar a hole?

472
00:41:16,857 --> 00:41:18,939
Did you notice if she had a...

473
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,849
You hit a full nine,
there's water down there.

474
00:41:37,605 --> 00:41:41,277
Missed it. Cup must have moved on me.

475
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:45,124
I feel like a pretty good
round today myself.

476
00:41:55,549 --> 00:41:58,777
Lucky I got over those traps.
I didn't see it.

477
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,112
Right in the cup.

478
00:42:15,055 --> 00:42:17,805
I'll concede that.
Thanks.

479
00:42:21,224 --> 00:42:23,595
For a minute there
I didn't think you had a ball.

480
00:42:23,618 --> 00:42:26,264
Tough luck old boy.
You're one down.

481
00:42:34,842 --> 00:42:37,671
Where's your ball?
Right here.

482
00:42:38,126 --> 00:42:40,033
Nice lie.

483
00:42:43,654 --> 00:42:46,657
Right on the green.
I can't even see the green.

484
00:42:46,658 --> 00:42:50,142
I can. Say Smithers, how about
that buck you owe me?

485
00:42:50,143 --> 00:42:52,847
I owe you?
A dollar a hole.

486
00:42:53,107 --> 00:42:57,431
Nice racket you got.
Thanks. George Washington.

487
00:42:57,432 --> 00:42:59,703
Where?
He's staying here, you know?

488
00:43:00,316 --> 00:43:02,438
Got the room next to mine.

489
00:43:02,439 --> 00:43:06,043
Keeps me up all night long playing
Yankee Doodle on his fife.

490
00:43:06,044 --> 00:43:10,400
Off key.
Why don't you tell Petrullo about it?

491
00:43:12,693 --> 00:43:17,499
Hurry up, quick, grab them, there they go.
I'm looking for you Chummy.

492
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,488
We're going to see the doctor.
Doctor?

493
00:43:21,345 --> 00:43:24,668
Sanitarium? You got me
wrong, I'm not crazy.

494
00:43:24,669 --> 00:43:29,435
I know, maybe you'd like some walnuts?

495
00:43:29,436 --> 00:43:32,198
Walnuts? Why don't you grab those
nuts, there's strudel in the noodle...

496
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:36,044
I want you.
But I'm okay, I'm sane I'll prove it to you.

497
00:43:36,045 --> 00:43:38,190
Watch this coordination.

498
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,881
It's the wrong hand.

499
00:43:44,536 --> 00:43:47,339
I'll practice a little. See you later.

500
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:49,742
Come on.
Easy, that's my pinball hand.

501
00:43:49,743 --> 00:43:53,147
We're going to see the doctor.
It's no use bud I'm not going with you.

502
00:43:53,148 --> 00:43:55,852
Let's see the doctor.

503
00:43:57,914 --> 00:44:00,538
Watch out or we'll never
get that down again.

504
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,707
That's better but there's a part missing.

505
00:44:07,487 --> 00:44:10,270
A thing like this could be permanent.

506
00:44:11,452 --> 00:44:12,653
Cuddles.

507
00:44:12,654 --> 00:44:15,457
Hello.
Do they have bellhops here?

508
00:44:15,458 --> 00:44:17,889
Welcome to Seacliff Lodge.

509
00:44:21,586 --> 00:44:24,429
The map? Where's the map?

510
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:27,233
You didn't bring it with you that's very bad.

511
00:44:27,234 --> 00:44:30,587
I didn't expect to see you here.
Get me out of this angle.

512
00:44:30,798 --> 00:44:33,342
Very bad.
Trying to choke somebody?

513
00:44:33,482 --> 00:44:37,567
I don't know what's going
on here but I'm not scared.

514
00:44:37,568 --> 00:44:40,556
You've got company, Ma'am.
Carlotta.

515
00:44:41,092 --> 00:44:45,617
Sam, I'm sorry.
That's alright baby.

516
00:44:45,618 --> 00:44:49,405
Why did I have to go and do this,
now I've got you into this mess too.

517
00:44:52,788 --> 00:44:55,110
Don't go feminine on me.
Alright.

518
00:44:55,111 --> 00:44:57,257
Don't go masculine either.

519
00:44:59,557 --> 00:45:04,742
Well.
I didn't know this was going to be formal.

520
00:45:04,764 --> 00:45:07,594
I'll be right with you boss.

521
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:13,175
Come over here and sit down son.
You and I are going to have a little talk.

522
00:45:13,176 --> 00:45:15,898
I'll do the talking,
you do the sitting.

523
00:45:15,899 --> 00:45:18,011
I'll do the talking.

524
00:45:19,664 --> 00:45:21,465
I'll do the sitting.

525
00:45:21,487 --> 00:45:24,240
The map, Kismet.
Didn't have it on him, Simon.

526
00:45:24,362 --> 00:45:25,762
No?

527
00:45:26,314 --> 00:45:29,717
That kind of changes things, don't it?
Yes, it does change things.

528
00:45:29,918 --> 00:45:33,562
Sam boy. Recently I offered
to buy from Baron Montay

529
00:45:33,563 --> 00:45:36,326
the mineral rights of a section of his land.

530
00:45:36,327 --> 00:45:41,292
Unfortunately the baron turned my offer
down. He came to this country to make

531
00:45:41,293 --> 00:45:45,138
a deal with somebody else.
Who is this someone else and

532
00:45:45,139 --> 00:45:48,462
what kind of mineral rights?
You're getting too inquisitive son.

533
00:45:48,463 --> 00:45:52,427
And that ain't healthy.
Maybe little Carlotta here

534
00:45:52,428 --> 00:45:56,833
is beginning to see the light.
You know I'm very fond of you Carlotta

535
00:45:56,834 --> 00:45:59,317
and I don't like to see
you holding out on me.

536
00:45:59,318 --> 00:46:06,192
Lay off of her you phoney... It's a good
thing you're here, I'd be brutal.

537
00:46:09,492 --> 00:46:11,854
Carlotta.
Uncle Stephen.

538
00:46:11,855 --> 00:46:16,860
Are you alright?
Yes child, they haven't harmed me.

539
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:20,866
Is that your uncle? He looks just
like the guy in the picture I took.

540
00:46:20,867 --> 00:46:25,472
You should have held on to it, that picture
might have spoiled everything for us.

541
00:46:25,473 --> 00:46:27,675
Light, please, Carlotta.

542
00:46:27,676 --> 00:46:32,983
Oh, Simon If you don't mind I'd like to
acquaint the baron with a few basic facts.

543
00:46:33,203 --> 00:46:39,590
You see monsieur le barone, we have you,
we have your niece, and...

544
00:46:39,612 --> 00:46:43,456
having Mr McCloud we have the map.

545
00:46:43,457 --> 00:46:45,284
Not yet, you haven't.

546
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:52,333
Yes, but before the chrysanthemum
blooms we will have it.

547
00:46:52,572 --> 00:46:54,876
Please put this away, yes?

548
00:46:56,675 --> 00:47:00,039
Come here, Willie.
Let's stop fooling around son.

549
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,482
I want that map and I want it now.

550
00:47:02,483 --> 00:47:04,925
What you want and what you're
going to get are two different things

551
00:47:04,926 --> 00:47:06,434
I'm not the giving kind.

552
00:47:13,458 --> 00:47:15,700
Temper, Kismet, temper.

553
00:47:15,701 --> 00:47:18,664
Don't be so rough with Sam
He can take it.

554
00:47:18,665 --> 00:47:23,134
The poor boy's dazed,
he don't know what's going on.

555
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:28,549
Oh, I'm sorry honey, I didn't
mean to get so fresh.

556
00:47:30,561 --> 00:47:31,943
It's you?

557
00:47:33,525 --> 00:47:37,169
Now, where's the map son?
Is that what you want?

558
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:40,694
Why didn't you say so?
You don't have to get it the hard way.

559
00:47:40,695 --> 00:47:43,257
Sam, don't.
What's the use? They'll beat it out of us

560
00:47:43,258 --> 00:47:44,699
anyway, we might as well tell them.

561
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,982
Go on Chummy, you tell them.

562
00:47:46,983 --> 00:47:49,545
I hid the map in a water
cooler in my office.

563
00:47:49,546 --> 00:47:51,548
He's lying, I've searched his office.

564
00:47:51,549 --> 00:47:55,473
You looked in the wrong water cooler,
the one I mean is in... Sam.

565
00:47:55,474 --> 00:47:58,478
We might as well tell them the truth.

566
00:47:58,479 --> 00:48:03,028
You'll find the map in a water-cooler
at the ferry building.

567
00:48:04,366 --> 00:48:06,568
Yeah, the ferry building.

568
00:48:06,569 --> 00:48:11,164
In the water cooler by the news stand
third cup from the top.

569
00:48:11,256 --> 00:48:15,420
We'll find out. Tony, should take you
about three hours to get to that

570
00:48:15,421 --> 00:48:17,886
ferry building and back. Get going son.

571
00:48:18,946 --> 00:48:24,253
Doctor, better register them as patients,
in case they should happen to meet

572
00:48:24,714 --> 00:48:29,199
with an accident, usual
papers will be filled out.

573
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,271
You see, if Tony doesn't
happen to find that map.

574
00:48:58,941 --> 00:49:01,007
James Collins?

575
00:49:08,293 --> 00:49:12,079
Sam, can you hear me?

576
00:49:14,862 --> 00:49:17,144
What's up baby?
That cigarette you saw me take

577
00:49:17,145 --> 00:49:20,388
from my uncle, there was
a message in it from him.

578
00:49:20,389 --> 00:49:22,871
We've two hours to get out of here.

579
00:49:22,872 --> 00:49:26,704
We've got nothing to worry about
till Tony gets back.

580
00:49:26,918 --> 00:49:29,139
They took all my clothes.
Mine too.

581
00:49:29,161 --> 00:49:31,785
They did?
Oh they did..

582
00:49:33,006 --> 00:49:36,249
Say, have you got a hairpin?
Sam this is no time to be thinking

583
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:37,852
about your looks.

584
00:49:37,853 --> 00:49:40,157
Here.
Oh, good.

585
00:49:43,901 --> 00:49:45,841
Say, how did you know
about that cigarette?

586
00:49:45,863 --> 00:49:50,869
My uncle never smokes so
when he asked me for a light I...

587
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:54,234
He wants us to get in touch
with a James Collins.

588
00:49:54,235 --> 00:49:57,109
Engineering Facts Corporation.

589
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,844
I've seen this done a thousand times.
Who is this James Collins?

590
00:50:01,845 --> 00:50:04,447
I don't know, but we've got to find him.

591
00:50:04,448 --> 00:50:08,853
It's always so simple, just put the hairpin
in the lock, give it a quick twist...

592
00:50:08,854 --> 00:50:12,880
Well, come on in.
Get up, we can play jacks later.

593
00:50:17,307 --> 00:50:19,734
Quick, vanish, quick.

594
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:30,043
Oh, it's you! Okay, take me away.

595
00:50:30,844 --> 00:50:35,850
I brung you some grub
I fixed it all myself.

596
00:50:35,851 --> 00:50:38,814
I haven't got much of an appetite,
if I could take a long walk.

597
00:50:38,815 --> 00:50:43,740
Ohhh, them there guys wouldn't let you.
You know Chummy I like you.

598
00:50:43,741 --> 00:50:47,385
You've got a funny way of showing it.
I'm still trying to get the corpuscles

599
00:50:47,386 --> 00:50:50,069
to move back in.
I'm sorry.

600
00:50:50,070 --> 00:50:52,455
You just don't know your own strength.

601
00:50:55,637 --> 00:50:59,802
You know Willie I like you too.
You do?

602
00:50:59,803 --> 00:51:03,767
Yes sir. What a physique.
Boulder Dam with legs.

603
00:51:03,768 --> 00:51:08,994
And look at those shoulders. And that arm.
Like a sack of door knobs.

604
00:51:09,016 --> 00:51:11,890
Recess.

605
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:14,367
I'm just kidding.

606
00:51:14,743 --> 00:51:19,611
Hey, Chummy, do you care
if I feel your muscle too?
No, go ahead.

607
00:51:20,971 --> 00:51:23,242
Look around it's there some place.

608
00:51:24,156 --> 00:51:26,427
There it is.
That's it.

609
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,225
It's just like a woman.

610
00:51:29,924 --> 00:51:34,519
Easy, everything you
touch turns to rigor mortis.

611
00:51:35,732 --> 00:51:37,873
You know Willie, with your
strength I bet you could

612
00:51:37,896 --> 00:51:40,176
take that radiator and just
pull it up by the roots

613
00:51:40,177 --> 00:51:42,860
and play it like an accordion.
Wouldn't that be fun?

614
00:51:42,861 --> 00:51:46,665
You could even take those bars
and just bend them apart, huh?

615
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:51,571
Aw, I don't like to brag.
Well, go ahead and brag.

616
00:51:51,593 --> 00:51:52,941
Alright.

617
00:52:01,366 --> 00:52:04,229
Oh, that's great Willie.
Gee you're strong.

618
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:06,992
You want I should tear out the radiator.

619
00:52:06,993 --> 00:52:10,317
No, that's okay, you've done enough,
you're wonderful.

620
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:14,723
You're solid spinach. You're great,
I'll buy you a rabbit later.

621
00:52:14,724 --> 00:52:19,159
Thanks very much.
I'll be seeing you Chummy.

622
00:52:38,857 --> 00:52:41,288
You got to be neat, you know.

623
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:55,810
Willie?

624
00:52:57,962 --> 00:53:00,917
Did you hear that?
Yes.

625
00:53:01,367 --> 00:53:04,561
Big detective outsmarted by an imbecile.

626
00:53:04,732 --> 00:53:08,095
We've got to get out of here.
In two hours though.

627
00:53:08,096 --> 00:53:10,098
We're caught like rats in a trap.

628
00:53:10,099 --> 00:53:15,367
At least we're a boy-rat and a girl-rat.

629
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:29,263
Here's your dinner.
Thank you.

630
00:53:29,285 --> 00:53:31,829
No use struggling.

631
00:53:38,778 --> 00:53:41,460
See, I told you there was no
use struggling. Come on.

632
00:53:41,461 --> 00:53:43,447
No, get the keys.

633
00:53:44,786 --> 00:53:46,948
I'll be your nurse, patient.

634
00:53:46,949 --> 00:53:49,778
Oh, great.
This is where I get the new clothes.

635
00:53:51,475 --> 00:53:54,457
We'd better split up when we get
downstairs and meet at my car.

636
00:53:54,458 --> 00:53:58,302
You can't miss it it's a great convertible
job with a horn that goes "dadadada".

637
00:53:58,303 --> 00:53:59,905
It's a conservative model.

638
00:53:59,906 --> 00:54:02,309
Yes, but suppose they took the keys.

639
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:05,418
Don't need them, there's a trick
you can do with the wires.

640
00:54:16,508 --> 00:54:18,249
Somebody's coming.
Act like a nurse.

641
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:20,042
Act like a patient.

642
00:54:23,197 --> 00:54:27,394
There, there.
Oh nurse?

643
00:54:27,563 --> 00:54:29,151
Phenobarbitol.

644
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:35,353
I think I do this too well.
Come on.

645
00:54:37,056 --> 00:54:39,760
Wait a minute, let's see what's in here.

646
00:54:40,981 --> 00:54:43,664
There's nothing here but this
mangy old piece of moth bait.

647
00:54:43,665 --> 00:54:46,540
It's mine.
Yours? Pretty, isn't it.

648
00:54:47,070 --> 00:54:49,340
We can't use this. Come on.

649
00:54:49,673 --> 00:54:52,263
When we get to the door
we'll make a break for it.

650
00:54:53,719 --> 00:54:55,591
Hi you stranger.

651
00:54:57,083 --> 00:54:59,707
How do you do my dear?

652
00:54:59,887 --> 00:55:04,755
Going around with a pretty nurse I see,
you'll be getting out of here in no time.

653
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:08,483
He's one of us.

654
00:55:10,982 --> 00:55:14,369
How many branches does
our government consist of?

655
00:55:14,907 --> 00:55:18,580
Our government consists
of three branches.

656
00:55:18,832 --> 00:55:23,587
What are the three branches
of our government?

657
00:55:24,881 --> 00:55:29,271
The three branches of our government are...

658
00:55:29,447 --> 00:55:33,837
The legislative, the executive
and the judicial.

659
00:55:35,054 --> 00:55:40,322
What does the legislative branch of our
government do?

660
00:55:43,866 --> 00:55:46,349
It makes the laws.

661
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:50,714
What does the executive branch of our
government do?

662
00:55:50,715 --> 00:55:53,478
It carries out the law.

663
00:55:53,479 --> 00:55:55,671
Sneaking out, stranger?

664
00:55:57,244 --> 00:55:58,786
It's you.

665
00:56:00,248 --> 00:56:01,388
Practicing again.

666
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:03,043
Don't leave me.

667
00:56:03,212 --> 00:56:05,084
How delightful.

668
00:56:05,656 --> 00:56:09,169
Wonderful.
Wait a minute.

669
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:11,783
Take it easy, Cuddles.
Cuddles?

670
00:56:11,784 --> 00:56:13,770
Look I was j...

671
00:56:14,347 --> 00:56:17,310
Marvelous!
Come here you coward.

672
00:56:17,311 --> 00:56:19,662
Look you could get in trouble...

673
00:56:20,035 --> 00:56:23,548
Why you dirty rat!

674
00:56:25,723 --> 00:56:27,025
Nothing personal.

675
00:56:27,725 --> 00:56:31,751
Great.
Come here, come here...

676
00:56:36,938 --> 00:56:39,973
Why, you stupid, you...

677
00:56:41,384 --> 00:56:43,131
Come on, let's...

678
00:56:47,352 --> 00:56:49,737
Hey, Willie, you go that way.

679
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:54,589
Hey, I don't see him.

680
00:56:56,604 --> 00:56:59,673
Fan out Willie, let's search
the woods. Fan out.

681
00:57:05,456 --> 00:57:07,602
Friend.

682
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,744
How did you get rid of them?
You just couldn't stand the details baby.

683
00:57:11,745 --> 00:57:14,494
I just hope I didn't
slug them too hard.

684
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:19,142
It's a good thing we're downhill.
I'll release the brake.

685
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,723
What are you doing now?
I'll show you the trick with the wires.

686
00:57:25,724 --> 00:57:27,915
We don't need the key.

687
00:57:44,608 --> 00:57:47,233
What a time to hit the jackpot.

688
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:03,074
You do better with your knife.
Shut up.

689
00:58:03,935 --> 00:58:07,767
What happened? Hey, I'm driving.

690
00:58:08,221 --> 00:58:11,369
I'll take it through here it gets a little rough.
Thanks.

691
00:58:13,228 --> 00:58:15,870
As soon as we get to the city
we'll call Mr Collins.

692
00:58:15,871 --> 00:58:18,554
Or better yet we'll go to your office
and get the map and then we'll go...

693
00:58:18,555 --> 00:58:20,396
Hold it.
What's the matter?

694
00:58:20,397 --> 00:58:23,500
I got news for you Miss Montay
I'm bowing out.

695
00:58:23,522 --> 00:58:26,544
But Sam you can't.
I'm forcing myself.

696
00:58:26,566 --> 00:58:28,768
This kind of life is too
rich for my blood.

697
00:58:28,769 --> 00:58:32,613
The little I've got left. I'll get you
the map and we'll call it quits.

698
00:58:32,614 --> 00:58:37,059
Tell me Mr McCloud. Are you always afraid
of old men with phoney southern accents?

699
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:42,367
What do I owe you? All I know is you came
into my office with a phoney story and a ring

700
00:58:42,427 --> 00:58:45,257
... and now I ain't got the ring
and I'm stuck with the story.

701
00:58:46,192 --> 00:58:48,675
Put this top up.
It's going to rain.

702
00:58:48,676 --> 00:58:51,140
It never rains at this time of the year.

703
00:58:56,025 --> 00:58:57,327
Orange juice.

704
00:58:57,688 --> 00:59:01,492
There you are.
Ronnie Jackson, photographer for babies?

705
00:59:01,493 --> 00:59:02,894
That's me.

706
00:59:02,895 --> 00:59:07,525
Where's Sam McCloud?
He's out of town which is a tough break for all of us.

707
00:59:07,741 --> 00:59:11,585
So you've been playing detective.
Yeah and I'm through playing sister.

708
00:59:11,586 --> 00:59:16,151
The last 24 hours I've been knocked out,
shot at, beaten up, knocked out again

709
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:17,433
and put through the ringer.

710
00:59:17,434 --> 00:59:20,998
And if I'm still alive it's only because the
insurance company doesn't want to give up.

711
00:59:20,999 --> 00:59:23,430
They're afraid it would break them.

712
00:59:24,604 --> 00:59:29,329
Here's your map Miss Montay.
Right water cooler but the wrong office.

713
00:59:29,330 --> 00:59:30,872
Good bye.

714
00:59:31,793 --> 00:59:37,904
Alright. Goodbye Sam.
I mean Mr Jackson.

715
00:59:39,883 --> 00:59:45,151
Bye. And I don't mean see you later.
So long sister.

716
00:59:56,786 --> 01:00:01,311
Wait a minute, you can't go out like that,
you're soaked to the skin.

717
01:00:01,312 --> 01:00:03,955
I'll manage.
Hold steady.

718
01:00:03,956 --> 01:00:06,938
Why do women always act like women.

719
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,301
Here are a few things.
Who's things?

720
01:00:09,302 --> 01:00:11,414
Mine, pick out what you need.

721
01:00:11,465 --> 01:00:14,509
The ones with the lace are still at the laundry.
May I change...

722
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:17,818
No, it's my room.
Over here behind the screen.

723
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:20,477
You're not a detective, you act like one.

724
01:00:20,478 --> 01:00:23,307
Well, I ain't exactly
a cream puff sister.

725
01:00:26,325 --> 01:00:29,200
Guy could use water wings in this business.

726
01:00:31,212 --> 01:00:36,519
Oh Ronnie, I just wanted you to know,
I'm not really angry with you.

727
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:41,163
Why not?
I'm very grateful for all you've done for me.

728
01:00:41,185 --> 01:00:45,416
Even if you were Sam McCloud you
couldn't have accomplished more.

729
01:00:45,592 --> 01:00:48,935
Look, don't red apple me.
From now on I'm going to stick

730
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:52,371
to watch the birdie and
leave the chicks alone.

731
01:00:54,604 --> 01:00:56,967
I think you're a very brave man.

732
01:00:56,968 --> 01:01:00,051
I know a sniveling coward when I see one.

733
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:02,345
Hi you sniv.

734
01:01:02,375 --> 01:01:05,738
But I've no one else to turn to,
won't you help me?

735
01:01:05,739 --> 01:01:07,029
No.

736
01:01:07,842 --> 01:01:10,925
Please.
Oh no you don't. What kind of a sucker

737
01:01:10,926 --> 01:01:15,511
do you take me for? Just because
you're a girl and I'm a boy and you're

738
01:01:15,512 --> 01:01:19,737
throwing those big blue eyes at me
and you let me put my arms around you

739
01:01:19,738 --> 01:01:22,380
and you let me hold you close
even closer

740
01:01:22,381 --> 01:01:25,690
you think you can get me
to do anything you want.

741
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:30,571
What do you want baby?

742
01:01:30,593 --> 01:01:34,584
Darling, the first thing we got to do...
We're doing it.

743
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,361
We've got to find James Collins.

744
01:01:38,434 --> 01:01:43,268
Collins... yes. No,
we got to get out of here

745
01:01:43,290 --> 01:01:46,893
this is the first place those characters will
look. I don't want that Cuddles playing

746
01:01:46,894 --> 01:01:48,896
mumbly peg on my throat.
Take those off.

747
01:01:48,897 --> 01:01:51,379
What?
I mean... put this on.

748
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:53,582
I better roll these up first.

749
01:01:53,583 --> 01:01:56,014
Where's my hat?

750
01:02:00,493 --> 01:02:03,216
Oh, it's you Mrs Fong.
Mr Jackson, stop pushing me.

751
01:02:03,217 --> 01:02:06,941
I'm sorry. Hurry.
I'm very disappointed in you.

752
01:02:07,242 --> 01:02:10,646
You take a picture of Sonny
smiling for the first time in his life.

753
01:02:10,747 --> 01:02:13,429
And then you gave me the wrong...
Don't worry about a thing Mrs Fong

754
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:15,472
I'll give you your money back.
Hurry.

755
01:02:15,473 --> 01:02:18,035
But I don't want my money back
I want a picture of Sonny smiling

756
01:02:18,036 --> 01:02:20,341
for the first time in his life.

757
01:02:22,382 --> 01:02:25,025
Here they come. Hurry up.

758
01:02:25,026 --> 01:02:27,775
Come on, let's go while we're still here.

759
01:02:28,591 --> 01:02:31,660
Don't worry about a thing,
I'll send you a check.

760
01:02:33,237 --> 01:02:36,192
But you gave me the wrong negative.

761
01:02:46,194 --> 01:02:49,777
Well our next move is to
contact Mr James Collins.

762
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:53,803
His secretary said he had a date that
night at a spot called the "Le Poulet D'Or"

763
01:02:53,804 --> 01:02:57,689
From here in we had no worries
Montague and his cute little playmates

764
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:00,973
they were washed up,
through, lost in the shuffle.

765
01:03:00,974 --> 01:03:05,699
"Poulet D'Or" was our next stop, but we
didn't look exactly like café society

766
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:08,583
So I blew the bankroll to
rent a tuxedo for myself

767
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:12,709
and an evening gown for Carlotta.
Boy did she stack up.

768
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:15,433
I guess you only get out of a
thing what you put into it.

769
01:03:15,434 --> 01:03:19,598
An hour later we were at the "Poulet D'Or",
one of those real swanky cafés

770
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:21,666
where they eat mink for breakfast.

771
01:03:27,811 --> 01:03:30,645
Mr Whitebow has been waiting.

772
01:03:30,776 --> 01:03:33,307
Mr Collins' table,
he's expecting us.

773
01:03:33,330 --> 01:03:36,505
Yes, Mr Collins.
He's right there by the window.

774
01:03:39,227 --> 01:03:43,951
Yes, there he is.
This way please.

775
01:03:43,952 --> 01:03:50,267
Just a minute bud. Tell that blonde at
that table she's wanted on the phone.

776
01:03:50,422 --> 01:03:53,650
Pronto.
Certainly, sir.

777
01:03:55,649 --> 01:04:00,723
Pardon me, you're wanted on the telephone miss.
If you'll excuse me.

778
01:04:02,298 --> 01:04:04,380
Mr Collins, we'd like to
speak to you for a while.

779
01:04:04,741 --> 01:04:08,144
I don't believe I've had the...
Sit down, start talking baby.

780
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:12,390
My name is Carlotta Montay,
my uncle is Baron Montay.

781
01:04:12,391 --> 01:04:16,996
Baron Montay?
I don't think I've ever...

782
01:04:16,997 --> 01:04:19,428
My uncle told us to
get in touch with you.

783
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:27,130
I'm sorry, I think you have the wrong man.
Waiter, my check please.

784
01:04:27,131 --> 01:04:30,245
Does this map mean anything to you?

785
01:04:38,987 --> 01:04:40,973
Where is the baron?

786
01:04:42,071 --> 01:04:45,955
Henry! The waiter said you
had a phone call for me.

787
01:04:45,956 --> 01:04:47,457
I will check it for you, madame.

788
01:04:47,479 --> 01:04:50,866
The baron had an important appointment this
Wednesday afternoon in Washington.

789
01:04:51,043 --> 01:04:53,314
In his office, at the Pilgrim Hotel.

790
01:04:53,767 --> 01:04:55,929
Someone must keep that appointment.

791
01:04:55,930 --> 01:04:58,713
Someone will but it won't be
the right Baron Montay.

792
01:04:58,734 --> 01:05:01,737
Right, our first move
is to get the local police.

793
01:05:01,738 --> 01:05:03,860
No, you stay here Miss Montay.

794
01:05:03,861 --> 01:05:06,735
These men are killers.
Then I'll stay here too.

795
01:05:06,785 --> 01:05:08,306
Come on.
Okay.

796
01:05:08,307 --> 01:05:10,688
If we're not back in forty-five
minutes call the police.

797
01:05:10,689 --> 01:05:12,642
All of them. Check.

798
01:05:14,235 --> 01:05:16,557
The tenth precinct police station
is the closest.

799
01:05:16,558 --> 01:05:20,080
Good, we'll call from there.
But the sooner we get this

800
01:05:20,081 --> 01:05:22,366
into the hands of
the FBI the better.

801
01:05:23,447 --> 01:05:25,529
Baron Montay's appointment
in Washington Wednesday

802
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:27,516
was with the State department

803
01:05:28,013 --> 01:05:33,119
This thing is dynamite. Look Mr Collins,
just how do you figure in this deal?

804
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:38,277
I'm a geologist. I worked with Baron Montay
in San Dimas in fact I drew up this map for him.

805
01:05:38,287 --> 01:05:41,800
It shows the location of a
great deposit of cryolite.

806
01:05:42,152 --> 01:05:45,266
Well I don't see anything.
It's in code.

807
01:05:45,877 --> 01:05:49,220
Yesterday morning I got a phone call,
the voice exactly like Baron Montay's.

808
01:05:49,221 --> 01:05:52,224
Whoever it was said that there
had been a change in plans

809
01:05:52,225 --> 01:05:55,148
that the land was no longer for sale.
Do you realize what that means?

810
01:05:55,149 --> 01:05:56,550
Well, not exactly.

811
01:05:56,551 --> 01:06:00,828
It means that somebody, some other
government perhaps, is after that cryolite.

812
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:07,617
Cryolite, huh?
Well, we can't let them get it.

813
01:06:08,668 --> 01:06:09,909
What's cryolite?

814
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:16,021
It's an ore. Containing crypto-bar.
Crypto-bar? We can't let them get that!

815
01:06:16,198 --> 01:06:20,064
What's crypto-bar?
The source of uranium.

816
01:06:20,204 --> 01:06:25,152
Uranium! Now I got you,
I read Buck Rogers, too.

817
01:06:29,817 --> 01:06:32,566
Must be that right front. Come on.

818
01:06:34,503 --> 01:06:37,043
You know I had a hunch this thing
was much bigger than it looked.

819
01:06:41,232 --> 01:06:45,178
That's funny, it's okay.
Come on.

820
01:06:53,889 --> 01:06:57,276
Hey, Mr Collins, we're here.

821
01:07:00,458 --> 01:07:03,652
Blood. And it ain't mine, it's red.

822
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:08,049
Keep cool Ronnie. The murder weapon.

823
01:07:09,350 --> 01:07:12,419
Find the owner of this gun
and you got the killer.

824
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:15,305
It's mine.
My gun!

825
01:07:17,281 --> 01:07:20,064
It's got my fingerprints on it.

826
01:07:21,086 --> 01:07:24,837
I don't care if she has got a girlfriend
I'm going home and hit the hay.

827
01:07:25,051 --> 01:07:28,883
I just don't go for any blind dates.
I'd rather be caught dead.

828
01:07:30,378 --> 01:07:32,968
Okay, call her up.

829
01:07:41,353 --> 01:07:43,784
Hey you.
Who me?

830
01:07:44,157 --> 01:07:46,248
You don't expect to get
away with this, do you?

831
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:48,241
But I tell you I didn't
do it, I didn't do it.

832
01:07:48,242 --> 01:07:52,987
Of course you didn't do it. This fire
hydrant just sneaked up on you, huh?

833
01:07:53,009 --> 01:07:56,172
Oh that!
Let me see your driver's license.

834
01:07:56,173 --> 01:07:59,596
You got me all wrong officer,
this isn't my car.

835
01:07:59,618 --> 01:08:02,541
Oh, it isn't, huh?
I don't drive, I drink a lot, I get nosebleeds.

836
01:08:02,542 --> 01:08:05,304
What are doing here?
I was just cleaning.

837
01:08:05,305 --> 01:08:07,668
Trying to roll that drunk?
No, I wouldn't think of it.

838
01:08:07,669 --> 01:08:11,740
How far could I roll him? Besides some
of my best friends are drunks.

839
01:08:12,315 --> 01:08:17,420
I was just... well I got to go now, it's been fun.
(Not too fast looks suspicious.)

840
01:08:17,442 --> 01:08:20,525
So long, it's been fun.
(Stop saying that.)

841
01:08:20,526 --> 01:08:24,118
Goodbye now, I got to run now.

842
01:08:25,493 --> 01:08:27,125
Hey fellow.

843
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:32,927
Hey, stop or I shoot.

844
01:08:46,921 --> 01:08:50,445
Well, that takes care of him,
he's a real help to us that boy.

845
01:08:50,446 --> 01:08:55,155
What about the girl?
Carlotta is no problem, we have the map.

846
01:08:58,457 --> 01:09:01,660
"When I told Carlotta they'd rubbed out
Collins it was quite a blow.

847
01:09:01,661 --> 01:09:03,543
But the kid bounced back like a rubber ball.

848
01:09:03,544 --> 01:09:07,774
A nice soft rubber ball. Too bad I
wasn't in the mood to play catch.

849
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:12,235
I was in for keeps now:
Ronnie Jackson wanted for murder.

850
01:09:12,236 --> 01:09:16,040
Well, if we were going to save the doll's
uncle and Mrs Jackson's boy Ronnie

851
01:09:16,041 --> 01:09:17,962
we had to get
something on that gang.

852
01:09:17,963 --> 01:09:20,486
That meant our next stop
had to be Washington.

853
01:09:20,487 --> 01:09:23,490
But we needed dough to get there and
little Carlotta came through.

854
01:09:23,491 --> 01:09:26,954
We got the last two seats on a
plane headed east, and by midnight

855
01:09:26,955 --> 01:09:29,197
we were playing tag
with the Rockies.

856
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:32,842
Carlotta was very sweet.
She looked after me like a mother.

857
01:09:32,843 --> 01:09:35,344
I guess she wanted to make
sure I didn't get away.

858
01:09:35,366 --> 01:09:38,509
And for a disguise I was wearing
a ten o'clock shadow.

859
01:09:38,531 --> 01:09:42,495
I had to play it cagey. The only thing
that bothered me was the altitude.

860
01:09:42,496 --> 01:09:46,420
I knew it would get me, I get airsick
when I step on a thick carpet.

861
01:09:46,421 --> 01:09:51,814
We hit Washington about noon the next day
and we grabbed a cab for the Pilgrim Hotel.

862
01:09:51,889 --> 01:09:54,652
Well, this was the end the ride. The payoff.

863
01:09:54,653 --> 01:09:59,966
Ronnie Jackson vs Mint Julep Montague.
My brain pitted against his.

864
01:10:00,821 --> 01:10:03,126
He had the brain and I had the pit.

865
01:10:10,274 --> 01:10:12,756
Suppose they haven't got a
room near my uncle's suite?

866
01:10:12,757 --> 01:10:15,340
You just toss that smile at him
honey and he'll give us the joint.

867
01:10:15,341 --> 01:10:18,045
Thanks, Ronnie. Look.

868
01:10:20,327 --> 01:10:22,758
It's nice to see you again, baron.
Thank you.

869
01:10:26,175 --> 01:10:28,738
I guess old shortnin' bread
joins 'em later.

870
01:10:28,739 --> 01:10:30,981
I'll see about that room.

871
01:10:30,982 --> 01:10:33,544
Hey Bud, we'd like to talk to you about...
One moment please.

872
01:10:33,545 --> 01:10:35,627
Can you tell me the number
of Baron Montay's suite?

873
01:10:35,628 --> 01:10:40,896
Sorry, he's out of town.
I'm Mr Dawson of the State Department.

874
01:10:41,716 --> 01:10:46,152
Oh yes, he's expecting you. Suite 14C.
Thank you.

875
01:10:48,485 --> 01:10:50,968
We'd like a room please,
something on the 14th floor.

876
01:10:50,969 --> 01:10:51,889
Sorry we haven't a thing.

877
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:54,012
What about those rooms for
Hennessey and McCarthy?

878
01:10:54,013 --> 01:10:55,854
And Kelly?
And Schultz?

879
01:10:55,855 --> 01:10:58,730
Oh yes, will you please register?

880
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:01,222
I thought you said you
didn't have a room.

881
01:11:01,223 --> 01:11:03,385
Well, you see, if you were
with the convention I could...

882
01:11:03,386 --> 01:11:06,028
Sure we're with the convention.

883
01:11:06,029 --> 01:11:09,702
You certainly don't look like a detective.

884
01:11:16,243 --> 01:11:20,394
Well, I'm not exactly a detective,
I'm more of a stool pidgeon.

885
01:11:21,450 --> 01:11:24,564
But they're at the other hotel...
Well look...

886
01:11:29,741 --> 01:11:35,009
We must be off old boy, cheerio, pit pit,
top hole and all that sort of rot... Come, come.

887
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:40,154
We mustn't be late for tea.
I hate soggy crumpets, you know.

888
01:11:40,155 --> 01:11:42,381
So do I.
Stiff up bud.

889
01:11:44,922 --> 01:11:48,196
Read all about it.
Get your latest.

890
01:11:50,329 --> 01:11:52,714
Police capture killer.

891
01:11:53,533 --> 01:11:56,136
They got me.
New York gang slayer jailed.

892
01:11:56,137 --> 01:11:59,100
It's a New York murder
he's yelling about.

893
01:11:59,101 --> 01:12:01,805
Sure, I'm just a San Francisco murderer.

894
01:12:01,925 --> 01:12:03,706
Don't know how much
more of this I can take.

895
01:12:03,707 --> 01:12:06,269
You've had me in hot water so long
I feel like a tea-bag.

896
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:08,352
Well, why don't you quit,
I can take it from here.

897
01:12:08,453 --> 01:12:11,966
Oh sure, now that you got me over a barrel,
now that I'm wanted for murder.

898
01:12:12,058 --> 01:12:15,252
For murder. You want me to quit?
Let me...

899
01:12:18,807 --> 01:12:21,389
Did you hear that bell ringing?
What bell?

900
01:12:21,411 --> 01:12:24,112
They just rang for ice water in 14C.

901
01:12:24,134 --> 01:12:28,969
And who do you think is going to bring
it up? Me, not my chambermaid.

902
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:46,003
Mr Dawson. Boy, bring it back!

903
01:12:46,004 --> 01:12:47,485
I want to talk to you.

904
01:12:47,486 --> 01:12:50,760
Which way son?
To the right Major Montague.

905
01:12:52,333 --> 01:12:55,055
Hey boy, give me a hand with these bags.

906
01:12:55,056 --> 01:12:58,219
This is ice water. There's a blonde
in 14A who's on fire. I'll check...

907
01:12:58,220 --> 01:13:01,944
Cut the comedy and get these bags.
It's an emergency, she says...

908
01:13:01,945 --> 01:13:04,934
Come on.
Okay, just let me drop this.

909
01:13:07,553 --> 01:13:11,305
Don't push me around.
My dues are paid too you know.

910
01:13:11,518 --> 01:13:13,630
Alright, Tony.

911
01:13:17,286 --> 01:13:18,999
Let's go.

912
01:13:21,732 --> 01:13:26,600
Oh boy, you, that portfolio...
The office is in there, Simon.

913
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:30,534
Put the bags in that room
and the portfolio in the office.

914
01:13:34,830 --> 01:13:38,935
Hey Baron, how was it, easy?
I handled Mrs Dawson beautifully.

915
01:13:40,397 --> 01:13:42,519
Nice having you with us
again Baron Montay.

916
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:46,511
Will you be in Washington long?
Not long, a few days perhaps.

917
01:13:46,686 --> 01:13:51,030
Let me tell you about Dawson.
Not now, wait till we're alone.

918
01:13:51,052 --> 01:13:53,350
Would you like me
to open the window for you?

919
01:13:53,372 --> 01:13:55,096
No, it's quite alright,
thank you.

920
01:13:55,097 --> 01:13:58,610
Yes baron.
Oh, boy.

921
01:14:02,347 --> 01:14:05,575
Oh, boy.
Coming.

922
01:14:07,794 --> 01:14:11,158
Will that be all sir?
That's all thank you.

923
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:14,592
And the other boy?
Just a minute young man.

924
01:14:18,088 --> 01:14:20,280
Give this to your friend.
Oh, thank you sir.

925
01:14:27,581 --> 01:14:29,169
Okay sucker.

926
01:14:39,918 --> 01:14:42,462
You'd have been proud of me, I tell you.

927
01:14:42,681 --> 01:14:45,829
Not Kismet. He's never
proud of anybody.

928
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:14,380
Well?

929
01:15:15,353 --> 01:15:17,586
The baron's a stubborn old man.

930
01:15:17,608 --> 01:15:22,915
He still hasn't talked, he pretends
he doesn't know the code.

931
01:15:23,536 --> 01:15:25,408
Give me that.

932
01:15:35,913 --> 01:15:39,107
Well, if it ain't Chummy.

933
01:15:39,238 --> 01:15:42,641
Look Willie, we're friends, pals, remember?

934
01:15:42,642 --> 01:15:46,526
Sure. I like you. Let's go tell
the fellows you're here.

935
01:15:46,527 --> 01:15:49,691
No, Willie. They'd ruin everything.
We're friends, let's be alone.

936
01:15:49,692 --> 01:15:52,615
Here, have some walnuts.
Are them yours?

937
01:15:52,616 --> 01:15:55,890
Slip this into your pocket.
Gee, thanks.

938
01:15:56,301 --> 01:16:01,978
Have some more.
I like walnuts better than almost anything.

939
01:16:02,149 --> 01:16:07,855
Except coconuts. I hate them.
They don't fit in here.

940
01:16:08,197 --> 01:16:13,061
And they will soon.
Just forget that you ever saw me.

941
01:16:13,083 --> 01:16:17,917
I'll bring you some reachy nuts, you can crack
'em with your eyelids. They're more fun.

942
01:16:20,894 --> 01:16:23,325
You're a pal.

943
01:16:49,452 --> 01:16:54,720
You know who I just seen?
That is the part that's in code.

944
01:16:56,742 --> 01:17:00,285
Go ahead. What are you doing?
Crackin' nuts.

945
01:17:00,307 --> 01:17:03,110
Guess who give 'em to me.
Oh, sit down.

946
01:17:03,111 --> 01:17:05,612
He was right outsi...
Stop interrupting.

947
01:17:05,634 --> 01:17:08,154
But I just wanted...
Shut up.

948
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:11,671
That ain't no nice way
to talk to a person...

949
01:17:13,805 --> 01:17:16,190
Alright, just for that
I'll keep quiet.

950
01:17:21,295 --> 01:17:23,087
Any luck?

951
01:17:24,379 --> 01:17:27,423
Thought you looked a little thin.
Anything in the portfolio?

952
01:17:27,424 --> 01:17:30,667
Just this, they're too smart
to put anything on paper.

953
01:17:30,668 --> 01:17:34,352
I'd go out there and shoot it out
with them but it's so messy.

954
01:17:34,353 --> 01:17:36,738
I've looked all through
the filing cabinet.

955
01:17:36,836 --> 01:17:39,666
We got to get something out
of the baby or we're dead ducks.

956
01:17:40,481 --> 01:17:43,223
"We got to get something out of
the baby or we're dead ducks."

957
01:17:43,245 --> 01:17:44,992
I said that.

958
01:17:48,692 --> 01:17:50,414
What is it?
That's a recording machine.

959
01:17:50,415 --> 01:17:51,815
It repeats what you say.

960
01:17:51,816 --> 01:17:54,259
You know, for a guy too fat to
hold a secretary in his lap.

961
01:17:54,260 --> 01:17:56,942
Do you know how to work it?
Sure, you just speak into this mike

962
01:17:56,943 --> 01:17:57,983
and make a record.

963
01:17:57,984 --> 01:17:59,545
That's it.
That's what?

964
01:17:59,546 --> 01:18:02,389
You work the machine
I'll get them to talk.

965
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:05,153
This is one of the best
ideas I ever had.

966
01:18:05,154 --> 01:18:08,028
Marvelous what you can
do when you're thinking.

967
01:18:08,218 --> 01:18:10,649
Okay, lead them in.

968
01:18:14,888 --> 01:18:18,560
What was that?
I don't know, it came from in there.

969
01:18:31,791 --> 01:18:35,995
Well, Carlotta. A chambermaid now, huh?

970
01:18:35,996 --> 01:18:38,659
You see she's dangerous
we've got to get rid of her.

971
01:18:38,660 --> 01:18:41,262
Oh, let her go Kismet.
We don't want any trouble here.

972
01:18:41,363 --> 01:18:45,768
But that's no trouble. I'll put her in a trunk
and send her to my brother in California.

973
01:18:45,769 --> 01:18:50,603
I said let her go. Alright boys,
we'll handle this.

974
01:18:50,816 --> 01:18:53,419
Sit down Carlotta.

975
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:58,265
Whatever happened to your friend,
what was his name, Mr Jackson?

976
01:18:58,266 --> 01:19:02,871
That fool, that imbecile, he never
knew when to keep his mouth shut.

977
01:19:02,872 --> 01:19:07,577
You were too smart for him.
Now I'm alone and...

978
01:19:07,599 --> 01:19:10,553
too weak to fight any longer.

979
01:19:11,123 --> 01:19:14,126
There's really nothing
to fight about honey.

980
01:19:14,127 --> 01:19:16,398
Here, I'll show you what I mean.

981
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:20,202
Carlotta, I once made you a mighty
generous offer concerning this.

982
01:19:21,217 --> 01:19:24,604
Yeah, the map?

983
01:19:24,626 --> 01:19:26,483
Yes, the map.

984
01:19:26,484 --> 01:19:28,869
Now I'm repeating that offer.

985
01:19:28,887 --> 01:19:32,115
There seems to be something missing here.
The code.

986
01:19:32,132 --> 01:19:37,438
You get me the code to the uranium deposits
in San Dimas and I'll let you both go.

987
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:40,442
You mean... my uncle and me?
Yes.

988
01:19:40,443 --> 01:19:44,275
I see.
Otherwise?

989
01:19:44,368 --> 01:19:47,403
Well, you know what we did to Mr Collins.

990
01:19:47,492 --> 01:19:50,616
What do you mean we? I did.

991
01:19:50,617 --> 01:19:54,140
Always belittling me.
When I do a job I do it.

992
01:19:54,141 --> 01:19:58,386
I don't think we ought to waste
time arguing between ourselves, Kismet.

993
01:19:58,387 --> 01:20:00,259
All right.

994
01:20:00,310 --> 01:20:05,335
Well I... I'll get to think it over for
a minute it's a very big decision.

995
01:20:05,357 --> 01:20:08,760
I don't like to be kept waiting girl.
No we don't.

996
01:20:08,761 --> 01:20:10,588
Did you hear me Carlotta?

997
01:20:14,168 --> 01:20:17,612
Did you really kill Mr Collins?
Who do you think did it?

998
01:20:17,613 --> 01:20:20,776
That baby photographer?
That phoney detective?

999
01:20:20,777 --> 01:20:26,784
How do you like that? Such a neat job, an
artistic job and... she thinks an amateur did it.

1000
01:20:26,906 --> 01:20:30,550
Yes, stop taking bows.
I'm not taking any bows.

1001
01:20:30,551 --> 01:20:32,457
I'm still waiting, Carlotta.

1002
01:20:33,515 --> 01:20:35,387
Did you hear me?

1003
01:20:36,479 --> 01:20:40,323
Kismet, I can't believe that
you killed Mr Collins.

1004
01:20:40,324 --> 01:20:45,329
But I did, I killed him!
How often do I have to say it!

1005
01:20:45,330 --> 01:20:48,319
That does it, stick them up.

1006
01:20:51,218 --> 01:20:53,781
Easy Cuddles, one move
and you're a dead midget.

1007
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:57,666
Didn't recognize me, huh? Give
me that map, come here baby.

1008
01:20:57,667 --> 01:21:01,672
You're liable to be in the crossfire.
Now get your friends in here.

1009
01:21:01,673 --> 01:21:05,316
Hurry up or I'll fill you so full of holes
you'll look like a fat clarinette.

1010
01:21:05,317 --> 01:21:07,920
Come on get them in here.
Get back there.

1011
01:21:07,921 --> 01:21:13,678
Make it snappy. Nice work baby.
Alright boys, you can come in now.

1012
01:21:15,932 --> 01:21:18,975
Hurry up. Come on.
Easy does it fellows.

1013
01:21:18,976 --> 01:21:21,819
I've got a bullet in here for each of you.
And one left over

1014
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:23,381
in case I can still hear breathing.

1015
01:21:23,382 --> 01:21:28,388
You know those dicks downstairs, tell them
I'm giving a little party in 14C. Hurry.

1016
01:21:28,389 --> 01:21:32,553
Will you be all right?
All right? This is my type of work.

1017
01:21:32,554 --> 01:21:35,758
Line up against the wall.
Hurry up, I got you covered.

1018
01:21:35,759 --> 01:21:37,825
Back up all of you.

1019
01:21:39,697 --> 01:21:41,847
I said back up!

1020
01:21:43,609 --> 01:21:45,960
Okay, then I'll back up.

1021
01:21:46,173 --> 01:21:50,802
Come on fellows, be sensible.
The least you can do is put your hands up.

1022
01:21:53,102 --> 01:21:55,133
Why didn't I think of that before?

1023
01:21:56,627 --> 01:21:59,389
See this record? It's a little swing number.

1024
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:01,672
And you guys are going
to do the swinging.

1025
01:22:01,673 --> 01:22:04,596
Willie.
What about Willie?

1026
01:22:04,597 --> 01:22:08,463
Give it to me Chummy.
Walnuts? I don't want to hurt you.

1027
01:22:10,165 --> 01:22:13,712
Why you coward? Using you feet, huh?

1028
01:22:14,571 --> 01:22:17,294
Sorry.
Get after him. Get that record.

1029
01:22:17,295 --> 01:22:20,363
Get after him.
Get that record.

1030
01:22:20,819 --> 01:22:26,087
Look. You come one step closer and I'll
break this record into a thousand pieces.

1031
01:22:26,587 --> 01:22:28,589
Wait a minute, who's side am I on?

1032
01:22:28,590 --> 01:22:32,394
Please fellows, I can't go any higher...
the ceiling. I'll blow my top.

1033
01:22:32,395 --> 01:22:33,836
Get him down and get the record.

1034
01:22:33,837 --> 01:22:37,111
No reachy nuts.
Give it to me Chummy.

1035
01:22:40,005 --> 01:22:41,887
Ray Milland's been here.

1036
01:22:41,888 --> 01:22:44,717
Give it to me.
I hate to do this Willie.

1037
01:22:49,858 --> 01:22:51,686
What's going on in here?

1038
01:22:51,861 --> 01:22:56,186
I'm Lieutenant Hennessey.
Oh, Lieutenant! Boy... am I glad to see you.

1039
01:22:56,187 --> 01:22:59,574
Arrest that man he's a crook and
a murderer, they're all murderers.

1040
01:23:00,553 --> 01:23:02,154
Are you all right?
Yeah, thanks.

1041
01:23:02,155 --> 01:23:04,197
You got here just in time.
What is this?

1042
01:23:04,198 --> 01:23:06,629
Well the young fellow is
a little mixed up officer.

1043
01:23:06,761 --> 01:23:09,764
I want you all to meet Ronnie Jackson,
who's wanted by the State of California

1044
01:23:09,765 --> 01:23:11,767
for the murder of one James Collins.

1045
01:23:11,768 --> 01:23:15,452
Just a minute, you listen to that record
and you'll see who killed James Collins.

1046
01:23:15,453 --> 01:23:19,778
Get the record and we'll play...
Lock the door!

1047
01:23:19,779 --> 01:23:21,679
Come, watch, listen to this, come here.

1048
01:23:21,701 --> 01:23:23,414
Stay here Jim.
Yes sir.

1049
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:28,830
And that's not all I'll show you.
I'll fix these characters.

1050
01:23:28,831 --> 01:23:31,554
The man's plumb crazy.
Wait'll you hear this, I'll send all these guys

1051
01:23:31,555 --> 01:23:33,076
to the cooler.
That's right Ronnie.

1052
01:23:33,077 --> 01:23:36,520
You may be having a detective's convention,
but I've been doing a little sleuthing myself...

1053
01:23:36,521 --> 01:23:39,183
in a modern way with a recording machine.
Need any help?

1054
01:23:39,205 --> 01:23:42,248
Give me that record. Back away gremlin.
All right.

1055
01:23:42,249 --> 01:23:45,613
Gentlemen the record you're about to
hear not only clears me of a murder charge

1056
01:23:45,614 --> 01:23:48,296
but also exposes a tremendous
international conspiracy.

1057
01:23:48,297 --> 01:23:53,451
A conspiracy, gentlemen,  which seeks
to destroy civilization. Listen.

1058
01:24:01,555 --> 01:24:04,118
This isn't the record!
I've been framed.

1059
01:24:04,119 --> 01:24:05,760
They switched the records on me.

1060
01:24:05,761 --> 01:24:09,325
Wait a minute!
Before you take him away

1061
01:24:09,326 --> 01:24:13,010
in that pocket he has something
that belongs to me.

1062
01:24:13,011 --> 01:24:15,934
Give me that map,
it's not his it's Baron Montay's.

1063
01:24:15,935 --> 01:24:18,365
Ask her, ask Carlotta.
Carlotta?

1064
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:29,663
Let's go killer.

1065
01:24:36,042 --> 01:24:39,165
Well, that's about it.
You know the rest.

1066
01:24:39,166 --> 01:24:42,953
Quick trial, Carlotta never showing up.

1067
01:24:43,572 --> 01:24:46,880
Nice deal, women.

1068
01:24:48,599 --> 01:24:51,101
Hey! That reminds me.
Yeah, we're late.

1069
01:24:51,102 --> 01:24:54,100
You're late, in about 5 minutes
I'll be the late Ronnie Jackson.

1070
01:24:54,106 --> 01:24:56,508
Come on.
We got tickets for this thing.

1071
01:24:56,509 --> 01:24:59,384
Well fine. Remember I'm doing
this without a rehearsal.

1072
01:25:01,816 --> 01:25:05,601
That too tight? Can you breathe?
What's the difference?

1073
01:25:05,602 --> 01:25:08,889
What is this thing doc?
That is a stethoscope.

1074
01:25:08,911 --> 01:25:10,147
Stethoscope?

1075
01:25:10,648 --> 01:25:12,315
Still beating!

1076
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:17,638
Well hello Warden.
Any news from the Governor?

1077
01:25:18,499 --> 01:25:20,041
Open up.

1078
01:25:22,625 --> 01:25:24,405
Come here son.

1079
01:25:24,427 --> 01:25:26,619
You and I are going
to take a little walk.

1080
01:25:29,033 --> 01:25:32,547
Steady Jackson, you can take it.

1081
01:25:35,121 --> 01:25:37,074
Get some water.

1082
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:44,240
Now I lay me down to sleep...

1083
01:25:46,056 --> 01:25:48,407
Oh, they got you too?

1084
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:51,531
You look alive.
Yes.

1085
01:25:51,584 --> 01:25:54,494
Where are we?
Look.

1086
01:25:54,628 --> 01:25:59,073
Carlotta... You double crosser. Why didn't you
come to my trial, where have you been?

1087
01:25:59,074 --> 01:26:03,304
Ronnie, you're free.
I'm free?

1088
01:26:05,723 --> 01:26:10,107
Yeah, but how? Who did it?
You did, with your own little keyhole camera.

1089
01:26:10,129 --> 01:26:14,032
Look... Sam got this from Mrs Fong and
he claims the rest was just routine.

1090
01:26:14,054 --> 01:26:17,618
My keyhole shot of the phoney baron,
so you're the McCoy!

1091
01:26:17,619 --> 01:26:20,481
Young man, I want to thank
you for saving my life.

1092
01:26:20,503 --> 01:26:24,427
It was nothing. And I did it.
I knew I had it in me.

1093
01:26:24,428 --> 01:26:27,831
Hey! Maybe I was supposed
to be a detective, huh?

1094
01:26:27,832 --> 01:26:30,891
Yeah, that's it, Ronnie Jackson
the private eye.

1095
01:26:30,914 --> 01:26:33,161
No Ronnie,
I think you better stick

1096
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:34,681
to taking baby pictures.

1097
01:26:34,682 --> 01:26:38,229
Oh! I forgot to tell the
executioner it's all off.

1098
01:26:38,287 --> 01:26:40,991
Harry, it's all off.

1099
01:26:41,130 --> 01:26:43,356
Off?

1100
01:26:54,508 --> 01:26:57,575
Well he'll take any kind of a part.
