1
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:09,123
(marching music)

2
00:00:15,964 --> 00:00:18,881
(triumphant music)

3
00:01:18,916 --> 00:01:21,916
(slow drum beating)

4
00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,890
(slow paced music)

5
00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:38,811
- [Officer] Tanaka.

6
00:02:38,811 --> 00:02:39,644
- [Soldier] Ho!

7
00:02:39,644 --> 00:02:40,477
- Iuanaga.
- Here.

8
00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:41,310
- Fugimoto.
- Yo!

9
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,143
- Mishi.
- Here!

10
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:43,010
- Uanaga!
- Here.

11
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,180
- Ataya!
- Yo!

12
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,193
- Sashi!
- Here!

13
00:02:45,193 --> 00:02:46,026
- Olihamo!
- Yo!

14
00:02:46,026 --> 00:02:47,467
- Komoto!
- Here!

15
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:51,300
(singing in foreign language)

16
00:02:58,418 --> 00:02:59,251
- Kanakas.

17
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:00,393
The ones from Hawaii.

18
00:03:00,393 --> 00:03:02,034
You know what they call us Mainlanders?

19
00:03:02,034 --> 00:03:03,250
Kotonks.

20
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,653
The way they tell it,
if you rap on our heads,

21
00:03:04,653 --> 00:03:06,720
it's like hitting a coconut.

22
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,037
Hollow heads, you know.

23
00:03:08,037 --> 00:03:09,954
Kotonk, kotonk, kotonk.

24
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,743
- [Grayson] Look where
you're going, will ya?

25
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,920
- 90 day wonder.

26
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,070
Still got the original
shine on those bars.

27
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,130
- Lieutenant Grayson to see the adjutant.

28
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:47,963
- He's not in, sir.

29
00:03:47,963 --> 00:03:49,938
The colonel said he'd see you himself.

30
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,938
- Thank you.

31
00:04:00,887 --> 00:04:03,200
- You can go right in, sir.

32
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,033
- Thank you.

33
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,080
Lieutenant Grayson reports for duty, sir.

34
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,913
- [Colonel] At ease, lieutenant.

35
00:04:11,913 --> 00:04:12,810
Welcome to Camp Shelby.

36
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,900
- Thank you, sir.

37
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,440
- This your first assignment since

38
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,650
receiving your commission?

39
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:18,810
- Yes, sir.

40
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:21,080
- Well, lieutenant, it's a rough one.

41
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,130
The platoon you're taking over

42
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,520
is just ready to start training,

43
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,610
and as you may have noticed,

44
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,410
our facilities are not
all that they might be.

45
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,300
We're short of officers,
short of equipment,

46
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,000
short of everything except trainees,

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,150
and they're coming in by the carload.

48
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,120
This is a brand-new outfit.

49
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,040
A new kind of outfit.

50
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,650
No precedent for it except one battalion

51
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,930
that was activated in Hawaii

52
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,170
and they haven't been tested yet.

53
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,537
What do you think of the idea, lieutenant?

54
00:04:43,537 --> 00:04:45,920
- Well, sir, I'd like to make a request.

55
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,037
- [Colonel] What is it?

56
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,440
- I'd like your permission, sir,

57
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,390
to put in for a transfer
to the 36th Division.

58
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,928
You see, sir, I'm from Texas--

59
00:04:52,928 --> 00:04:55,370
- What has that got to do with it?

60
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,210
- Nothing, sir, except that the 36th

61
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:59,370
is an old Texas National Guard outfit,

62
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,640
and I've been in it ever
since I got in the Army.

63
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,160
That is, until they sent me to OCS.

64
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,820
I never would have gone if I'd thought.

65
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,250
Sir, I just took it for granted

66
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,460
that I'd go back to the 36th.

67
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,790
- You're sure that's the only reason

68
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,800
you have for wanting a transfer?

69
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,190
- [Grayson] Yes, sir.

70
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,790
- No objection to working with the kind

71
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,440
of troops we have here?

72
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,720
- Because they're Japs?

73
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,553
Oh, no, sir.

74
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:21,740
Nothing like that at all.

75
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,633
- Now, let's get a couple of
things straight, lieutenant.

76
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,270
First, there's not gonna be any transfer.

77
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,103
You're staying here.

78
00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:29,489
Have you got that?

79
00:05:29,489 --> 00:05:30,840
- [Grayson] Yes, sir.

80
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,420
- Second, they're not Japs.

81
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,620
They're Japanese Americans.

82
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,343
Nisei or, as they call
themselves, buddhaheads.

83
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,650
All kinds of buddhaheads, lieutenant.

84
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,010
From Hawaii, Alaska, California,

85
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,020
New York, Colorado.

86
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,290
Yes, and even some from Texas.

87
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,730
They're all American citizens,
and they're all volunteers.

88
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,160
Remember that.

89
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,530
And another thing.

90
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,130
We officers are referred
to as haoles not white men.

91
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,740
Any questions?

92
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:57,320
- No, sir.

93
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,602
- Report to your company commander.

94
00:05:59,602 --> 00:06:01,620
The sergeant major will show
you to his orderly room.

95
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,467
That'll be all, lieutenant.

96
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:12,582
(singing in foreign language)

97
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,980
- Sorry to keep you waiting, lieutenant.

98
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,930
- Oh, Captain Solari.

99
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,803
- That's right.

100
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,407
That's our regimental slogan.

101
00:06:29,407 --> 00:06:30,590
- "Go for broke"?

102
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,280
- It's Pidgin English for shoot the works.

103
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,402
Pull up a chair, lieutenant.

104
00:06:34,402 --> 00:06:35,235
- Nice.

105
00:06:35,235 --> 00:06:36,847
- I'll be with you in a minute.

106
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,410
- Tell me, sir,

107
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,710
do you use live ammunition
in the rifle range?

108
00:06:46,074 --> 00:06:48,010
- A Jap's a Jap, eh?

109
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,100
- All I know is they were
put under armed guard

110
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,100
in relocation centers last year.

111
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,280
Maybe the Army just had
some surplus barbed wire

112
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,160
they wanted to use up, was that it?

113
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,640
- The Army was facing an emergency

114
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,890
at the start of the war.

115
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,770
A possible invasion by Japanese troops.

116
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,080
So all Japanese Americans were evacuated

117
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,410
from the West Coast.

118
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:09,740
There was no loyalty check,
no screening, nothing.

119
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,010
If there were any spies among them,

120
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,430
I can assure you they're not in the 442.

121
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,490
Every man in this outfit
has been investigated,

122
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,823
reinvestigated, and re-reinvestigated.

123
00:07:19,193 --> 00:07:21,720
Now, I suggest you start
getting acquainted.

124
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,850
Your platoon sergeant's
over in the supply room.

125
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,913
Ohhara.

126
00:07:24,913 --> 00:07:26,490
- Ohhara!

127
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,323
- That's right.

128
00:07:27,323 --> 00:07:28,156
Takashi Ohhara.

129
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,657
- Hey, wait a minute.

130
00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:46,228
Come back here.

131
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,626
How long you been in the Army, soldier?

132
00:07:50,626 --> 00:07:52,280
- Let me see now.

133
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,230
Maybe I been inside, two, three months.

134
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,149
How long you been inside, lieutenant?

135
00:07:58,149 --> 00:07:59,360
- Don't you know you're
supposed to hold your salute

136
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,135
till an officer returns it?

137
00:08:01,135 --> 00:08:02,107
- Oh, sure.

138
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,581
Sometime forget.

139
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:06,720
- [Grayson] "Sometime forget"
to say sir, too, don't ya?

140
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,860
- Sometime.

141
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,070
- [Grayson] Well, don't forget it anymore.

142
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,903
- No, sir.

143
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,070
- That's your own uniform?

144
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,520
- [Tommy] Sir, that's
the smallest size he got,

145
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,260
the supply sergeant, Sir.

146
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,860
- Well, roll those sleeves down.

147
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,773
- I hold salute, sir.

148
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,710
- Why are you wearing leggings

149
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,780
with a class A uniform?

150
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,600
- To keep my pants up, sir.

151
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,163
Long like that.

152
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,140
- Well, get 'em cut down.

153
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,680
- Oh, yes, sir.

154
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,780
Payday I'll go see the tailor, sir.

155
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,110
- You'd better see somebody today

156
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,583
before I see you again.

157
00:08:45,153 --> 00:08:47,880
(singing in foreign language)

158
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,713
- [Man] All right, men.

159
00:08:48,713 --> 00:08:51,263
All I wanna see is backbones and elbows.

160
00:08:57,809 --> 00:08:58,642
- Come on.

161
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:00,520
And he made it.

162
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,420
Little Phoebe.

163
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:02,470
Pretty little Phoebe.

164
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,620
Watch that stuff, huh?

165
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,970
Get your money down, suckers.

166
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:07,900
It all rides.

167
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,733
Go for broke.

168
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:10,160
- Gee, break 'em up, break 'em up!

169
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,720
New lieutenant outside.

170
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,043
Must be the one for us.

171
00:09:13,043 --> 00:09:14,350
Oh, boy.

172
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,112
Eight feet tall and mean like anything.

173
00:09:18,112 --> 00:09:19,920
Number-one manini kind.

174
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,670
Chicken.

175
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,010
- Well, the honeymoon's over.

176
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,492
- Mix me up.

177
00:09:25,492 --> 00:09:26,325
All Nisei outfit.

178
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:27,580
How come haole officers?

179
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,710
- That's just to make us
a little more miserable.

180
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,450
First, they pick out the crummiest camp

181
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:32,660
in the United States.

182
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,810
- Why'd you ever enlist?

183
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,130
That's what I wanna know.

184
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:35,963
- Why?

185
00:09:35,963 --> 00:09:38,200
Because a wise guy college man like you

186
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,470
snowed me under with a lot of fancy talk.

187
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,420
You guys from relocation centers.

188
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,970
Okay, you probably got it better here.

189
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,660
But me, I was on the outside.

190
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,750
Iowa.

191
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,049
A free man knocking off 500 bucks a month.

192
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,520
- 500 bucks?

193
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,773
No.

194
00:09:54,773 --> 00:09:56,470
- 500 buck, yeah.

195
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,530
Chick sexing.

196
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,980
I can look at a day-old chick

197
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,664
and tell you if it's a he or a she.

198
00:10:00,664 --> 00:10:01,497
(man laughing)

199
00:10:01,497 --> 00:10:03,980
- Now, who'd want to know
that except another chick?

200
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,210
- You pay for the poultry feed

201
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,330
and you'd wanna know.

202
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,770
A he ain't no good at
all when it grows up.

203
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,290
Only the shes.

204
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,130
- How come chicken farmers
no can find out themselves?

205
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,550
Too bashful?

206
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,320
- You funny man.

207
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,820
Chick sexing is a science.

208
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,130
It was developed in Japan,

209
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:22,180
and it's one field where
buddhahead gets a break.

210
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,830
Mean to say ya never heard of it?

211
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,740
- I just got as far as
the birds and the bees.

212
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,847
- These college guys are
sharp, you know that?

213
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:31,680
(cat meowing)

214
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,260
Four years at USC and he's a bonafide,

215
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,620
recognized fruit peddler.

216
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,510
Yes, sir.

217
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,853
A fruit peddler with
an architect's degree.

218
00:10:39,853 --> 00:10:41,200
- I could have got a job as

219
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,650
an architect if I kept trying.

220
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,800
- Well, why didn't you?

221
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:46,880
- It's just my eyes.

222
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,520
Couldn't handle all that close work.

223
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,427
- Yeah, eye trouble, that's what it was.

224
00:10:51,427 --> 00:10:53,310
All you need is corrective glasses

225
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,730
to take the slant out of your eyes.

226
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,352
- Ah, chick, chick, chick, chick, chick,

227
00:10:56,352 --> 00:10:57,916
chick, chick, chick, chick, chick.

228
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:58,749
- Hey, kotonk.

229
00:10:58,749 --> 00:10:59,780
Take it easy, huh?

230
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,613
Huh, Chick?

231
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,150
- Come on, get it down.

232
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:05,280
Buck and a half.

233
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,113
One more, one more.

234
00:11:06,113 --> 00:11:07,030
- Boy, oh, boy!

235
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,750
You one lucky kotonk.

236
00:11:09,606 --> 00:11:11,050
Wish I got packages like that.

237
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,003
- You and me both.

238
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,930
- You send package?

239
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,733
- Yeah, hand me those cans, will you?

240
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,703
- Where you gonna send?

241
00:11:18,703 --> 00:11:20,800
Brother in the Army in Pacific?

242
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,633
- Uh-uh.

243
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:23,967
Family in a relocation camp in Arizona.

244
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:26,040
Arizona, U.S.A.

245
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,433
You think that chow here is bad, brother.

246
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,853
- You can even get soap?

247
00:11:30,853 --> 00:11:31,686
- Oh, sure.

248
00:11:31,686 --> 00:11:33,070
They've got a canteen loaded with stuff.

249
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:33,940
Anything you want,

250
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,420
if you can get there
before they're sold out.

251
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,943
Yes, sir, all the comforts of home.

252
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,910
And only one block from the barracks

253
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,928
to the toilets and showers.

254
00:11:42,928 --> 00:11:43,761
- Barracks?

255
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,100
Everybody all thrown together?

256
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,060
- Got partitions.

257
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,120
Separate room for each family.

258
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,953
My folks are lucky.

259
00:11:50,953 --> 00:11:52,490
Only five of them since I left.

260
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,830
- Treat you like that,

261
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:58,990
hard to figure why a guy
volunteer for the Army.

262
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,000
- We have to do something,

263
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,040
so we never get a deal like that again.

264
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,390
- We show 'em.

265
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:06,790
We show 'em us buddhaheads
good soldiers, good Americans.

266
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,140
- That's the idea.

267
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,238
I hope it works.

268
00:12:09,238 --> 00:12:10,880
- Sure it works.

269
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,710
Already a lot of stuff in
newspapers about the 442.

270
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:16,443
- Yeah, all we need now is casualty lists.

271
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:23,850
- [Tommy] Gee, that's a pretty girl.

272
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:24,683
What her name?

273
00:12:24,683 --> 00:12:25,516
- Terry.

274
00:12:25,516 --> 00:12:26,349
- Terry.

275
00:12:26,349 --> 00:12:27,840
Nice name.

276
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,673
Your wife?

277
00:12:28,673 --> 00:12:30,010
- Not yet.

278
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,277
- [Tommy] Why you wait?

279
00:12:31,277 --> 00:12:34,750
- This is a great time to be
starting a family, isn't it?

280
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,330
- [Tommy] You kotonks, funny guys.

281
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,393
Boy, if I had a girl like that,

282
00:12:39,393 --> 00:12:40,920
they gotta draft me.

283
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,560
No volunteer.

284
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,343
No, sir, draft me and drag me away.

285
00:12:45,343 --> 00:12:46,820
- Once more, once more.

286
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,830
Go for broke!

287
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,586
Once more, that's all I ask.

288
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:50,958
That's all!

289
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:51,791
Seven!

290
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,276
- Let me see those dice!

291
00:12:53,276 --> 00:12:54,276
- Attention!

292
00:13:12,122 --> 00:13:14,455
(cat meows)

293
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,320
- At ease.

294
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,670
- Men, this is Lieutenant
Grayson, our platoon leader.

295
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,720
- Pick up that money.

296
00:13:25,648 --> 00:13:26,610
Pick it up.

297
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:27,443
- Yes, sir.

298
00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:29,290
- Donation for the company fund, sergeant.

299
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,640
Give it to Sergeant Ohhara.

300
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,480
- [Chick] Can he do that?

301
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,520
It's my money.

302
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,130
- I want that man's name, sergeant.

303
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,840
There's no talking after
the command at ease.

304
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,673
- Yes, sir.

305
00:13:39,673 --> 00:13:40,780
- This man, no dog tags,

306
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,360
needs haircut, window unwashed,

307
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,750
uniforms hanging wrong way.

308
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,300
Haircut, shave, bunk
out of line, dog tags,

309
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,990
window, beer can on shelf,

310
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,250
dirty floor, dirty boots,

311
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,311
haircut, window,

312
00:13:50,311 --> 00:13:52,750
bowl of milk on floor.

313
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,440
Bowl stolen from mess hall.

314
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,580
Brought cat into barracks.

315
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,540
Floor, boots, dog tag, haircut.

316
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,020
Dust on rafters, window,

317
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,740
haircut, dog tags, boots,

318
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,690
bunk out of line,

319
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,153
litter on floor, boots.

320
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,060
Forget the book, sergeant.

321
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,090
They're all on the list.

322
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,680
You men will fall out for a speed hike

323
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,100
at eight o'clock tonight.

324
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,470
Before that I want this hutment GI'd.

325
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,670
Get them started on it
right away, sergeant.

326
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,190
Floors scrubbed, rafters dusted,

327
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,240
windows washed, boots shined, bunks made.

328
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,070
I want those blankets stretched so tight

329
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,530
that when you drop a quarter
on them it'll bounce.

330
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,120
I'll be back twice a day from now on

331
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,220
with a pair of white gloves and a quarter.

332
00:14:32,154 --> 00:14:34,571
(door slams)

333
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:38,960
- You're a chicken expert.

334
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,803
What do you make of him?

335
00:14:40,803 --> 00:14:43,470

353
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:26,180
I don't speak Japanese.

354
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,410
- Boots, dog tag, window,

355
00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,373
dust on rafters, floor, boots.

356
00:15:37,582 --> 00:15:40,415

All right, up and over!

364
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:16,760
Go back and try it again!

365
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,203
I'm gonna wait right here
till everybody makes it.

366
00:16:57,313 --> 00:16:59,708

you guys, beat it, quick!

367
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,208
(perky music)

368
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,850
- In combat, anything goes.

369
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,320
That's why we teach you dirty tactics.

370
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,210
I will now demonstrate
a grip against which

371
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,123
there is absolutely no defense.

372
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,173
The sergeant will now try to get free.

373
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,490
Well, sergeant?

374
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:23,790
- You want me to try, sir?

375
00:17:24,642 --> 00:17:26,556
- Of course I want you to try.

376
00:17:26,556 --> 00:17:27,973
- Very well, sir.

377
00:17:45,501 --> 00:17:48,281
(triumphant music)

378
00:17:48,281 --> 00:17:49,364
- Eyes right!

379
00:17:51,943 --> 00:17:52,860
Eyes front!

380
00:17:55,354 --> 00:17:56,271
Eyes right!

381
00:17:58,858 --> 00:17:59,775
Eyes front!

382
00:18:04,546 --> 00:18:05,463
Eyes right!

383
00:18:13,707 --> 00:18:14,624
Eyes front!

384
00:18:26,516 --> 00:18:27,433
Eyes right!

385
00:18:31,904 --> 00:18:32,821
Eyes front!

386
00:18:39,979 --> 00:18:40,896
Eyes right!

387
00:18:44,673 --> 00:18:46,610
- That was the kiss of death, brother,

388
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,490
the kiss of death.

389
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:51,490
- Yeah, the big brass figures were ripe.

390
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,360
I can smell that salt air already.

391
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,210
- Take another sniff, will ya,

392
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,150
and see if it's the Pacific.

393
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,247
- Yeah, that's what I'm sweating out.

394
00:18:59,247 --> 00:19:00,343
- You and me both.

395
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:06,080
- Nobody wanna go Pacific but me.

396
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,720
Well, I keep trying.

397
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,470
Every time they ask for volunteers--

398
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,880
- Tommy, you have to
speak perfect Japanese.

399
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,200
It's for combat
intelligence, interpreters.

400
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,827
They don't want buddhahead
riflemen in the Pacific.

401
00:19:16,827 --> 00:19:17,670
- Why?

402
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,210
- Look, Tommy, a million
guys fighting an enemy

403
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,610
that looks like us.

404
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,820
What if a GI sniper spots you or me?

405
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,930
- He see uniform.

406
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,930
- Yeah, and probably figure we're spies.

407
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,393
- Sam, I tell you something.

408
00:19:31,427 --> 00:19:33,040
I don't like talk about it,

409
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,190
but I'm gonna tell you.

410
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,810
Pearl Harbor day the planes they come.

411
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,640
You can only read it.

412
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,493
I can see it.

413
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,650
Pretty soon, I go volunteer
for the 100th Battalion.

414
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:45,483
Too young.

415
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,143
By the 442 come up, I volunteer again.

416
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,153
Too small.

417
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,640
Next time, I stand on
my toes a little bit.

418
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,683
Okay, I'm in.

419
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:58,350
They send us Europe.

420
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,573
Sure, I go and fight.

421
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,750
More better do I fight

422
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,000
the ones who bomb the islands.

423
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,190
- It's the same enemy, Tommy.

424
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,233
- Maybe for you.

425
00:20:06,695 --> 00:20:10,163
Pearl Harbor day, two people
visit friends near Honolulu.

426
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,263
They both been killed.

427
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:17,893
My mother, Sam.

428
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,498
My father.

429
00:20:20,498 --> 00:20:22,056
- [Man] Mail call!

430
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:23,584
(men chattering)

431
00:20:23,584 --> 00:20:24,532
Guchizaki.

432
00:20:24,532 --> 00:20:25,970
- Right here, right here!

433
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,385
- Hey, this is from my brother
in the 100th Battalion!

434
00:20:28,385 --> 00:20:30,468
- [Mail Clerk] Nawaguchi.

435
00:20:31,596 --> 00:20:33,710
- Mail call, Tommy.
- Come on, hurry up!

436
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,571
- [Tommy] You go.

437
00:20:34,571 --> 00:20:36,071
No mail for Tommy.

438
00:20:39,764 --> 00:20:42,681
(triumphant music)

439
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:15,033
- Come on, close it up, close it up.

440
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:18,735
- Here's the list, lieutenant.

441
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,404
- Thanks, captain.

442
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,210
Nagashook, Shooki.

443
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,043

444
00:21:23,043 --> 00:21:23,876

445
00:21:23,876 --> 00:21:25,209
- [Soldier] Leonard S.

446
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:27,364
- Uchigakiuchi.

447
00:21:27,364 --> 00:21:28,410
- Uchigakiuchi.

448
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,243
- [Soldier] Harry.

449
00:21:29,243 --> 00:21:30,076
- Ikagani.

450
00:21:30,076 --> 00:21:30,909
- [Soldier] Joseph T.

451
00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:31,904
- Kamakura.

452
00:21:31,904 --> 00:21:33,500
- [Soldier] Sam W.

453
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,417
- Toyotomi.

454
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:36,260
- Toyotomi.

455
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,255
- Tomatsu.

456
00:21:37,255 --> 00:21:38,620
- [Lieutenant] Guchizaki.

457
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,154
- Satoshi.

458
00:21:40,154 --> 00:21:41,575
- Shimabukarotenshugi.

459
00:21:41,575 --> 00:21:43,001
- Shima...

460
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,040
- Shimabukarotenshugi.

461
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,873
- Shima--

462
00:21:45,873 --> 00:21:47,130
- [Soldier] George W.

463
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:48,555
- Thanks.

464
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:49,388
Fugimoto.

465
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:50,303
- [Soldier] Thomas H.

466
00:21:53,162 --> 00:21:55,912
(metal clanking)

467
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,440
- Any scuttlebutt on where
this scow is taking us?

468
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,933
- I was just gonna ask you, lieutenant.

469
00:22:17,995 --> 00:22:22,995

470
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:29,613

Hey, Sam, how you know so sure

474
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,363
we're going to England?

475
00:22:38,363 --> 00:22:39,380
- Because that's where the line forms

476
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,387
for the invasion of France.

477
00:22:40,387 --> 00:22:42,040
And it's coming off any day now.

478
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,720
- That's us, shock troops.

479
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,140
Just in time.

480
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,020
They used up the 100th
Battalion at Cassino.

481
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,510
- But anyway, it won't be the Pacific.

482
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,343
- How do you know?

483
00:22:49,343 --> 00:22:51,536
You ever hear of the Panama Canal?

484
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:52,800
- Hey, Sam, what you think?

485
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,680
Maybe so, huh?

486
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,580
- Well, if it's the Pacific,

487
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,870
we've been sailing three
days in the wrong direction.

488
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:57,880
- The navigator don't know.

489
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,020
Nobody knows.

490
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,293
Drives you nuts.

491
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:06,723
- [Grayson] Oh, I'll get it.

492
00:23:06,723 --> 00:23:08,033
- Thank you, lieutenant.

493
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,580
(tense music)

494
00:23:31,212 --> 00:23:33,040
- [Grayson] For 20
years the Italian people

495
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:34,920
have been fed on bunk.

496
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,610
Their propagandists declared
that all of our people

497
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:40,030
look upon Italians with contempt,

498
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,310
regarding them as a race of hand organ men

499
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,990
and banana peddlers.

500
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,670
We know that such statements are lies.

501
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:48,160
Racial prejudice is abhorrent

502
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,636
to our American concept of democracy.

503
00:23:50,636 --> 00:23:53,719
(slow paced ukulele)

504
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:05,670
Naples with its old world
history, majestic Vesuvius,

505
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,570
the Castle of St. Elmo,

506
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,440
the famous churches,

507
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,840
the magnificent harbor,

508
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,440
second to none in all the world.

509
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,060
These and many other historic sights

510
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,960
are of interest to the soldier.

511
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,060
Take advantage of this opportunity.

512
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,990
See as much as you can.

513
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,960
You've got a great chance to do now,

514
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,960
major expenses paid, what would cost you

515
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,860
a lot of your own money after the war.

516
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:29,800
You'll want to poke around in quaint,

517
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,230
out-of-the way places

518
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,800
and the only way to do that is to walk.

519
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,930
Be sure to allow plenty of time in Naples

520
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:39,770
so you can take it all in
at a nice leisurely pace.

521
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,520
Start your promenade at the harbor.

522
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,684
The Italian practice is
to have a siesta hour

523
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:48,793
sometime between one and four
o'clock in the afternoon.

524
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,440
If this custom remains in vogue
during occupational period,

525
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,100
you'll save time and patience

526
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,883
by confining your shopping to other hours.

527
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:15,721
(people chattering)

528
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:21,633
- Mama, Mama, (speaking foreign language).

529
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,270
- Come on, come on, don't hog it all.

530
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:29,683
- Let's go!

531
00:25:29,683 --> 00:25:31,800
Off your seat and on your feet!

532
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,960
- [Grayson] Continuing our
tour of picturesque Italy,

533
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,700
we come to the Via Casilina,

534
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,293
which leads directly to Rome.

535
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,040
The districts around
Rome are full of places

536
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,520
of historical interests,

537
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,573
and transportation is excellent.

538
00:26:01,805 --> 00:26:02,638
- [Man] Take a break!

539
00:26:02,638 --> 00:26:03,471
- [Man] Take 10!

540
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:10,486
(vehicle approaching)

541
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:18,130
- Everybody rides but the buddhaheads.

542
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:21,963
(singing in foreign language)

543
00:26:22,939 --> 00:26:25,356
- That's the 100th Battalion!

544
00:26:29,265 --> 00:26:30,098
Masami!

545
00:26:30,098 --> 00:26:31,556
Hey, Masami!

546
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:33,755
- Hi, you paisan!

547
00:26:33,755 --> 00:26:34,588
- My brother.

548
00:26:34,588 --> 00:26:35,421
Him okay?

549
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:36,254
- Not even a scratch.

550
00:26:36,254 --> 00:26:37,970
He's a few trucks back!

551
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,003
Hey, haven't got an extra
top string, have you?

552
00:26:41,003 --> 00:26:42,120
- I don't think so.

553
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:42,953
Where you going?

554
00:26:42,953 --> 00:26:44,660
- Same place as you, paisan.

555
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,740
Haven't you heard?

556
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,180
We been attached to the 442.

557
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,670
One big, happy family!

558
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,820
- No kidding!

559
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:50,653
Ride on, boy.

560
00:26:50,653 --> 00:26:51,597
Here, top string!

561
00:26:53,491 --> 00:26:54,360
(speaking in foreign language)

562
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,353
- What was that?

563
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,850
- I said very sorry.

564
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,683
Sorry, sir.

565
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:07,840
(slow gentle music)

566
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,140
- [Grayson] Within easy reach of Rome,

567
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,460
are the medieval towns of Tuscany,

568
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,640
sleepy little villages,

569
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,637
scarcely touched by the
march of civilization.

570
00:27:15,637 --> 00:27:18,304
(bomb rumbling)

571
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,193
Take 10!

572
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:45,843
- Hello, Joe.

573
00:27:47,297 --> 00:27:50,964
(speaking foreign language)

574
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,733
- No, but I'd like to learn.

575
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,013
The door open?

576
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:09,560
The door, the door.

577
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,760
- It's open, lieutenant.

578
00:28:13,766 --> 00:28:17,433
(speaking foreign language)

579
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,200
- The lady is gonna mend this for me.

580
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,800
Call me when the word
comes down to move out.

581
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,842
- Yes, sir.

582
00:28:24,842 --> 00:28:28,950
♪ The eyes of Texas are upon you ♪

583
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:32,612
♪ All the livelong day-- ♪

584
00:28:32,612 --> 00:28:34,877
(window slams)

585
00:28:34,877 --> 00:28:36,430
- You know, I got a hunch we're

586
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:38,770
coming into a bottle of vino.

587
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,603
- Maybe.

588
00:28:39,603 --> 00:28:41,260
- Yeah, I just got a
feeling the lieutenant's

589
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:45,883
gonna take care of us.
(vehicle approaching)

590
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:04,108
(bombs exploding)

591
00:29:08,768 --> 00:29:10,935
(boy speaking foreign language)

592
00:29:10,935 --> 00:29:12,185
- Break's over!

593
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:14,240
- [Soldier] Let's go!

594
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,040
- [Soldier] All right, on your feet!

595
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:40,858
(canons firing)

596
00:29:44,122 --> 00:29:44,955
- Lieutenant Grayson.

597
00:29:44,955 --> 00:29:46,230
I forgot to tell him we're moving out.

598
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,424
- Holy mackerel.

599
00:29:47,424 --> 00:29:48,303
- What'll I do?

600
00:29:48,303 --> 00:29:50,303
- [Officer] Close it up!

601
00:29:51,938 --> 00:29:54,855
(slow paced music)

602
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:06,883

603
00:30:06,883 --> 00:30:10,550
(speaking foreign language)

604
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:46,390
- Come again, (speaking foreign language)

605
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,630
- Friend.

606
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:48,810
- No, I don't know him.

607
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,311
Your friend, huh?

608
00:30:50,311 --> 00:30:51,295
(speaking foreign language)

609
00:30:51,295 --> 00:30:52,269
Smith.

610
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:53,667
John Smith.

611
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:55,417
Capitano, John Smith.

612
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,280
- Glad to meet ya, sir.

613
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,947
(speaking foreign language)

614
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,380
Don't tell me where you got
that good-conduct ribbon.

615
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,097
Let me guess.

616
00:31:19,097 --> 00:31:20,380
(speaking foreign language)

617
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,526
How about some more vino, huh?

618
00:31:22,526 --> 00:31:23,440
(speaking foreign language)

619
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,273
Darling.

620
00:31:32,205 --> 00:31:33,830
(perky music)

621
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,663
- That's my old outfit!

622
00:31:34,663 --> 00:31:35,496
Where did you get this?

623
00:31:35,496 --> 00:31:36,390
Who gave it to you?

624
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:37,223
- John Smith.

625
00:31:37,223 --> 00:31:38,056
- John Smith, huh?

626
00:31:38,056 --> 00:31:38,889
Is he still around here?

627
00:31:38,889 --> 00:31:40,389
When did you see him last?

628
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:42,448
(speaking foreign language)

629
00:31:42,448 --> 00:31:44,440
I gotta find somebody
who can talk English.

630
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,453
I'll be right back!

631
00:31:50,423 --> 00:31:51,256
- Joe!

632
00:31:51,256 --> 00:31:52,089
Joe!

633
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,920
- [Soldier] Grayson.

634
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,860
Your platoon's dug in over there.

635
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,260
Come here a minute, will ya?

636
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,560
I've got a message for
ya from the colonel.

637
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,530
He was up here inspecting our positions.

638
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,430
- The colonel?

639
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,800
- That's right.

640
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,930
He said to tell you he
was particularly pleased

641
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,450
with the way your platoon was deployed.

642
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,550
- Thanks for covering up.

643
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,900
- [Man On Mound] And now I'm
supposed to say you're welcome

644
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,507
and that's that until the next time, huh?

645
00:32:23,507 --> 00:32:24,610
- There won't be any next time.

646
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,120
Don't worry about that.

647
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,570
- I'll tell ya when to leave.

648
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:29,590
You're such a stickler on

649
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,610
military courtesy for your men.

650
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:32,900
From now on, you and I are going

651
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,860
by the book, understand?

652
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,693
- Yes, sir.

653
00:32:35,693 --> 00:32:37,110
- I don't mind telling you, Grayson,

654
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,150
if there was any chance of
getting a replacement for you

655
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:41,440
I'd have had you court-martialed for this.

656
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,620
Ever since you joined the outfit,

657
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,590
you've been the one man in this

658
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,420
company who's been out of step!

659
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,930
You'd better pick it up, lieutenant,

660
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:48,018
and pick it up fast,

661
00:32:48,018 --> 00:32:49,840
or you're gonna find yourself volunteering

662
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,680
for every dirty detail that comes up!

663
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,220
Is that clear?

664
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,373
- Yes, sir.

665
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:55,633
- [Officer On Mound] That'll be all.

666
00:33:00,472 --> 00:33:04,691
♪ It wasn't the moon above ♪

667
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,499
- Did you do a good job, lieutenant?

668
00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:10,039
♪ That made me fall in love ♪

669
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:12,607

♪ Those beautiful eyes ♪

671
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,280
- Where's Kamakura?

672
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,113
- Sam?

673
00:33:22,113 --> 00:33:23,540
Out looking for water, lieutenant.

674
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,480
How do you like that?

675
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,100
Dying of thirst in the middle of a river.

676
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,740
- I wanna see him the minute he gets back.

677
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,573
- Yes, sir.

678
00:33:32,296 --> 00:33:35,046
(metal clanking)

679
00:33:42,827 --> 00:33:45,450
- [Masami] Hiya, paisan!

680
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:46,563
- Masami!

681
00:33:46,563 --> 00:33:47,396
Eddie!

682
00:33:47,396 --> 00:33:48,643
- Vino, fresh off the vine!

683
00:33:54,648 --> 00:33:55,481
Salute.

684
00:33:58,378 --> 00:33:59,774
- Good, eh, paisan?

685
00:33:59,774 --> 00:34:03,441
(speaking foreign language)

686
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,599
- Free sample.

687
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:06,884
- Thanks.

688

689
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:13,597
- Eddie!

690
00:34:13,597 --> 00:34:14,430
Eddie!

691
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,480
- You stay here, Tommy, watch us!

692
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,157
Come on, keep close to the wall!

693
00:34:18,157 --> 00:34:23,157
(guns firing)
(metal clanking)

694
00:34:27,029 --> 00:34:29,112
Stay here, one at a time.

695
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:51,341

(men screaming)
(bomb exploding)

699
00:36:24,489 --> 00:36:25,739
- Anybody home?

700
00:36:26,943 --> 00:36:27,803
Keep me covered.

701
00:36:53,349 --> 00:36:54,182
You okay, Masami?

702
00:36:54,182 --> 00:36:55,123
- Just a scratch.

703
00:37:02,469 --> 00:37:05,052
(pig snorting)

704
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,980
- Jerry intelligence officer.

705
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:10,330
They're great at disguises.

706
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:15,630
- Hiya, paisan.
(pig snorting)

707
00:37:22,959 --> 00:37:27,959
(bombs exploding)
(chandelier clanking)

708
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,400
- Shells would be coming in a lot closer

709
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,400
if those Jerries were still
in that observation post.

710
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,308
One of them was an officer you say?

711
00:37:40,308 --> 00:37:43,061
- Oh, yes, colonel, sir.

712
00:37:43,061 --> 00:37:45,370
- Well, you certainly earned that.

713
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,670
Take this over to S2, sergeant.

714
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,503
- Yes, sir.

715
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:52,330
- Too bad about that 100th Battalion man.

716
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:53,170
What'd they say at the aid station

717
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,390
about the other one who was wounded?

718
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:55,430
- Million-dollar wound, sir.

719
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,880
They're sending him back to Rome.

720
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,900
- Good.

721
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,830
Well, anytime you're in
the neighborhood, drop in.

722
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,663
- Thank you, sir.

723
00:38:00,663 --> 00:38:01,496
- I mean that.

724
00:38:01,496 --> 00:38:03,387
I wanna keep in close touch
with you men on the line.

725
00:38:03,387 --> 00:38:05,180
They been treatin' you all right?

726
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,040
- [Both] Yes, sir.

727
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,690
- You're sure now, no complaints?

728
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:11,783
- No, sir.

729
00:38:11,783 --> 00:38:12,763
- Well, good luck to you.

730
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,619
- Sir, could I have a word with you?

731
00:38:18,619 --> 00:38:19,710
- Well, of course.

732
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,770
At ease, lieutenant.

733
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:22,140
- You remember, sir,
that I told you I came

734
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,230
from the 36th Division?

735
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:25,580
- I remember it very well.

736
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,193
- Well, sir, I just
happened to hear that the

737
00:38:27,193 --> 00:38:28,820
36th is somewhere in this area.

738
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,690
- Was, lieutenant, they're
way up ahead of us now.

739
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:32,590
- Oh.

740
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:33,630
Oh, well, in that case, sir--

741
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,510
- Still like to get back
in the Texas Army, eh?

742
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,160
- Oh no sir, I was just hoping

743
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,560
I'd get a chance to visit them.

744
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,680
- Well, I'll do better than that.

745
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,010
If we ever meet up with the 36th,

746
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,190
I'll try and work out a transfer.

747
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,040
- Oh, thank you very much, sir.

748
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,460
- Not at all, it'll be a pleasure.

749
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,913
That'll be all, lieutenant.

750
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:51,746
(chandelier clanking)

751
00:38:54,634 --> 00:38:56,727
(pig snorting)

752
00:38:56,727 --> 00:38:58,424
- It's all right, paisan.

753
00:38:58,424 --> 00:39:01,174
Maybe he know we scared too, huh?

754
00:39:03,736 --> 00:39:04,740
- Gives a man a nice feeling

755
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,330
knowing you can always go to the old man

756
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:08,563
if you're not gettin' a
fair shake, huh, lieutenant?

757
00:39:09,548 --> 00:39:11,180
Sir, I feel bad about
forgettin' to call you

758
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,410
when we moved out of
that town this afternoon.

759
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:14,480
Look, you see the way it happened--

760
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,704
- Forget it, forget it.

761
00:39:15,704 --> 00:39:16,537
- I can't.

762
00:39:16,537 --> 00:39:17,370
It was all my fault.

763
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:19,010
And they might have had
you up for desertion.

764
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:20,360
But, it'll never get out.

765
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,400
The men'll keep it quiet.

766
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,498
I'll see to that, sir.

767
00:39:23,498 --> 00:39:25,627
- Thanks, thanks.

768
00:39:25,627 --> 00:39:28,460
(engine chugging)

769
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:42,311
(pig squealing)

770
00:39:44,979 --> 00:39:47,396
(gun firing)

771
00:39:54,327 --> 00:39:55,746
- Squad leaders, up front.

772
00:39:55,746 --> 00:39:57,545
- Squad leaders, up front.

773
00:39:57,545 --> 00:39:59,320
- Squad leaders, up front.
(guns firing)

774
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,620
- Squad leaders, up front.

775
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,880
- Squad leaders, up front.

776
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,180
- Squad leaders, up front.

777
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,540
- Are you from the 100th Battalion?

778
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,580
- Yeah.

779
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,849
- What happens when a man gets hit?

780
00:40:09,849 --> 00:40:12,830
(gun firing)
(soldier screaming)

781
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:14,073
- Sometimes they yell.

782
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,915
(gun firing)

783
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,343
Sometimes they don't.

784
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,670
Squad leaders don't last long.

785
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:25,503
- I mean the medics.

786
00:40:25,503 --> 00:40:26,336
How do they get to you?

787
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:27,169
Medics! Medics!

788
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:29,450
- Get on the other side of the road!

789
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,611
Hit it!
(guns firing)

790
00:40:31,611 --> 00:40:33,156
- Let's go, boy.

791
00:40:33,156 --> 00:40:34,336
(tense music)

792
00:40:34,336 --> 00:40:39,336
(guns firing)
(bombs exploding)

793
00:40:43,219 --> 00:40:44,953
- [Soldier] Squad leaders up front.

794
00:40:44,953 --> 00:40:46,074
- [Soldier] Squad leaders up front.

795
00:40:46,074 --> 00:40:47,011
- [Soldier] Squad leaders up front.

796
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:48,550
- Squad leaders up front.

797
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,404
- Squad leaders up front.

798
00:40:50,404 --> 00:40:51,682
- Squad leaders up front.

799
00:40:51,682 --> 00:40:52,683
- [Soldier] Squad leaders up front.

800
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:54,000
- [Soldier] Squad leaders up front.

801
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,255
- What are you waiting for, sergeant?

802
00:40:57,255 --> 00:41:02,255
- I forgot.
(tense music)

803
00:41:05,683 --> 00:41:08,183
(guns firing)

804
00:41:34,569 --> 00:41:36,481
(pig squealing)

805
00:41:36,481 --> 00:41:40,148
(speaking foreign language)

806
00:41:45,323 --> 00:41:47,093
(bomb exploding)

807
00:41:47,093 --> 00:41:50,010
(triumphant music)

808
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:19,820
- Hey, you'd better move, Sam.

809
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,870
Maybe he gonna shake.

810
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,642
- Have a good time, Frank.

811
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:25,570
- How can I miss?

812
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:28,570
Rome, the greatest
architecture in the world.

813
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:30,140
24-hour passes.

814
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,810
Big-hearted, ain't they?

815
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:34,390
- I'm gonna see a lot of
things in the next 24 hours

816
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,610
I've dreamed about all my life.

817
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:39,367
The Forum, Saint Peter's, the Pantheon--

818
00:42:39,367 --> 00:42:42,230
- Any other outfit, I bet
they get three-day passes.

819
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:44,915
Yeah, and not just one
man at a time, either.

820
00:42:44,915 --> 00:42:45,881
- Ah, chick, chick, chick,

821
00:42:45,881 --> 00:42:47,200
chick, chick, chick, chick.

822
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,033
- Relax.

823
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,250
That reminds me, Tommy,

824
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52,230
I hear we're having chicken for dinner.

825
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,063
- [Tommy] No joke?

826
00:42:53,063 --> 00:42:54,030
- Yeah, I was talking to one of the cooks.

827
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,060
Fried chicken.

828
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:56,326
- Good, boy.

829
00:42:56,326 --> 00:42:57,557
That's what I like best.

830
00:42:57,557 --> 00:42:58,460
- Not me.

831
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,060
You know what I like best?

832
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:02,730
Barbecued pork, yes, sir.

833
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:05,490
There's nothing like barbecued pork.

834
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:07,638
Especially the way I make it.

835
00:43:07,638 --> 00:43:10,138
(pig squeals)

836
00:43:15,463 --> 00:43:16,305
- Mail call!

837
00:43:16,305 --> 00:43:18,167
Jingu.
(men shouting)

838
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:19,260
Hitrai.

839
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,093
Gutsizaki.

840
00:43:20,093 --> 00:43:21,200
Mishima.

841
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,033
- [Soldier] Here! Here!

842
00:43:22,033 --> 00:43:27,033
- [Mail Clerk] Kawaquichi.

843
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:30,958
(pig squeals)

844
00:43:38,892 --> 00:43:40,220
(pig squeals)

845
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:43,887
(speaking foreign language)

846
00:43:54,789 --> 00:43:55,622
- You like-a vino, Joe?

847
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:58,451
- Ah, no, he no for sale.

848
00:43:58,451 --> 00:43:59,407
(speaking foreign language)

849
00:43:59,407 --> 00:44:00,510
- Three bottles, Joe.

850
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:01,745
- Not for nothin'.

851
00:44:01,745 --> 00:44:04,450
(speaking foreign language)

852
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:05,283
Waste time.

853
00:44:05,283 --> 00:44:06,314
Come on, paisan.

854
00:44:06,314 --> 00:44:09,173
(speaking foreign language)

855
00:44:09,173 --> 00:44:10,423
- Family, family.

856
00:44:11,266 --> 00:44:13,370
- Hungry, hungry.

857
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,292
- Okay, plenty meat on her.

858
00:44:15,292 --> 00:44:16,620
(speaking foreign language)

859
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,024
- No eat, no eat.

860
00:44:18,024 --> 00:44:19,332
- Oh, no, no.

861
00:44:19,332 --> 00:44:22,568
(speaking foreign language)

862
00:44:22,568 --> 00:44:25,818
(hums "Wedding March")

863
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,773
Papa, Mama.

864
00:44:28,623 --> 00:44:31,200
(speaking foreign language)

865
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,033
- Oh.

866
00:44:33,403 --> 00:44:36,561
Paisan, him kind of young for papa, no?

867
00:44:36,561 --> 00:44:39,832
(speaking foreign language)

868
00:44:39,832 --> 00:44:40,665
- We wait.

869
00:44:40,665 --> 00:44:41,513
(speaking foreign language)

870
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:42,411
Three months.

871
00:44:42,411 --> 00:44:46,078
(speaking foreign language)

872
00:44:46,983 --> 00:44:48,307
Nine bottles, 10!

873
00:44:48,307 --> 00:44:49,307
- No!

874
00:44:49,307 --> 00:44:50,224
- No, Papa.

875
00:44:54,009 --> 00:44:55,075
- Hey, Tommy!

876
00:44:55,075 --> 00:44:56,687
Look what I got.

877
00:44:56,687 --> 00:44:58,043
Cookies.

878
00:44:58,043 --> 00:44:58,876
Here, help yourself.

879
00:44:58,876 --> 00:45:00,414
Paisan too.

880
00:45:00,414 --> 00:45:02,700
- He no like cookies.

881
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,190
Maybe bambinos, eh?

882
00:45:04,190 --> 00:45:05,253
- Sure, go ahead.

883
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,250
- Who that from, Sam?

884
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,363
Your mother?

885
00:45:12,363 --> 00:45:13,200
- Terry.

886
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,580
Hey, remember that town we took?

887
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:15,413
Suvereto?

888
00:45:15,413 --> 00:45:17,280
It was on a news
broadcast, coast to coast,

889
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:18,760
and they mentioned the 442.

890
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,593
- No kidding?

891
00:45:19,593 --> 00:45:20,426
- I'm tellin' you.

892
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:22,150
And there've been newspaper
stories, lots of 'em.

893
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:23,890
The 100th is getting the
Presidential Citation

894
00:45:23,890 --> 00:45:26,815
from General Mark Clark,
Sassetta, Hill 140.

895
00:45:26,815 --> 00:45:27,950
- Hey.

896
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:28,783
Let me see that.

897
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,750
How you like that?

898
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:35,740
They gonna let your kid brother

899
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,300
leave relocation camp and work on a farm.

900
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,581
Next month he gonna pick
sugar beets in Idaho.

901
00:45:40,581 --> 00:45:41,510
- Well, what do ya know.

902
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:43,860
He's been trying to swing
that deal for months.

903
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:44,763
- Good boy.

904
00:45:46,003 --> 00:45:47,223
All okay, nobody sick.

905
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,670
Oh, oh, excuse, Sam.

906
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:53,230
- That's okay.

907
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:54,530
I'll read the rest to you.

908
00:45:56,887 --> 00:45:59,907
- "Honestly, Sam, you'd hardly
recognize the old homestead.

909
00:45:59,907 --> 00:46:02,957
"Maybe it looks the same, the
barracks, the barbed wire,

910
00:46:02,957 --> 00:46:05,837
"the MPs, but it isn't the same anymore.

911
00:46:05,837 --> 00:46:07,157
"Nothing's the same.

912
00:46:07,157 --> 00:46:09,887
"Because everybody knows
what the 442 is doing.

913
00:46:09,887 --> 00:46:11,497
"And what means most to me is the change

914
00:46:11,497 --> 00:46:12,850
"in the kids in my class."

915
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:13,753
She teaches in camp school.

916
00:46:13,753 --> 00:46:15,747
- I know, I know, first grade.

917
00:46:15,747 --> 00:46:18,187
- "They were such sad little
people, never laughed,

918
00:46:18,187 --> 00:46:19,517
"never made a sound.

919
00:46:19,517 --> 00:46:22,607
"Today, I'm happy to say,
I have as noisy a classroom

920
00:46:22,607 --> 00:46:24,510
"as you'll find in America."

921
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:26,270
- More better now, eh, kotonk?

922
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:27,450
- Looks that way, Kanaka.

923
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:28,493
Plenty better now.

924
00:46:30,117 --> 00:46:32,067
"I miss you so very much, my darling.

925
00:46:32,067 --> 00:46:33,367
"I can't find words to tell you

926
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:35,130
"how dear you are to me."

927
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:48,353
(singing in foreign language)

928
00:46:57,322 --> 00:47:01,239
(shouting in foreign language)

929
00:47:02,826 --> 00:47:03,659
- How was it?

930
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:04,492
How was Rome?

931
00:47:04,492 --> 00:47:05,325
I'll see you tomorrow!

932
00:47:05,325 --> 00:47:06,903
I gotta go to the C.P.
and pick up my pass!

933
00:47:14,788 --> 00:47:16,838
- [Man] End of the line, everybody out.

934
00:47:16,838 --> 00:47:19,588
(men chattering)

935
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:30,257
- Just wanted to let you
know we're back, sir.

936
00:47:30,257 --> 00:47:31,133
- Oh, good.

937
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,020
You're just in time.

938
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,630
- Oh, thanks.

939
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:36,026
- Sergeant, have the driver report

940
00:47:36,026 --> 00:47:37,360
to the motor pool, will ya?

941
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,193
- Yes, sir.

942
00:47:38,193 --> 00:47:39,026
- He's got a full tank, sir.

943
00:47:39,026 --> 00:47:40,870
All set to go with the next batch.

944
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:42,373
- I was all set to go too.

945
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:46,040
Change of orders, we're
going back on the line.

946
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:48,420
- That's kind of rough.

947
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:51,450
Somebody was telling me
your folks came from Rome.

948
00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:52,980
- A little town near there.

949
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,040
Oh, well, I'll get to see it someday.

950
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,280
- Sure you will.

951
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,260
- Hey, we met up with some of your

952
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:58,093
folks while you were gone.

953
00:47:58,093 --> 00:47:59,246
Your old outfit.

954
00:47:59,246 --> 00:48:00,079
- The 36th!

955
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,550
- They passed us on their way back.

956
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:03,220
The Texas Wonders had all they could take

957
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,860
so they called in the 442.

958
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:05,810
- Where'd they go?

959
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:06,870
- The word is they're being moved

960
00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:08,520
to another theater of operations.

961
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:10,690
- Is that straight?

962
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:11,547
- Looks like you're stuck with us

963
00:48:11,547 --> 00:48:12,893
for the rest of the war.

964
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:16,800
- Guy gets in to fight the Japs

965
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,059
and winds up fightin' with 'em.

966
00:48:19,059 --> 00:48:20,750
It's a hot one when you
come to think of it.

967
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:22,430
- Oh, I don't know.

968
00:48:22,430 --> 00:48:25,100
A lot of us have parents who
were born in enemy countries.

969
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,180
Italian Americans, German Americans--

970
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:28,900
- That's different, sir, and you know it.

971
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:29,733
- Why?

972
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,070
- Well, it's just--

973
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:33,950
- The shape of their eyes?

974
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:35,600
Or is it the color of their skin?

975
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:41,970
- Tell the truth, sir,

976
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:44,480
wouldn't you rather be
with some other outfit?

977
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,113
- If I knew of a better
outfit, but I don't.

978
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:51,520
- Will that be all, sir?

979
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,480
- [Colonel] You don't
have to be so formal.

980
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,930
- It was your idea to go by the book.

981
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:56,883
- That was a long time ago.

982
00:48:57,950 --> 00:48:58,950
- I'll see ya later.

983
00:49:05,712 --> 00:49:06,910
- How was it, lieutenant?

984
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,410
- [Grayson] Great!

985
00:49:13,036 --> 00:49:15,869
(bombs exploding)

986
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,050
- I hope the supply sergeant

987
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:21,050
takes good care of your pig.

988
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:23,830
Yep, I sure hope he feeds
him good so he'll be nice

989
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:25,913
and fat when we get back off the line.

990
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,423
- Hey, Frank, look!

991
00:49:30,423 --> 00:49:32,370
Look at that!

992
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:33,770
- Must be an old Roman villa.

993
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:37,175
Yeah, you can tell it's
Roman by those columns.

994
00:49:37,175 --> 00:49:39,675
(guns firing)

995
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:47,970
- Rubble from another war, huh?

996
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:49,380
- It's hard to believe.

997
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,070
Over 2000 years old.

998
00:49:51,070 --> 00:49:53,030
- The battles that must have
been fought around here.

999
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:54,820
Napoleon, Charlemagne, Caesar,

1000
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,030
Alexander the Great,

1001
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:57,870
all the way back to biblical times.

1002
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,410
- More better we fight
like biblical times.

1003
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:01,910
I read in the Bible.

1004
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:03,810
Your army pick number one man,

1005
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:05,417
enemy pick number one man,

1006
00:50:05,417 --> 00:50:08,010
and by big fight, two men,

1007
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:09,920
one killed, war over.

1008
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,070
- I nominate Lieutenant
Grayson for our side.

1009
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:14,263
- No, I wouldn't know who to root for.

1010
00:50:17,902 --> 00:50:22,120
(shouting in foreign language)

1011
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,550
- It's some kind of
headquarters all right,

1012
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:26,068
and it looks like they're
gettin' ready to pull out.

1013
00:50:26,068 --> 00:50:28,672
(guns firing)

1014
00:50:28,672 --> 00:50:30,490
- Yeah, with all their maps and records.

1015
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:32,593
And one machine gun's holding us back.

1016
00:50:36,729 --> 00:50:39,729
(machine whooshing)

1017
00:50:40,755 --> 00:50:42,582
A little more to the right!

1018
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:43,415
30 yards!

1019
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,149
- Got any more?

1020
00:50:45,149 --> 00:50:45,982
Be right back.

1021
00:50:45,982 --> 00:50:47,803
- [Soldier] 30 yards to
the right, can you hear me?

1022
00:50:47,803 --> 00:50:48,813
- [Man Loading Weapon] Yeah, how's this?

1023
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:53,680
(bomb exploding)

1024
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,640
- Come on, let's take a walk.

1025
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,943
Hey, you over there!

1026
00:51:02,895 --> 00:51:04,461
(guns firing)

1027
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:05,294
Not you!

1028
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:11,065
(bomb exploding)

1029
00:51:13,133 --> 00:51:14,966
You take over, Ohhara.

1030
00:51:31,752 --> 00:51:35,669
(shouting in foreign language)

1031
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:40,699
(guns firing)

1032
00:51:44,978 --> 00:51:47,728
(bomb exploding)

1033
00:52:19,652 --> 00:52:21,252
Keep firing that mortar!

1034
00:52:21,252 --> 00:52:22,419
Keep it going!

1035
00:52:30,393 --> 00:52:32,060
Where's that mortar?

1036
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:38,370
(bomb exploding)
(guns firing)

1037
00:52:51,309 --> 00:52:53,883
- I don't think these columns'll
be here for the next war.

1038
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,277
- [Soldier] How about that mortar?

1039
00:52:57,277 --> 00:52:58,527
- [Tommy] Right away!

1040
00:52:58,527 --> 00:52:59,363
I gotta move it!

1041
00:53:16,995 --> 00:53:18,274
- [Soldier] Hurry up with that mortar!

1042
00:53:18,274 --> 00:53:20,024
- [Tommy] Okay, okay!

1043
00:53:26,566 --> 00:53:28,042
- They moved the gun!

1044
00:53:28,042 --> 00:53:30,042
- Right, 50 yards right!

1045
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:38,089
- Short! Short!

1046
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:40,172
Give it another 50 yards!

1047
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:49,360
Now over to the left, just a little!

1048
00:53:54,796 --> 00:53:55,658
That's it!

1049
00:53:55,658 --> 00:53:56,575
Pour it on!

1050
00:54:02,035 --> 00:54:05,702
(shouting foreign language)

1051
00:54:28,093 --> 00:54:29,440
- Hold it! Hold it!

1052
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,140
Cease-fire!

1053
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:31,973
Let's go!

1054
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:43,676
(shouting foreign language)

1055
00:54:43,676 --> 00:54:46,176
(guns firing)

1056
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:14,441
- What kind of troops are these?

1057
00:55:14,441 --> 00:55:15,686
Chinese?

1058
00:55:15,686 --> 00:55:16,761
- Japanese.

1059
00:55:16,761 --> 00:55:18,376
Didn't Hitler tell ya?

1060
00:55:18,376 --> 00:55:22,959
Japan surrendered and they're
fighting on our side now.

1061
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:40,770
- Well, it beats walking.

1062
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:43,618
- Maybe walking through
Italy wasn't so bad.

1063
00:55:43,618 --> 00:55:45,230
Didn't you get the latest latrinogram?

1064
00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:46,220
We're shipping out.

1065
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,063
- Shipping out?

1066
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:50,490
- And so we take leave of sunny Italy

1067
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:52,350
and sail the seven seas to--

1068
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,400
- To where?

1069
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,930
- My guess is the Pacific.

1070
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:57,790
- You really think so, lieutenant?

1071
00:55:57,790 --> 00:55:59,460
- Yeah, but don't worry about it.

1072
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,720
I haven't guessed right once

1073
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,120
since I've been in the Army.

1074
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:11,122
- Watch that stuff!

1075
00:56:11,122 --> 00:56:11,955
- Sorry.

1076
00:56:13,265 --> 00:56:16,598
(slow guitar strumming)

1077
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:25,556
- Tommy!

1078
00:56:25,556 --> 00:56:28,050
(pig snorts)

1079
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:29,820
- Oh, hello, lieutenant.

1080
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,540
- I told you to go easy on that leg.

1081
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:32,373
- [Tommy] Plenty okay now, lieutenant.

1082
00:56:32,373 --> 00:56:34,540
- Well, what did you
leave the hospital for?

1083
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:36,440
- I've been still, lieutenant.

1084
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,273
Three weeks.

1085
00:56:37,273 --> 00:56:39,100
Long time, sir.

1086
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,333
- Don't you realize
officially you're AWOL?

1087
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:44,040
I don't know whether to put
you in for a Silver Star

1088
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,520
or have you court-martialed.

1089
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:47,500
- Gotta leave hospital, sir.

1090
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:49,470
Big rumor, 442 going Pacific.

1091
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:53,550
Me plenty sad sack get left behind, huh?

1092
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:56,290
Sir, maybe we still gonna fight Japan.

1093
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:57,820
You think so, maybe?

1094
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:59,200
- No, Tommy.

1095
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,350
It's definitely France.

1096
00:57:01,803 --> 00:57:03,807
(pig snorting)
(Tommy coughs)

1097
00:57:03,807 --> 00:57:04,640
- It's bad cough.

1098
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,631
I catch him in a hospital.

1099
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:06,493
(pig snorting)
(Tommy coughs)

1100
00:57:06,493 --> 00:57:07,441
More better now, sea air good.

1101
00:57:07,441 --> 00:57:09,610
(pig snorting)
(Tommy coughs)

1102
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:11,230
Well, goodbye, lieutenant.

1103
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:13,860
(pig squealing)
(Tommy coughs)

1104
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:14,853
- Goodbye, Tommy.

1105
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:21,060
You are about to play a personal part

1106
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:24,030
in pushing the Germans out of France.

1107
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:26,770
Just west of the Riviera
district in southern France

1108
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:28,170
lies the port of Marseilles.

1109
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:30,500
You will be fortunate indeed

1110
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,470
if you are stationed in
this fascinating city.

1111
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:35,500
However, the chances are

1112
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,920
you will be located in the provinces.

1113
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,990
Rooms with private bath are still deluxe

1114
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:44,120
in provincial towns, and you
won't always have steam heat,

1115
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,100
but there are many compensations.

1116
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,630
For instance, your
breakfast will be brought

1117
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:51,335
to your bedroom without extra charge.

1118
00:57:51,335 --> 00:57:54,335
(slow gentle music)

1119
00:57:55,247 --> 00:57:57,830
(pig snorting)

1120
00:58:00,281 --> 00:58:01,850
(train horn whistles)

1121
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:03,570
First class on French trains

1122
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:05,800
ranks with our extra-fare trains,

1123
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:07,930
second ranks with our parlor car

1124
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:11,240
and third class is like
our ordinary-day coach.

1125
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:13,970
If French coaches are less
comfortable than ours,

1126
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:16,120
remember that they are
also less expensive.

1127
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,120
It all evens up.

1128
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,453
- Who's got the time?

1129
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,680
- 2:20 sir.

1130
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,860
- Thanks.

1131
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:26,780
- Who do you think that I
oughta see about it, sir?

1132
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,170
- S1 personnel.

1133
00:58:28,170 --> 00:58:30,710
They assign the new replacements,

1134
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:31,640
but they're not gonna put two

1135
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:33,560
brothers in the same platoon.

1136
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,127
- My kid brother's got
a way with him, sir,

1137
00:58:35,127 --> 00:58:37,850
and he's just liable to talk them into it.

1138
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:40,180
- Bad enough being in the same regiment,

1139
00:58:40,180 --> 00:58:41,940
but the same platoon...

1140
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:44,080
- Yeah, I'd hate for my
folks to get two telegrams

1141
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:46,611
from the War Department on the same day.

1142
00:58:46,611 --> 00:58:49,150
(cart clanking)

1143
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,100
- Where are you going?

1144
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,460
- Think I'll ride with my platoon, sir.

1145
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:53,740
- You're overdoing the
"sir" business, lieutenant.

1146
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:54,710
- I keep forgetting.

1147
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:55,722
And here I've been an officer

1148
00:58:55,722 --> 00:58:57,031
for two hours and 20 minutes.

1149
00:58:57,031 --> 00:58:57,864
(men laughing)

1150
00:58:57,864 --> 00:58:59,160
How are you doing, Grayson?

1151
00:59:00,193 --> 00:59:03,455
(horn blowing)

1152
00:59:03,455 --> 00:59:07,288
(singing in foreign language)

1153
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:10,820
- Hey, Sam, you think Terry okay?

1154
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:12,650
- Sure, it was just a little cold.

1155
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,740
- I feel more better
when the mail catch up.

1156
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:16,650
Long time he no get mail.

1157
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:18,230
- I wonder how my brother's making out.

1158
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:19,750
- Me too.

1159
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:21,280
I guess he work on the sugar-beet farm

1160
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,713
already two, three weeks.

1161
00:59:23,636 --> 00:59:25,340
Hey, Ohhara, we want the mail!

1162
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:27,317
- [Ohhara] Write your congressman.

1163
00:59:27,317 --> 00:59:28,577
10-hut!

1164
00:59:28,577 --> 00:59:30,551
(men chattering)

1165
00:59:30,551 --> 00:59:31,384
As you were.

1166
00:59:31,384 --> 00:59:32,440
Carry on, men.

1167
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,273
- How do you like that?

1168
00:59:33,273 --> 00:59:35,306
Do they give a commission
to one of us buddhaheads?

1169
00:59:35,306 --> 00:59:36,790
No, they give it to the mick.

1170
00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:38,280
- Ohhara, the fighting Irishman.

1171
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,070
- Faith, and you can say that again.

1172
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:41,600
Now, get along with your blarney.

1173
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,075
I've got something to tell you.

1174
00:59:43,075 --> 00:59:43,908
- At ease!

1175
00:59:43,908 --> 00:59:44,741
At ease!

1176
00:59:44,741 --> 00:59:46,740
Let's be having a little
military courtesy.

1177
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:48,310
Yes, sir.

1178
00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:50,080
- I haven't been assigned yet,

1179
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:53,030
but it looks like I'll be
taking over another platoon.

1180
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:55,219
I probably won't be
seeing much of you guys.

1181
00:59:55,219 --> 00:59:57,953
I just wanted to say, well, so long.

1182
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,430
- He gonna make good platoon leader.

1183
01:00:03,430 --> 01:00:04,980
- Yeah, while he lasts.

1184
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:06,453
He's welcome to them bars.

1185
01:00:12,193 --> 01:00:13,370
- Sam, look at those buildings!

1186
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:14,203
17th century!

1187
01:00:14,203 --> 01:00:15,493
- [Sam] I'm looking at that bakery.

1188
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:20,813
- Go ahead, Tommy.

1189
01:00:20,813 --> 01:00:22,200
I'll keep an eye on the pig.

1190
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:29,550
- Stick close to the train, you guys.

1191
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:32,060
I'm tired of rounding up stragglers.

1192
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:36,170
(speaking foreign language)

1193
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:37,003
What'd he say?

1194
01:00:37,003 --> 01:00:38,600
- Oh, that's Japanese for thank you.

1195
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,053
They're very polite.

01:01:11,865 --> 01:01:12,960

1208
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:13,793
- When?

1209
01:01:13,793 --> 01:01:14,972
- That's right, when did you learn it?

1210
01:01:14,972 --> 01:01:15,810

1211
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:17,066

01:01:26,506 --> 01:01:28,420
- Ah, last week.

1217
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:29,840
Soldiers.

1218
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:30,673
- 36th Division?

1219
01:01:30,673 --> 01:01:31,670
- I think so.

1220
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:33,037
Big T.

1221
01:01:33,037 --> 01:01:34,269
- Are they still here?

1222
01:01:34,269 --> 01:01:39,269
No, packed yesterday.

01:01:45,136 --> 01:01:47,886
(women laughing)

1225
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,580
- Well, well, the ambassador from Texas.

1226
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,160
- Good afternoon, sir.

1227
01:01:57,160 --> 01:01:59,760
- You know, lieutenant, I had
you down as a determined man,

1228
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,170
but I didn't think you had enough drag

1229
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:02,440
to get the whole darned outfit

1230
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:03,810
transferred to the 36th.

1231
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:04,770
- Transferred?

1232
01:02:04,770 --> 01:02:05,603
- That's right, lieutenant.

1233
01:02:05,603 --> 01:02:07,683
We've been attached to the 36th Division.

1234
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,460
I guess that makes us honorary Texans.

1235
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:13,600
- Well, fan my brow.

1236
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:16,350
Keep an eye out for
cattle-rustlers, partner.

1237
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:17,977
- Well, what do you know about that?

1238
01:02:17,977 --> 01:02:21,086
- I thought you'd be pleased, lieutenant.

1239
01:02:21,086 --> 01:02:22,480
This is the man we've
been looking for, major.

1240
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,840
One of the new combat
commissions to replace him.

1241
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,611
- Well, there's one in
his platoon sir, Ohhara.

1242
01:02:25,611 --> 01:02:27,780
- Good, he can take over.

1243
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:29,990
- Take over my platoon, sir?

1244
01:02:29,990 --> 01:02:31,470
- We've had a request
for a liaison officer

1245
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:33,110
to work out of 36th headquarters.

1246
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:33,943
Someone who can get along with them

1247
01:02:33,943 --> 01:02:35,500
and knows the 442 thoroughly.

1248
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,390
- But, sir, I've always been on the line.

1249
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:38,770
Do you think I have the qualifications

1250
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:39,810
for a headquarter's job?

1251
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:40,740
- I think you'll make good.

1252
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:43,190
When a man wants anything as
badly as you've wanted this.

1253
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:44,930
- But sir, I don't want this.

1254
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:47,070
Remember, I told you I
just wanted to visit them.

1255
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:48,890
I've got a lot of friends in the 36th.

1256
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,489
- None of them at headquarters, I take it.

1257
01:02:50,489 --> 01:02:51,322
(horn blowing)

1258
01:02:51,322 --> 01:02:52,220
Sorry I couldn't arrange to have you

1259
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:53,460
sent back to your platoon.

1260
01:02:53,460 --> 01:02:54,293
- Colonel Pence--

1261
01:02:54,293 --> 01:02:56,150
- Your orders will be issued immediately!

1262
01:03:05,247 --> 01:03:06,314
- All aboard!

1263
01:03:06,314 --> 01:03:07,621
Texas special!

1264
01:03:07,621 --> 01:03:09,393
Dallas, Forth Worth, Galveston,

1265
01:03:09,393 --> 01:03:11,541
Houston and all points south.

1266
01:03:11,541 --> 01:03:13,193
Yeah, man!

1267
01:03:13,193 --> 01:03:16,677
- Ya-hoo!

1268
01:03:16,677 --> 01:03:21,037
(speaking foreign language)

1269
01:03:21,037 --> 01:03:24,718
- [Man] Don't forget to write.

1270
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:27,635
(machines blowing)

1271
01:03:33,530 --> 01:03:36,490
- How do you like that
Texas artillery, strangers?

1272
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:37,323
- Stranger?

1273
01:03:37,323 --> 01:03:38,600
Man, I'm from Texas myself.

1274
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,090
- Well, pull up a chair
and have a mint julep.

1275
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:42,560
- That's mighty neighborly, friend,

1276
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,420
but we're heading back towards town.

1277
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:46,470
Another posse's gonna spell us for a bit.

1278
01:03:48,130 --> 01:03:49,243
Tommy's sure anxious to
get back to that town

1279
01:03:49,243 --> 01:03:51,000
where he left Paisan.

1280
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,273
- Ain't love wonderful?

1281
01:03:55,048 --> 01:03:56,347
- Howdy, stranger!

1282
01:03:56,347 --> 01:03:57,180
- Aloha.

1283
01:04:03,163 --> 01:04:05,150
- There's only one thing I don't

1284
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:06,600
like about these buddhaheads.

1285
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:10,147
They don't dig 'em long enough.

1286
01:04:27,074 --> 01:04:28,270
- Hello, my friend!

1287
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:29,810
He's here, the little Paisan.

1288
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:30,643
He's here.

1289
01:04:34,259 --> 01:04:35,583
- Paisan.

1290
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,416
Hello, Paisan.

1291
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:37,360
You looking good, boy.

1292
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:40,015
You're looking wonderful, Paisan.

1293
01:04:40,015 --> 01:04:40,925
Come on, Paisan.

1294
01:04:40,925 --> 01:04:43,121
You're beautiful, Paisan.

1295
01:04:43,121 --> 01:04:45,871
(Paisan squeals)

1296
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,250
- Nice pig.

1297
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:49,945
He miss you much.

1298
01:04:49,945 --> 01:04:51,500
- I miss him too.

1299
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:54,030
Oh, thanks for taking care of him.

1300
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:54,863
Thanks a lot.

1301
01:04:55,870 --> 01:04:56,703
- Thank you.

1302
01:04:56,703 --> 01:04:57,540
You are very kind.

1303
01:04:58,810 --> 01:04:59,730
- What's the matter?

1304
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:00,563
You don't smoke?

1305
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,200
- Yes, I smoke.

1306
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,790
I was hoping maybe something
to eat for the children.

1307
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:08,520
Chocolate, crackers, anything.

1308
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:11,003
They have so little, so little to eat.

1309
01:05:12,393 --> 01:05:14,520
- I don't have anything to eat.

1310
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:15,620
Trade the cigarettes.

1311
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:16,453
Two packs.

1312
01:05:16,453 --> 01:05:18,280
You can get a couple of chickens for that.

1313
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:19,113
- Not here.

1314
01:05:19,113 --> 01:05:20,140
No chickens left.

1315
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:20,973
Nothing.

1316
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:23,480
- All right.

1317
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:24,620
I'll come back later.

1318
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,320
- I hate to ask.

1319
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,630
- It won't be much.

1320
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:29,680
All we get is K rations.

1321
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,180
- It will be a feast for them.

1322
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,400
I wish I could get something better.

1323
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:40,530
Well, see you later.

1324
01:05:40,530 --> 01:05:42,296
- [Man] Goodbye, my friend.

1325
01:05:42,296 --> 01:05:44,796
(baby crying)

1326
01:06:19,532 --> 01:06:20,365
Thank you.

1327
01:06:20,365 --> 01:06:21,830
Thank you very much.

1328
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:24,084
How wonderful for the children.

1329
01:06:24,084 --> 01:06:26,177
(speaking foreign language)

1330
01:06:26,177 --> 01:06:29,094
(Paisan squealing)

1331
01:06:51,292 --> 01:06:55,125
(singing in foreign language)

1332
01:07:00,375 --> 01:07:01,339
- Kanakas.

1333
01:07:01,339 --> 01:07:02,942
The ones from Hawaii.

1334
01:07:02,942 --> 01:07:05,451
Let's stop a minute, huh?

1335
01:07:05,451 --> 01:07:06,784
I won't be long.

1336
01:07:27,685 --> 01:07:28,739
- [Soldier] Throw those bums out!

1337
01:07:28,739 --> 01:07:29,759
Yeah, go on, get up there.

1338
01:07:29,759 --> 01:07:31,270
- No, they're doing fine!

1339
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:32,707
Come on, hula-hula, Kaz.

1340
01:07:37,038 --> 01:07:37,871
- Kaz!

1341
01:07:38,926 --> 01:07:40,014
- Hey!

1342
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:43,014
(everyone shouting)

1343
01:07:45,808 --> 01:07:49,641
(singing in foreign language)

1344
01:08:05,238 --> 01:08:08,599
(Culley laughing)

1345
01:08:08,599 --> 01:08:10,180
- [Woman] Would you like some wine?

1346
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:13,847
(speaking foreign language)

1347
01:08:14,742 --> 01:08:16,200
- These men, the little ones,

1348
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,840
they are really Japanese?

1349
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,810
- Hey, shorty, she wants
to know if you're Japanese.

1350
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:22,660
I guess we can let her in on it, huh?

1351
01:08:23,690 --> 01:08:25,591
They're our new secret weapon.

1352
01:08:25,591 --> 01:08:27,222
Twilight fighters.

1353
01:08:27,222 --> 01:08:28,055
- Twilight fighters?

1354
01:08:28,055 --> 01:08:29,200
- Yeah.

1355
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,300
The Army gives them shots

1356
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:31,950
to make them turn yellow, see.

1357
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:33,500
They send them out in the evening,

1358
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,140
just as the sun's going down.

1359
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:36,433
The enemy can't see 'em in that light.

1360
01:08:36,433 --> 01:08:37,703
Get the idea?

1361
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:40,720
- That guy's been looking
for trouble all night.

1362
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,070
If he makes one more crack, I'll--

1363
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:42,903
- [Grayson] Tommy!

1364
01:08:42,903 --> 01:08:43,736
How are you?
- Lieutenant Grayson!

1365
01:08:43,736 --> 01:08:44,569
- [Grayson] How's the leg?

1366
01:08:44,569 --> 01:08:45,402
- Fit like a fiddle.

1367
01:08:45,402 --> 01:08:46,400
- Hiya, fellas.
- Howdy, Grayson.

1368
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,408
- [Grayson] Say, who's your friend,

1369
01:08:47,408 --> 01:08:48,241
the one with all the stripes?

1370
01:08:48,241 --> 01:08:49,074
- [Sam] They don't care who they make

1371
01:08:49,074 --> 01:08:49,907
platoon sergeant anymore.

1372
01:08:49,907 --> 01:08:51,880
- How about having a
refill with us lieutenant?

1373
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:53,260
- Thanks Frank, I wanna
say hello to somebody,

1374
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:54,270
my old platoon sergeant.

1375
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:55,200
I trained under him.

1376
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,206
Be right back.

1377
01:08:56,206 --> 01:08:57,421
Culley!

1378
01:08:57,421 --> 01:08:58,254
- Grayson!

1379
01:08:58,254 --> 01:08:59,087
- [Grayson] How are you?

1380
01:08:59,087 --> 01:08:59,920
- Lieutenant Grayson.

1381
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:00,753
- [Grayson] Yeah, how about that?

1382
01:09:00,753 --> 01:09:01,586
- How about a drink?

1383
01:09:01,586 --> 01:09:02,419
- [Grayson] Great, great.

1384
01:09:02,419 --> 01:09:03,970
Come on, there's room down here.

1385
01:09:04,994 --> 01:09:07,140
- That guy would be a buddy of Grayson's.

1386
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:09,110
- Five to one he don't
come back for that drink.

1387
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:10,010
- [Sam] Get it up.

1388
01:09:13,250 --> 01:09:15,424
- They tell me you really got it made.

1389
01:09:15,424 --> 01:09:16,720
What is this liaison racket?

1390
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:18,540
- Oh, it varies, from a soft snap

1391
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:20,270
to an extra soft snap.

1392
01:09:20,270 --> 01:09:21,280
Thank you.

1393
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:22,850
Tomorrow I'm moving out with you.

1394
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:23,683
How do you like that?

1395
01:09:23,683 --> 01:09:25,070
Back with the old platoon.

1396
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:26,630
- You mean, I gotta take orders from you?

1397
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:29,570
- No, I don't mess around
with you dog faces.

1398
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:31,560
I'll be with the artillery observer.

1399
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,290
You're getting your
artillery from the 442,

1400
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:35,570
and he's never worked with them before.

1401
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:37,720
- They're sending us up
without our own artillery?

1402
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:38,743
Just the Japs?

1403
01:09:41,233 --> 01:09:42,580
- They're a good outfit, Culley.

1404
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:43,790
Plenty good.

1405
01:09:43,790 --> 01:09:44,720
- Practically winning the war

1406
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:46,270
single-handed from what I hear.

1407
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:48,043
Japs.

1408
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:52,400
- Let's get outta here, huh?

1409
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,350
- Yeah, I could use a little fresh air.

1410
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:01,846
- [Sam] You win, Chick.

1411
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:06,750
- Japs in a Texas division.

1412
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:07,973
Man, oh, man!

1413
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,830
- Come here a minute.

1414
01:10:13,437 --> 01:10:15,680
Culley, they're not Japs.

1415
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:16,513
- Huh?

1416
01:10:16,513 --> 01:10:17,680
- They're Japanese Americans.

1417
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,552
Nisei, or, if you prefer, buddhaheads.

1418
01:10:20,552 --> 01:10:21,920
But not Japs.

1419
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,540
They don't like it and neither do I.

1420
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:25,280
- What are you, a Jap-lover or something?

1421
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,700
- I said they're not Japs.

1422
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,150
I'm warning ya, Culley.

1423
01:10:28,150 --> 01:10:28,983
- You're what?

1424
01:10:28,983 --> 01:10:29,970
- Warning ya.

1425
01:10:29,970 --> 01:10:32,770
- Lieutenant, that gold bar
looks real sweet on you,

1426
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:33,650
but I do believe you're getting

1427
01:10:33,650 --> 01:10:35,020
a little big for your britches.

1428
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:36,410
- I can always take the bar off.

1429
01:10:36,410 --> 01:10:37,613
- Any time you say.

1430
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:45,948
(face punching)

1431
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:55,143
(Culley grunting)

1432
01:10:59,650 --> 01:11:03,127
(engine revving)

1433
01:11:03,127 --> 01:11:03,960
- Okara!

1434
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:04,793
- [Okara] Yo!

1435
01:11:04,793 --> 01:11:05,731
- Misoka.

1436
01:11:05,731 --> 01:11:06,908
- [Misoka] Here! Here!

1437
01:11:06,908 --> 01:11:07,741
- Nishigoka.

1438
01:11:07,741 --> 01:11:08,574
- [Nishigoka] Hey!

1439
01:11:08,574 --> 01:11:09,407
- No letters?

1440
01:11:09,407 --> 01:11:10,270
- Keep your pants on.

1441
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:11,150
- Come on, snap it up.

1442
01:11:11,150 --> 01:11:12,097
- Kiri!

1443
01:11:12,097 --> 01:11:13,320
- [Kiri] Yo-ho!

1444
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,470
- Kamakura!

1445
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:15,303
- [Kamakura] Oh, here, here!

1446
01:11:15,303 --> 01:11:16,233
I take it!

1447
01:11:16,233 --> 01:11:17,808
- Cookies!

1448
01:11:17,808 --> 01:11:18,862
- Ikagani!

1449
01:11:18,862 --> 01:11:20,150
- Here!

1450
01:11:20,150 --> 01:11:21,067
- One cookie!

1451
01:11:21,067 --> 01:11:23,650
(men laughing)

1452
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:25,990
- Hey, look!

1453
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:27,746
How you like that, two sets.

1454
01:11:27,746 --> 01:11:29,079
I go see Masami!

1455
01:11:32,298 --> 01:11:33,140
Two sets.

1456
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:34,512
- [Tommy] Sam, Sam, wiki-wiki.

1457
01:11:34,512 --> 01:11:36,030
- I'm wiki-wikiing as fast as I can.

1458
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:37,090
Anything from my brother?

1459
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:39,280
- No, all from relocation center.

1460
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,733
Sugar report from Terry.

1461
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:47,477
"Dear Sam, I hate to start
out a letter this way,

1462
01:11:47,477 --> 01:11:50,190
"but I think it best to get
the bad news over with first."

1463
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:51,770
- Her cold, she no get better, huh?

1464
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:53,220
- No, Terry's okay.

1465
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:54,150
- Your mother been get sick?

1466
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:55,140
Your father?

1467
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:56,502
- It's my brother.

1468
01:11:56,502 --> 01:11:58,030
- He been lose his job on the farm?

1469
01:11:58,030 --> 01:11:59,620
Yeah, him and a couple of his buddies.

1470
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:00,477
A gang beat them to a pulp

1471
01:12:00,477 --> 01:12:02,550
and said they'd lynch them
if they ever came back.

1472
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:03,789
- Why they do that?

1473
01:12:03,789 --> 01:12:04,622
Why?

1474
01:12:04,622 --> 01:12:05,455
- Why?

1475
01:12:05,455 --> 01:12:06,288
Because they've got slant eyes.

1476
01:12:06,288 --> 01:12:08,430
That's a crime in some
places, didn't you know that?

1477
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:09,560
How do ya like that?

1478
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:10,700
We're good enough to carry rifles,

1479
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:12,620
but we're not good enough
to pick sugar beets.

1480
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:14,190
- Take it easy, Sam.

1481
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:16,130
- Sure, sure, take it easy.

1482
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:17,520
Take it lying down.

1483
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,050
- Go on, beat it!

1484
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:19,883
Blow off!

1485
01:12:19,883 --> 01:12:20,716
- Ain't I been telling you?

1486
01:12:20,716 --> 01:12:21,549
Suckers, that's what we are.

1487
01:12:21,549 --> 01:12:22,640
- Ah, chick, chick, chick,

1488
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,123
chick, chick, chick.

1489
01:12:24,123 --> 01:12:25,920
- How would you like a dental appointment?

1490
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:26,753
- Let's go, boy!

1491
01:12:26,753 --> 01:12:27,586
Katonk.

1492
01:12:27,586 --> 01:12:28,419
- Break it up!

1493
01:12:28,419 --> 01:12:29,252
If you're looking for a scrap,

1494
01:12:29,252 --> 01:12:30,490
you won't have long to wait.

1495
01:12:30,490 --> 01:12:31,440
We've been alerted.

1496
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,222
Pull your tents down and
get ready to move out.

1497
01:12:33,222 --> 01:12:34,055
- Pull 'em down?

1498
01:12:34,055 --> 01:12:35,310
We just put 'em up.

1499
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:36,520
- The men Lieutenant Grayson moved out

1500
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,700
with have been surrounded.

1501
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:38,713
- The whole battalion?

1502
01:12:38,713 --> 01:12:39,546
- What's left of 'em.

1503
01:12:39,546 --> 01:12:41,160
Grayson's okay so far.

1504
01:12:41,160 --> 01:12:43,080
Artillery observer got
hit and he took over.

1505
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,040
- Just so the lieutenant is safe.

1506
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,370
Him and his buddy.

1507
01:12:46,370 --> 01:12:48,033
- His dear old platoon sergeant.

1508
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:52,930
- What's up with Sam?

1509
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:54,580
- He just got some bad news.

1510
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:55,990
- He's not the only one.

1511
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:57,550
They're gonna send the new
replacements up on line

1512
01:12:57,550 --> 01:12:58,730
as soon as they arrive,

1513
01:12:58,730 --> 01:13:01,000
the batch my kid brother's in.

1514
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:01,883
18-years-old.

1515
01:13:06,321 --> 01:13:09,154
(bombs exploding)

1516
01:13:14,986 --> 01:13:16,236
- Hey, Grayson!

1517
01:13:18,368 --> 01:13:19,201
- [Soldier] Medic!

1518
01:13:19,201 --> 01:13:20,456
Where's the medic?

1519
01:13:20,456 --> 01:13:21,289
- [Soldier] There he is!

1520
01:13:21,289 --> 01:13:22,539
Over here, Joe!

1521
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:26,566
I found a full one.

1522
01:13:26,566 --> 01:13:27,793
- Thanks, pal.

1523
01:13:27,793 --> 01:13:29,493
- Give me a slug of that, will ya?

1524
01:13:31,685 --> 01:13:34,518
(bombs exploding)

1525
01:13:35,495 --> 01:13:36,745
- Hey, Grayson!

1526
01:13:38,351 --> 01:13:39,184
Look out!

1527
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:48,533
- [Grayson] You okay, Culley?

1528
01:13:48,533 --> 01:13:50,470
- Where's that Jap artillery?

1529
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:51,303
Where is it?

1530
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:56,063
- Wildcat six.

1531
01:13:56,063 --> 01:13:56,900
This is Wildcat two.

1532
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,230
Fire mission, over.

1533
01:13:58,230 --> 01:13:59,233
Fire mission point.

1534
01:14:00,205 --> 01:14:03,200
(bomb exploding)

1535
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:06,110
Fire mission point,
Fox-Able-Easy-Baker-Mike-Charlie,

1536
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:09,560
and point,
King-Sugar-Charlie-Love-Able-How.

1537
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,100
- Wildcat two, this is Wildcat six.

1538
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:11,963
Stand by.

1539
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,160
One round smoke on way.

1540
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,527
One round smoke on way.

1541
01:14:27,975 --> 01:14:31,642
(speaking foreign language)

1542
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:41,390
- Can't get a thing outta this one, sir.

1543
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:42,290
- We got enough from the others.

1544
01:14:42,290 --> 01:14:43,919
Send him over to division headquarters.

1545
01:14:43,919 --> 01:14:47,586
(speaking foreign language)

1546
01:14:58,700 --> 01:14:59,570
- Get anything?

1547
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:00,440
- Yes, sir.

1548
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:01,500
Added to what we already know,

1549
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,300
I can give ya a pretty clear picture.

1550
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,133
- Good.

1551
01:15:04,133 --> 01:15:05,250
- It's all dense woods.

1552
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:07,160
Those roads on the map
are just forest trails,

1553
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,366
and Jerry has roadblocks on all of 'em.

1554
01:15:09,366 --> 01:15:10,640
The men are surrounded on three sides

1555
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,400
by elements of the
338th Infantry Division,

1556
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,040
the 198th Fusilier Battalion,

1557
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,220
and the 202nd Mountain Battalion.

1558
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:18,053
To the northeast--

1559
01:15:18,053 --> 01:15:19,763
- Well, let me see it on the map, captain.

1560
01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:21,990
- Well, starting here,

1561
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:24,610
the Germans are dug in
on a continuous line

1562
01:15:24,610 --> 01:15:26,053
all the way around to here.

1563
01:15:26,998 --> 01:15:28,303
There's a gap here,

1564
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:30,380
and one here that I know of,

1565
01:15:30,380 --> 01:15:31,213
but they're covered by

1566
01:15:31,213 --> 01:15:33,350
machine guns with interlocking fire.

1567
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:35,920
There's a steep ridge here
that dominates this sector.

1568
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:37,520
It's almost straight up on both sides,

1569
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:39,870
and they have a strong
force sitting up on top.

1570
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:43,530
- [Colonel] How far away from
here is the lost battalion?

1571
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:46,110
- [Soldier] Well, I'd say 1,000 yards.

1572
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:47,943
They're just about here.

1573
01:15:49,348 --> 01:15:50,181
- [Colonel] We'll have troops within

1574
01:15:50,181 --> 01:15:52,147
striking distance tonight.

1575
01:15:52,147 --> 01:15:54,897
(fire crackling)

1576
01:16:00,250 --> 01:16:02,070
- All right, Ohhara, this is your spot.

1577
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:02,903
Good luck.

1578
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:11,330
- Come on, shake a leg, will ya?

1579
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:13,410
- This don't make sense.

1580
01:16:13,410 --> 01:16:14,463
Sticking our necks out for guys

1581
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:16,140
like that buddy of Grayson's.

1582
01:16:16,140 --> 01:16:16,973
That sergeant, that's the kind

1583
01:16:16,973 --> 01:16:18,820
who ganged up on your brother.

1584
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:20,140
- We get to the lost battalion,

1585
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:21,080
that sergeant gonna change

1586
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:23,250
his mind about us buddhaheads.

1587
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:25,300
Plenty people already we change, eh, Sam?

1588
01:16:30,410 --> 01:16:32,490
Keeps up like Terry been writing letters,

1589
01:16:32,490 --> 01:16:33,920
by and by we gonna have it good.

1590
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,610
You bet, yes, sir.

1591
01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:36,710
Good thing you read me letters,

1592
01:16:36,710 --> 01:16:38,260
or maybe I go get like Chick.

1593
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,400
It's rough, it's plenty rough.

1594
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:41,730
But we know what's it all about.

1595
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:42,990
You bet.

1596
01:16:42,990 --> 01:16:44,900
More better we go for broke, yes, Sam?

1597
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,280
- That's about it, Tommy.

1598
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:47,680
More better we go for broke.

1599
01:17:00,653 --> 01:17:02,413
(wind rustling)

1600
01:17:02,413 --> 01:17:05,163
(bomb exploding)

1601
01:17:06,482 --> 01:17:07,585
- Ohhara.

1602
01:17:07,585 --> 01:17:08,418
Ohhara!

1603
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:18,663
Is it bad?

1604
01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:20,970
- Million-dollar wound.

1605
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:23,657
Luck of the Irish.

1606
01:17:25,097 --> 01:17:27,841
(wind rustling)

1607
01:17:27,841 --> 01:17:30,591
(bomb exploding)

1608
01:17:34,553 --> 01:17:36,187
- Medics!

1609
01:17:36,187 --> 01:17:37,732
Medics!

1610
01:17:37,732 --> 01:17:38,565
Medics!

1611
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,310
- [Soldier] Let's go!

1612
01:18:07,310 --> 01:18:09,870
- I'm glad you have someone to lean on.

1613
01:18:09,870 --> 01:18:11,373
I don't seem to recognize you.

1614
01:18:11,373 --> 01:18:13,920
Have you been back to any of the services?

1615
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:14,753
- No, Father.

1616
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:17,500
I'm not Catholic.

1617
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:18,333
- You're not?

1618
01:18:19,860 --> 01:18:21,210
- Different kind of rosary.

1619
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,823
I'm Buddhist, Father.

1620
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,910
- I'll be here if you want me.

1621
01:18:35,142 --> 01:18:37,975
(bombs exploding)

1622
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:02,363
(rustling winds)

1623
01:19:02,363 --> 01:19:05,113
(bomb exploding)

1624
01:19:06,163 --> 01:19:08,453
- We're gonna try to make contact.

1625
01:19:08,453 --> 01:19:09,750
(plane whirring)

1626
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:12,113
The Piper Cub's calling
the shots for artillery.

1627
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:18,240
They're trying to shoot
us in some rations.

1628
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:19,590
- That'll be a big help.

1629
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:20,773
Sukiyaki and rice.

1630
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:23,220
- I could use another man.

1631
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:32,010
- Well, the Piper Cub pilot

1632
01:19:32,010 --> 01:19:34,030
says there's at least
100 of 'em on this ridge.

1633
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:35,620
And they'll be shooting
right down our throats

1634
01:19:35,620 --> 01:19:38,070
if we try to come up from either side.

1635
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:39,180
Our engineers have been cutting

1636
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:40,340
through a road on top of the ridge

1637
01:19:40,340 --> 01:19:41,350
so we can bring up a tank.

1638
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:43,010
They're about here now.

1639
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:44,350
But once that tank gets within range--

1640
01:19:44,350 --> 01:19:45,970
- When will that be?

1641
01:19:45,970 --> 01:19:46,803
- Hard to say, sir.

1642
01:19:46,803 --> 01:19:47,636
It's slow going.
(phone ringing)

1643
01:19:47,636 --> 01:19:49,390
Minefields all over the place.

1644
01:19:49,390 --> 01:19:50,410
- Tell division headquarters

1645
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:51,614
I'm on my way back, will you?

1646
01:19:51,614 --> 01:19:55,281
(speaking foreign language)

1647
01:19:56,953 --> 01:19:58,480
- The Jerries have been
tapping the wires, sir.

1648
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,819
Some of them speak perfect English.

1649
01:20:00,819 --> 01:20:03,650
(speaking foreign language)

1650
01:20:03,650 --> 01:20:04,483
- Wildcat three.

1651
01:20:04,483 --> 01:20:05,460
Wildcat three.

1652
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:07,743
Sergeant Yasugomoto speaking.

1653
01:20:07,743 --> 01:20:10,860
(speaking foreign language)

1654
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:12,800
Wildcat three, this is Wildcat four.

1655
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:13,950
Come in, Wildcat three.

1656
01:20:14,839 --> 01:20:16,070
(speaking foreign language)

1657
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:16,920
Wildcat three.

1658
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:17,753
Wildcat three.

1659
01:20:17,753 --> 01:20:19,780
Sergeant Yasugomoto speaking.
(bomb exploding)

1660
01:20:19,780 --> 01:20:20,700
Wildcat three.

1661
01:20:20,700 --> 01:20:21,533
Wildcat three.

1662
01:20:21,533 --> 01:20:23,839
Sergeant Yasugomoto speaking.

1663
01:20:23,839 --> 01:20:26,260
(speaking foreign language)

1664
01:20:26,260 --> 01:20:27,440
- Good idea, sergeant.

1665
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:28,273
- Thank you, sir.

1666
01:20:28,273 --> 01:20:30,838
It's just that good old Yankee know-how.

1667
01:20:30,838 --> 01:20:34,505
(speaking foreign language)

1668
01:20:36,930 --> 01:20:39,680
(metal clanking)

1669
01:21:02,824 --> 01:21:04,657
- [Soldier] Watch out!

1670
01:21:08,876 --> 01:21:11,626
(tree exploding)

1671
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:33,440
- If I was a Jerry on
the end of this ridge

1672
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,677
and a tank got close
enough to fire point-blank,

1673
01:21:36,677 --> 01:21:39,220
I'd take off like a ruptured duck.

1674
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:40,240
- Yeah.

1675
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:42,420
- Right over the side of the ridge.

1676
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:44,310
- There oughta be somebody
down there to meet 'em.

1677
01:21:44,310 --> 01:21:45,760
- That's what I was thinking.

1678
01:21:47,273 --> 01:21:48,190
- Let's go.

1679
01:21:54,744 --> 01:21:56,310
- Hey, sergeant!

1680
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:57,880
Sergeant!

1681
01:21:57,880 --> 01:21:59,290
Where's Lieutenant Ohhara's platoon?

1682
01:21:59,290 --> 01:22:00,180
- This is it.

1683
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:01,660
- We're your new replacements.

1684
01:22:01,660 --> 01:22:02,820
Ohhara's the name.

1685
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:04,233
Another suntanned Irishman.

1686
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:07,953
- Come on.

1687
01:22:22,568 --> 01:22:23,401
Ohhara!

1688
01:22:31,892 --> 01:22:34,725
(bombs exploding)

1689
01:23:35,986 --> 01:23:38,486
(guns firing)

1690
01:24:04,271 --> 01:24:05,521
- They're Japs!

1691
01:24:06,717 --> 01:24:08,967
Hey, knock it off, will ya?

1692
01:24:11,667 --> 01:24:12,843
- What's the password?

1693
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:17,550
- Dipsy doodle, that's it.

1694
01:24:17,550 --> 01:24:19,223
- That was it, a week ago.

1695
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:22,940
- Let's have that password!

1696
01:24:24,034 --> 01:24:25,313
One.

1697
01:24:25,313 --> 01:24:26,380
Two.

1698
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:29,840
(speaking foreign language)

1699
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:30,733
Come on out!

1700
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,910
- Make 'em give you the right password.

1701
01:24:37,910 --> 01:24:38,880
- You ever hear a Jerry try

1702
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,360
to pronounce a Japanese word?

1703
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,970
If that's not a buddhahead, I'll...

1704
01:24:42,970 --> 01:24:44,320
- [Soldier] You'll what?

1705
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,660
- Sam, Chick, Tommy!

1706
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:50,100
- A whole battalion's lost,
and we gotta find them.

1707
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:51,220
- Man, I never thought I'd be

1708
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:52,893
so happy to see a bunch of Japs.

1709
01:24:54,790 --> 01:24:56,350
Pardon me, Japanese.

1710
01:24:56,350 --> 01:24:57,183
I mean, Nisei.

1711
01:24:58,050 --> 01:24:59,140
No, that ain't it.

1712
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:00,557
What is it, Grayson?

1713
01:25:00,557 --> 01:25:01,469
- Buddhaheads.

1714
01:25:01,469 --> 01:25:02,729
- [Culley] Okay, okay.

1715
01:25:02,729 --> 01:25:05,229
(guns firing)

1716
01:25:09,654 --> 01:25:10,970
- Buddhaheads, huh?

1717
01:25:10,970 --> 01:25:11,803
- That's right.

1718
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:14,980
- He sure is touchy about that.

1719
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:16,580
One time, he even slugged me.

1720
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:17,790
- Slugged you, huh?

1721
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:20,010
Did you hear that, Chick?

1722
01:25:23,873 --> 01:25:26,230
Where's the rest of
your outfit, lieutenant?

1723
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:27,700
- Back there about a mile.

1724
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:29,050
But it took us hours to get here.

1725
01:25:29,050 --> 01:25:30,790
On our bellies, most of the way.

1726
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:32,300
- [Sam] When do we start?

1727
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:35,210
- Not enough of us would
make it to do 'em any good.

1728
01:25:35,210 --> 01:25:36,610
- What do we do, lieutenant?

1729
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,810
- That's up to you, Sam.

1730
01:25:39,810 --> 01:25:41,493
I'm strictly a liaison officer.

1731
01:25:42,770 --> 01:25:44,490
- [Sam] Skirmish line up the hill.

1732
01:25:44,490 --> 01:25:45,585
- [Culley] Skirmish line up the hill.

1733
01:25:45,585 --> 01:25:47,262
- [Chick] Skirmish line up the hill.

1734
01:25:47,262 --> 01:25:49,022
- [Solider] Skirmish line up the hill.

1735
01:25:49,022 --> 01:25:50,477
- [Soldier] Skirmish line up the hill.

1736
01:25:50,477 --> 01:25:52,430
- [Soldier] Skirmish line up the hill.

1737
01:25:52,430 --> 01:25:53,550
- Tell me something, Sam.

1738
01:25:53,550 --> 01:25:56,270
What does (speaking
foreign language) mean?

1739
01:25:56,270 --> 01:26:00,037
- Well, freely translated: You're a heel.

1740
01:26:00,890 --> 01:26:02,370
A stupid jerk and a heel.

1741
01:26:04,274 --> 01:26:05,747
- That was putting it mildly.

1742
01:26:08,222 --> 01:26:09,972
- [Sam] Go for broke!

1743
01:26:18,099 --> 01:26:20,599
(guns firing)

1744
01:26:24,034 --> 01:26:25,923
(rustling winds)

1745
01:26:25,923 --> 01:26:28,673
(bomb exploding)

1746
01:26:29,977 --> 01:26:32,477
(guns firing)

1747
01:26:41,305 --> 01:26:44,972
(speaking foreign language)

1748
01:27:04,101 --> 01:27:06,768
(man screaming)

1749
01:27:07,773 --> 01:27:09,023
- Go for broke!

1750
01:27:20,795 --> 01:27:22,462
- [Soldier] Grenade!

1751
01:27:28,723 --> 01:27:29,806
Go for broke!

1752
01:27:32,899 --> 01:27:35,899
(soldier screaming)

1753
01:27:39,058 --> 01:27:40,558
- Look out, Tommy!

1754
01:27:51,976 --> 01:27:53,323
- Is that all there were?

1755
01:27:53,323 --> 01:27:55,892
- They went thataway, partner.

1756
01:27:55,892 --> 01:27:58,617
- [Culley] Go for broke!

1757
01:27:58,617 --> 01:28:01,617
(suspenseful music)

1758
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:11,780
(grenade exploding)

1759
01:28:12,631 --> 01:28:15,964
(slow triumphant music)

1760
01:28:28,938 --> 01:28:30,521
- Yahoo!

1761
01:28:30,521 --> 01:28:33,104
(men cheering)

1762
01:28:42,602 --> 01:28:43,983
- Any of you guys want a cigarette?

1763
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:53,484
- [Soldier] Bye, you buddhaheads!

1764
01:28:53,484 --> 01:28:54,865
- [Soldier] So long!

1765
01:28:54,865 --> 01:28:56,710
- [Soldier] Ride 'em, cowboy.

1766
01:28:56,710 --> 01:28:57,543
- [Soldier] Bye!

1767
01:28:57,543 --> 01:28:58,483
Thanks a lot, Jack.

1768
01:29:00,688 --> 01:29:03,154
- [Jack] See you in Berlin.

1769
01:29:03,154 --> 01:29:04,638
- [Soldier] Look out
for that mademoiselle.

1770
01:29:04,638 --> 01:29:05,962
- [Soldier] Take it easy.

1771
01:29:05,962 --> 01:29:07,000
- [Soldier] So long.

1772
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:07,833
- Thanks.

1773
01:29:10,236 --> 01:29:12,330
(speaking foreign language)

1774
01:29:12,330 --> 01:29:13,293
- Goodbye, you all.

1775
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:17,476
So long.

1776
01:29:19,443 --> 01:29:20,276
- I'll be seein' ya.

1777
01:29:20,276 --> 01:29:21,133
- Aloha, partner!

1778
01:29:22,677 --> 01:29:25,427
(men chattering)

1779
01:29:27,582 --> 01:29:30,499
(triumphant music)

1780
01:29:36,583 --> 01:29:39,166
(horn blowing)

1781
01:29:55,620 --> 01:29:57,190
- [Man] Battle honors.

1782
01:29:57,190 --> 01:29:59,600
By order of the secretary of war,

1783
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,495
in the name of the President
of the United States,

1784
01:30:02,495 --> 01:30:06,900
as public evidence of deserved
honor and distinction,

1785
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:09,940
the 442nd Regimental Combat Team

1786
01:30:09,940 --> 01:30:13,103
is cited for outstanding
accomplishment in combat.

1787
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,400
The gallantry and esprit
de corps displayed

1788
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:19,610
by their officers and men in bitter action

1789
01:30:19,610 --> 01:30:22,050
against a formidable enemy

1790
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:24,780
exemplify the finest traditions

1791
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:26,992
of the Armed Forces of the United States.

1792
01:30:26,992 --> 01:30:30,492
(upbeat triumphant music)

1793
01:30:42,569 --> 01:30:45,319
(dramatic music)
