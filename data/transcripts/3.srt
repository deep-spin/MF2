1
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:33,959  
Let's have a drink!

2
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,959  
Come on, I said, let's have a drink!

3
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,959  
What about the pitch?

4
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:40,959  
Don't worry.

5
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:42,959  
Big soldiers are in town.

6
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,959  
Come on, take a look.

7
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:46,959  
Come on.

8
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,959  
We stopped in Tokyo.

9
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:52,959  
You should know that better.

10
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,959  
This place isn't without restrictions.

11
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:55,959  
No, but those girls are.

12
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:58,959  
Sarge, you act like you don’t know what we’re doing.

13
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,959  
My colonel says we’re ambassadors of kindness.

14
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:04,959  
We’re just trying to build friendly relations with our little Japanese friend.

15
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,959  
Aren’t we?

16
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:08,959  
I don’t think you heard everything the colonel said.

17
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:09,959  
Let’s go.

18
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:12,959  
My colonel doesn’t like when you interfere in my affairs.

19
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,959  
Just mind your own business.

20
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:15,959  
We’re not going to fight.

21
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,959  
Right, ambassador?

22
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,959  
Okay, you got your joke.

23
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:24,959  
Now get it together and get out of here.

24
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,959  
No one tells me what to do.

25
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,959  
You better calm down, soldier.

26
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:34,959  
Step away.

27
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:39,959  
Help your friend.

28
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:42,959  
Please, no trouble.

29
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,959  
Get them out of here, Nakamura.

30
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:45,959  
Get them out, get them out.

31
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,959  
I should pull you out, soldier.

32
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,959  
But I think you've had enough.

33
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,959  
Shut your column and stop crying.

34
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,959  
If I find any of you in this area again,

35
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:56,959  
I'll hand you the book.

36
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,959  
Now move.

37
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,959  
Did the soldier boys drink too much?

38
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:06,959  
They drank, Nakamura.

39
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,959  
And it wasn’t tea like your little girls drink.

40
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:13,959  
Soldier doesn’t understand.

41
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,959  
You don’t understand, Nakamura.

42
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,959  
White girls with GIs.

43
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,959  
But the girls are good girls.

44
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:21,959  
They entertain the GIs.

45
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:22,959  
They talk to them.

46
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,959  
They don’t even drink.

47
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,959  
Look, we’ve all been through this.

48
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,959  
But all the nightclubs in Tokyo

49
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,959  
have girls who entertain GIs.

50
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:36,959  
Entertaining is one thing.

51
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:37,959  
White girls are another.

52
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,959  
Will Ginza be without restrictions?

53
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:41,959  
I’m just reporting what I see.

54
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:42,959  
I don’t make the rules.

55
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:43,959  
I don’t make the rules.

56
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:23,959  
I wait for the day you come back to me.

57
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:28,959  
Then the white bird will sing,

58
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:34,959  
And the bird will fly away.

59
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:39,959  
And it will greet the spring on the mountain,

60
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,959  
And it will now shine upon the Message

61
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:44,959  
And she will be loved again

62
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,959  
And she will serve again

63
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:52,959  
So be honest

64
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,959  
Truly

65
00:07:55,959 --> 00:08:02,959  
So be honest

66
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:08,959  
Because she will serve again

67
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,959  
And she will be loved again

68
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:14,959  
And she will serve again

69
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,959  
So be honest

70
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:21,959  
Truly

71
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:25,959  
So be honest

72
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,959  
Because she will serve

73
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:30,959  
Actually, she’s one of the most popular actresses in Tokyo

74
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:33,960  
I suppose she’ll land a major role in the States

75
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,960  
Maybe

76
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,960  
Listen, Bronson, you didn’t come here for a personal interview, did you?

77
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,960  
Nakamura asked me to talk to him

78
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,960  
You're wasting your time

-5
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
from home.

-4
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Dozo.

-3
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Zimbabwe, Sumi.

-2
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Hello, Robert.

-1
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll be through soon.

0
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Ah!

1
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Patani.

2
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Sorry.

3
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I forgot.

4
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:01,759
I guess I'll never learn.

5
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,759
Do not forget.

6
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:05,760
You like to tease me.

7
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,760
Don't you like me to tease you?

8
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,760
Well, come on.

9
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,760
If you don't like it, I promise I'll never do it again.

10
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,760
Like sometimes.

11
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,760
Do you like me to kiss you?

12
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,760
Sometimes.

13
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
Sometimes?

14
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,519
Most times.

15
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,519
Now?

16
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:31,519
Now.

17
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,519
You are beautiful.

18
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,519
Sumi, men are not beautiful.

19
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,519
Women are beautiful.

20
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,519
What are men?

21
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:49,519
Well, they can be handsome or good-looking, but never beautiful.

22
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,519
You are beautiful.

23
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,519
And you can't speak English.

24
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,519
I can't, too.

25
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,279
Pretty hair.

26
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,279
Beautiful face.

27
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,279
Good head.

28
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,279
Smart.

29
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,279
Nice eyes.

30
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,279
Beautiful eyes.

31
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:09,279
Strong chin.

32
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:11,279
And you have cute lips.

33
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,279
And you have kissable lips.

34
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,279
Ah, I see.

35
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:19,039
Ah, I see.

36
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:30,039
You really are beautiful, Sumi.

37
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,039
And you are handsome.

38
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,039
Now you got it straight.

39
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:36,039
That's the way a wife should talk.

40
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,039
I am not your wife yet.

41
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:39,039
Oh, okay.

42
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,039
Be independent now.

43
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:42,039
But you wait till I get you back in Illinois.

44
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:44,039
I'll show you who's boss.

45
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
I will be a good wife.

46
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,800
I want to learn all the American ways.

47
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
I want you to be proud of me.

48
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
I'm proud of you just the way you are.

49
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,800
Better leave now.

50
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
I have to get ready for the next show.

51
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,800
You must go.

52
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,800
All right.

53
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,800
I'm going.

54
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
Clumsy.

55
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
Clumsy?

56
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
I mean clumsy.

57
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Yeah, I know what you meant.

58
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,800
I like teas, too.

59
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
Well, I'll tell you what I'll do.

60
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
I'll get you a big new fan when we get to America.

61
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
A big fan?

62
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Sure.

63
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
Electric fan.

64
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,800
Baka me.

65
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,800
What's that?

66
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:44,559
You are crazy.

67
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,559
Now go, please.

68
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,559
How about dinner at the Imperial Gardens on Wednesday?

69
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:50,559
Okay.

70
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,559
I'll pick you up about 8.30.

71
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,559
Sayonara, Sumi.

72
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,559
Sayonara.

73
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,559
Oyasuminasai.

74
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,559
Oyasuminasai.

75
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,559
Odaiji.

76
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:14,559
Odaiji ni.

77
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:16,559
That's enough.

78
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,559
Mata ashita.

79
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:21,559
Mata ashita.

80
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,559
Goodbye, Robert.

81
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:33,559
Right.

82
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,559
We'll file a report with the provo, Marshal.

83
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:36,559
Thank you very much for the information.

84
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,559
Bye-bye.

85
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,559
All right.

86
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:42,559
How much did you lose?

87
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
I had about 80 bucks worth of yen with me when I started.

88
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
I think I must have had about, oh, 50 left.

89
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,320
We'll write it up as 50.

90
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,320
She got my wallet with my girl's picture.

91
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
That's what hurt, not the dough.

92
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
The old man in?

93
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
Yeah, that reporter Bronson has him cornered.

94
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,320
What are you doing here?

95
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,320
Somebody stole my wallet.

96
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
I should have run you in last night.

97
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,320
All right.

98
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,320
What was her name?

99
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,320
Suzuki?

100
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,320
How'd you know?

101
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,320
Figures.

102
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
That's Smith in Japanese.

103
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,320
All right.

104
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,320
Room 106, down the hall.

105
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,320
Look, I'm not sick.

106
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,320
106, soldier.

107
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
But, Corporal.

108
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,320
Oh.

109
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,320
Oh, no, Corporal.

110
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,320
You don't understand.

111
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
You see, we got...

112
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
106.

113
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,320
And come back tomorrow.

114
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,079
106, and come back and sign this report when you're through.

115
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:52,079
Know anybody named Suzuki, Sarge?

116
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:54,079
They call this a man's army.

117
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,079
Make sure a copy of that report gets to the kid's outfit.

118
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:00,079
A little company punishment will do him some good.

119
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:08,079
Hello, Sarge.

120
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:10,839
I just stopped by for my weekly press releases.

121
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,839
Incidentally, I talked to the Major about the Ginza.

122
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:15,839
He told me you hadn't reported it.

123
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:17,839
Are you going to?

124
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:19,839
I'll write you a letter, Bronson.

125
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:21,839
What makes you so miserable, Douglas?

126
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:23,839
Look, I got a job to do,

127
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:25,839
and I'm doing it the best way I know how.

128
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:27,839
Well, you're a good MP, Sergeant,

129
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:29,839
but you can't clean up Tokyo alone.

130
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:31,839
This is Japan.

131
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:33,839
Why don't you relax and enjoy things?

132
00:15:34,839 --> 00:15:35,839
Live a little.

133
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:36,839
What do you know about Japan, really?

134
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
What, you learn in pachinko parlors,

135
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
beer joints, and geisha houses?

136
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Morning, Major.

137
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
I have three off-limits orders for you to sign, sir.

138
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Anything exceptional?

139
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
No, just the usual.

140
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Two for B-girls, one for serving meth with alcohol.

141
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Ginza?

142
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,600
No, that's the one Bronson was talking about.

143
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
What's the story on this, Bob?

144
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Habitual. Third offense in the last six months.

145
00:16:06,359 --> 00:16:07,359
Nakamura will open up a new location

146
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:09,359
as soon as we close him down.

147
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:11,359
At least we keep him somewhat in line.

148
00:16:12,359 --> 00:16:13,359
How about the monthly activity report?

149
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:15,359
That'll be ready tonight, sir.

150
00:16:16,359 --> 00:16:17,359
How does it look? Any improvement?

151
00:16:18,359 --> 00:16:19,359
A little, but not much, I'm afraid.

152
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:21,359
Kids they send over here getting any younger

153
00:16:22,359 --> 00:16:23,359
will need an MP for every GI.

154
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,359
Can't get that bad.

155
00:16:26,359 --> 00:16:27,359
I just hope my next top kick can maintain your record.

156
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:30,359
Thanks, Major.

157
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:33,359
Well, be sure that that report

158
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,119
gets to Far East Command headquarters tonight, will you?

159
00:16:36,119 --> 00:16:37,119
I'll take it by myself, sir.

160
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:39,119
Well, that won't be necessary.

161
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:41,119
Well, I'm going by headquarters anyway

162
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:43,119
to shop for a gift in Shinjuku.

163
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:45,119
Oh, something special?

164
00:16:46,119 --> 00:16:47,119
Well, sort of. It's a gift for Sumi.

165
00:16:48,119 --> 00:16:49,119
Hey, have you kids set a date yet?

166
00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:51,119
Right after festival week.

167
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:53,119
Oh, fine, fine. Well, best of luck to you.

168
00:16:54,119 --> 00:16:55,119
Thank you, Major.

169
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:57,119
Hey, Bob.

170
00:16:58,119 --> 00:16:59,119
You could probably use a little time before you leave.

171
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,119
Why don't you take some? We'll get along.

172
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:03,119
Thanks. Maybe I will.

173
00:17:03,359 --> 00:17:05,119
Good night.

174
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,119
Good night.

175
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:58,119
Konbanwa. May I help you?

176
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,119
No, thanks. I think I'd just like to look around for a little while.

177
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:02,119
Some coverings?

178
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880
No, no thanks.

179
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,880
Very fine Japanese cigarette lighter.

180
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
Only 1,500 yen?

181
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,880
No.

182
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,880
Very beautiful, is not?

183
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,880
Doll is of the imperial family.

184
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,880
Time of the samurai.

185
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,880
Very great Japanese prince, Hideyoshi.

-3
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
This doll, emperor's daughter.

-2
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
17th century.

-1
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Very beautiful Japanese princess.

0
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
With that hairdo and the obi tied in front?

1
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
More like the emperor's girlfriend, huh?

2
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Forgive me.

3
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
The sergeant is familiar with some of our customs.

4
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I think I'd like to see some fans, please.

5
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Very beautiful Japanese fan.

6
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
No, no, that's not what I'm looking for.

7
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Do you have any others?

8
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Perhaps the sergeant would like one of these.

9
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
No.

10
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
How about the ones in the window?

11
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
My very best Japanese fan.

12
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
How about the ones in the window?

13
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
My very best Japanese fan.

14
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You like?

15
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
How much?

16
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
4,475 yen.

17
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
4,475 yen.

18
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Too much.

19
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'll give you 1,000 yen.

20
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Best price.

21
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
3,975 yen.

22
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Okay?

23
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Deal.

24
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Wrap it up in a nice package, please.

25
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Thank you.

26
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
For a Japanese girl?

27
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
For a Japanese girl.

28
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Not Hideyoshi.

29
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Hideyoshi carried one sword.

30
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Two swords, just plain samurai.

31
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Sayonara.

32
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Sayonara.

33
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Hey, hey.

34
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
What are you doing in there?

35
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Hey, let me go.

36
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Come on out of there.

37
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Come on.

38
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
That's the kid.

39
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Somebody get a doctor.

40
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Don't just stand there.

41
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Get an ambulance.

42
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,000
What I can't understand is why you drew your gun in the first place.

43
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It was instinctive, sir.

44
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I didn't think.

45
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Couldn't you see he was just a kid?

46
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
When I tried to put the gun back, the other boy jarred my arm.

47
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Headquarters is going to love this.

48
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm sorry, sir.

49
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I know it was just an accident.

50
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
But the big brass aren't going to understand.

51
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
We're in Japan as goodwill ambassadors, not just soldiers.

52
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
We can't afford accidents.

53
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I know that, Major.

54
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
There's nothing more we can do about it now.

55
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I hope that boy lives.

56
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Prepare a detailed statement of exactly what happened.

57
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,000
We'll get a report to headquarters before they get it from the Tokyo police.

58
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I'll see to it right away, sir.

59
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And don't leave anything out.

60
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
The smallest detail may prove to be important.

61
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Right.

62
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
One thing more.

63
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Have Williams take your name off the roster.

64
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I don't want you pulling duty for a while.

65
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'll do that, sir.

66
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Excuse me.

67
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Come in.

68
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Do not eat very much.

69
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I'm not very hungry.

70
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
No, no, no.

71
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
You must not blame yourself.

72
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
The other boy caused the accident.

73
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I can still see that kid lying on the street.

74
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
He will recover.

75
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Tokyo Hospital is very good.

76
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Do not worry.

77
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
What do you think?

78
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
A lousy way to end a wonderful three years in Japan.

79
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I feel bad when you say that.

80
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I'm sorry.

81
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I'm afraid I'm not very good company tonight.

82
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You have so much to be happy for.

83
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
So many nice memories and happy times.

84
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
You're right.

85
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
You only see the brightest side.

86
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
No more worries?

87
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
No more.

88
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I brought you something.

89
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Thank you.

90
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You're welcome.

91
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Aren't you going to open it?

92
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
In Japanese, it's bad manners to open presents.

93
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
In American, it's bad manners not to open presents.

94
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Do you like it?

95
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It's beautiful, Robert.

96
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Not a tourist band, but a fine Japanese band.

97
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Pine tree means good fortune and eternal happiness.

98
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
It does, if I don't break it.

99
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Before proceeding to your questions and answers, gentlemen,

100
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I have a brief statement I'd like to make on behalf of the United States government.

101
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
We sincerely regret the unfortunate accident

102
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
that resulted in the death of the Japanese boy Yukio Kojima.

103
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
What does the Army intend to do?

104
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I've assigned Captain House to investigate the matter.

105
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
The Army's course of action will depend on the Captain's final report.

106
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Has Sergeant Douglas been arrested?

107
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
No.

108
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
According to the information available to us at the moment,

109
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
the shooting was an accident.

110
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
And what information is that?

111
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
We have a signed statement by Sergeant Douglas.

112
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
What if the Sergeant's statement is not true?

113
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Mr. Osaka, Sergeant Douglas has been under my command for the past three years.

114
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I have had no occasion whatever to doubt his word.

115
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Major, will Douglas be court-martialed?

116
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
That's quite possible, depending again on the findings of the investigating officer.

117
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Major realizes, of course, that the dead boy was a Japanese national?

118
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Yes.

119
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Does the Major know that our countries have treaty commitments

120
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
placing matters like this under Japanese jurisdiction?

121
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Yes, I'm aware of that.

122
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
The United States-Japan Administrative Agreement

123
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,000
specifically provides for a Japanese jurisdiction in a case like this.

124
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Will you turn Sergeant Douglas over to the Japanese authorities, if requested?

125
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Mr. Osaka, you know very well that's not my decision to make.

126
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
However, I presume the United States will honor all of its treaty commitments.

127
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Major, you mean there's a chance the Army will surrender an American soldier

128
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
to the jurisdiction of a foreign government?

129
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
I'd like to reserve comment on that question, Mr. Bronson,

130
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
until after all of the facts are in.

131
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Well, Major, let me put it this way.

132
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Is there a possibility that Douglas will be turned over to the Japanese?

133
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I have to let my last answer stand, Mr. Bronson, if that's all right with you.

134
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Thank you very much, gentlemen. I think that about covers the matter.

-8
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:44,080
Yes, I checked. The Japanese may request that Douglas be turned over to them.

-7
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,759
Right. No, the Army hasn't done a thing. You know the position they're in.

-6
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:52,000
No, Douglas isn't in custody yet, but the pressure is building.

-5
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:57,759
When this story breaks, it's going to break big. I'll be in touch with you as soon as I've got

-4
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:03,840
anything definite to report. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Goodbye.

-3
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,639
Robert, I came as soon as I could.

-2
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,800
I'm sorry to have you come here, Sumi. The boy died this afternoon.

-1
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:32,080
Yes, I heard. I'd like you to take me to his parents' house. I want to talk to him.

0
00:28:34,639 --> 00:28:35,440
This is the address.

1
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:41,839
You think it is wise for you to go?

2
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:49,279
I want to say I'm sorry. Maybe I can help in some way.

3
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,559
Well, perhaps.

4
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,559
I'd like them to know that I didn't intend to do it. I want them to understand.

5
00:29:00,959 --> 00:29:10,559
All right. I will take you.

6
00:29:49,839 --> 00:30:06,759
by Sugtan

7
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:14,399
Have you seen your family before?

8
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,240
No, I'm here to see an American.

9
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,240
Oh, I see.

10
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,679
Did your father pass away?

11
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:23,399
Mr. Kojima?

12
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,199
I'm sorry for your loss.

13
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:38,119
Thank you very much.

14
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,520
Mr. Kojima, it's Douglas.

15
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:51,119
I'm very sorry for what happened

16
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:52,679
and I want to help.

17
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:57,240
The Americans are deeply sorry about this trip.

18
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,080
If there’s anything we can do...

19
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:01,759
What can Americans do?

20
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:04,000
Our child won't come back.

21
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,119
What are you saying?

22
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,639
Mr. Kojima is very troubled.

23
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:16,119
At least maybe I can help with some of the expenses.

24
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,839
No, Robert, do not.

25
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:18,839
Please.

26
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,839
He truly wants to do something to help.

27
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,359
We don’t want American money.

28
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,480
We want our child back.

29
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:29,880
I was just trying to help.

30
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,920
Robert, we have to go.

31
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,920
What are you saying?

32
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,720
More than your American money, we want our son.

33
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,359
I thought it was the right thing to do.

34
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,160
For Japanese people, it's a traditional sentiment.

35
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,600
What about my money?

36
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:51,839
I’m trying to get our son back.

37
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,640
He will not accept it.

38
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,559
Because I’m American?

39
00:31:58,239 --> 00:32:02,519
Mr. Kojima is overwhelmed with sorrow.

40
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,959
It would be better if you would leave.

41
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,040
It was an accident.

42
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,160
Can’t you understand their feelings?

43
00:32:18,239 --> 00:32:20,160
They suffered a great loss.

44
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:22,359
To understand their emotions...

45
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,760
Excuse me.

46
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,720
American murderer!

47
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:50,320
Filthy American!

48
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,000
Please go away.

49
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,880
You're disrespecting Japan.

50
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:09,959
Please leave this place.

51
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,600
I'll take him to my father’s house.

52
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:14,119
Thank you for your help.

53
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,000
First of September.

54
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:39,320
Tsumisan.

55
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,880
Where’s your mother?

56
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,160
Good morning.

57
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:45,640
What is it?

58
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:47,359
The stone is standing.

59
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,200
Bring the medicine.

60
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:51,399
Tell Mom it's okay.

61
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,720
It’s already alright.

62
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:53,959
Here you go.

63
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,839
I'm home.

64
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,079
Welcome back.

65
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,640
Good evening.

66
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Tsumichan, you’ve grown.

67
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:19,320
You’ve gotten better.

68
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:20,959
That’s nice.

69
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,119
Did I do well?

70
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,119
You’re really kind.

71
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:31,880
Very smart.

72
00:34:37,799 --> 00:34:39,279
Thank you.

73
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,160
Being too smart is bad, they say.

74
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,839
Don’t you know how to smile?

75
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,279
What’s wrong?

76
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,279
I won’t smile at a murderer like an American.

77
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:00,239
What are you saying? To our guest?

78
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,359
I don't like her.

79
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:05,760
Big brother likes to joke.

80
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,119
She’s not my guest.

88
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:17,519
Enough already.

89
00:35:45,919 --> 00:35:47,919
Her death was an accident.

90
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,840
If someone had taken responsibility, her friend would've been there.

91
00:35:50,919 --> 00:35:52,919
This is not about another man.

92
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:55,599
What are you saying?

93
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:57,479
It’s written in the newspaper.

94
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:00,280
It says she deliberately killed Yukiyo Kojima.

95
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:01,760
That's not a lie.

96
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,000
She is lying.

97
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,280
It’s not a lie.

98
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,599
Look at this.

99
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:13,039
I can’t read Japanese, I don’t know what it says.

100
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:15,599
Find that girl and tell the truth.

101
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:18,359
Robert, tell them.

102
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,039
Don’t you dislike her?

103
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,840
What’s life like for a Japanese man like him?

104
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:25,719
And for other Americans?

105
00:36:25,799 --> 00:36:28,119
You can’t believe that, can you, Toshio?

106
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:32,479
Sumi, do you think I could kill someone cold-bloodedly?


-5
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,700
Do you think I could kill anyone in cold blood, a Japanese boy or anyone else?

-4
00:36:37,799 --> 00:36:39,799
I do not know what to believe.

-3
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,599
If I were Japanese, you'd know what to believe, wouldn't you?

-2
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,000
I did not mean it that way.

-1
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:45,599
Neither did the fellow who threw this rock.

0
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,200
That's not fair. You twist my words.

1
00:36:47,299 --> 00:36:50,799
I'm not twisting anything, but you're willing to take this kid's word over mine and make me the liar.

2
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,299
That is not true. You're not giving me time to think.

3
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,799
Well, I'll give you plenty of time to think.

4
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
I... I'd better be going.

5
00:37:01,299 --> 00:37:02,799
Robert, please.

6
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,800
Oh, yasuminasai.

7
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:16,599
Major, I want action on this immediately.

8
00:37:16,699 --> 00:37:19,800
No coddling, no butt-passing. Get it done and get it done at once.

9
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,000
I understand, sir. Captain House's report will be on your desk this afternoon.

10
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:24,800
That won't be good enough.

11
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,000
It's following procedure according to Army regulations.

12
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,400
Let me worry about the regulations.

13
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,400
Sir, a soldier's career may be at stake.

14
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,699
More than that may be lost if we foul up this case.

15
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,699
Your sergeant's career is not very important in the overall picture.

16
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,199
I don't intend to see him railroaded, but we can't cover up for him either.

17
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,800
By that, you mean Sergeant Douglas may have to stand court-martial.

18
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:50,900
There's always a chance the Japanese may insist upon his being turned over to them for trial.

19
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:54,800
I'll start proceedings for a court-martial at once.

20
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,599
Will that be all, sir?

21
00:37:56,699 --> 00:37:58,400
That's all for now.

22
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,500
I'm sure everything in this report is correct.

23
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:08,800
It happened pretty fast, but I think it's all there.

24
00:38:08,899 --> 00:38:11,699
Because, you know, the other boy says he never touched your arm.

25
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,600
He claims you fired without warning and without provocation.

26
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:17,000
He's lying, Major.

27
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,699
It shouldn't be too difficult to break a story down in court.

28
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:23,199
Incidentally, you know, you have the right to choose counsel.

29
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:27,000
Sir, I've heard rumors that the Japanese may want jurisdiction over me.

30
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:30,000
To be quite frankly, there is that chance.

31
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,100
I think they'll be satisfied with a court-martial.

32
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:35,600
If it should come down to my word against the boys, I'd hate to have them decide.

33
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:37,600
I understand their courts are pretty fair.

34
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:39,100
That may be so.

35
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:42,199
But here's one soldier that would be happy with a court-martial.

36
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:46,199
Well, we'll see.

37
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,699
Is that it, sir?

38
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,800
Except that you understand that now you're restricted to quarters.

39
00:38:50,899 --> 00:38:52,800
Yes, sir.

40
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,500
I'm sorry about this, Bob.

41
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,600
But we'll clear it up just as quickly as we can.

42
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,800
Yes, they decided to let the Japanese try, Douglas.

43
00:39:14,899 --> 00:39:19,600
No, it's not official yet, but I got it from a well-placed source in Far East Command headquarters.

44
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:22,500
Get your soft sisters out. Play the human interest angle up big.

45
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,899
His mother, his friends, hometown.

46
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,800
Light a bonfire under his congressmen and senators. That'll get the ball rolling.

47
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:31,899
And keep a line open for me. This is hot.

48
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Right. Bye-bye.

49
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Come on in.

50
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
How'd you get up here?

51
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:11,100
An off-the-record visit. I told the CQ it was personal.

52
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:14,199
What could be personal between you and me?

53
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,799
Look, Douglas, I, uh...

54
00:40:16,899 --> 00:40:18,899
I really want to help you.

55
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:21,299
I really want to help you.

56
00:40:23,299 --> 00:40:25,299
What makes you think I need any?

57
00:40:25,399 --> 00:40:27,299
Don't you get the picture, kid?

58
00:40:27,399 --> 00:40:29,299
If the Army goes ahead with this, you're in serious trouble.

59
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:33,399
They have to find you guilty. They have to appease Japanese public opinion.

60
00:40:37,799 --> 00:40:41,799
I don't believe that. Believe what you want. I'm giving it to you straight.

61
00:40:42,299 --> 00:40:44,299
You'll be lucky to get off with only a court-martial.

62
00:40:44,399 --> 00:40:47,399
Right now, you're headed for a Japanese trial.

63
00:40:49,299 --> 00:40:51,299
The Army wouldn't do that.

64
00:40:52,799 --> 00:40:54,799
Wait and see.

65
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:04,799
How do you think your story will stand up against that kid's and their courts?

66
00:41:10,799 --> 00:41:13,799
What's your angle, Bronson? What do you want?

67
00:41:13,899 --> 00:41:16,899
Well, maybe I've cut a few corners in my time.

68
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Some, I admit, were shaved pretty close for the story, but...

69
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,100
that's all part of being a reporter.

70
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,200
Sure, I've wrapped the Army when I thought they had it coming.

71
00:41:26,299 --> 00:41:30,299
But only to prove to the brass that the Army wasn't their own private little club.

72
00:41:35,299 --> 00:41:38,299
You haven't answered my question. What's in it for you?

73
00:41:40,299 --> 00:41:43,299
Okay. I want a story.

74
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,700
But there's something a lot bigger than that involved.

75
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,700
The American eagle used to scream every time an American was in trouble.

76
00:41:51,799 --> 00:41:55,799
Now it buries its head in the sand like an ostrich and pretends it doesn't see.

77
00:41:56,799 --> 00:42:00,799
But it can still hear. And I intend to make it sit up and listen.

78
00:42:00,899 --> 00:42:02,899
Just what do you want me to do?

79
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Don't let him push you around. Let me get a good lawyer to handle your case.

80
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:09,100
You're going to need outside help.

81
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:12,100
I'll take my chances with the Army.

82
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,200
They've always given me a fair shake.

83
00:42:17,299 --> 00:42:20,299
Okay, Douglas. Okay.

84
00:42:20,399 --> 00:42:24,399
I can see you now rotting in some stinking Japanese prison.

85
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:34,100
If you change your mind, you know where you can get in touch with me.

86
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,200
Thanks.

87
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,100
I'll see you later.

88
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,200
Sumi is calling again. You want to talk to her?

89
00:43:04,299 --> 00:43:07,299
No. Tell her I'm still busy.

90
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,200
Hi.

91
00:43:11,299 --> 00:43:13,299
You better pack your gear.

92
00:43:13,399 --> 00:43:15,399
What's up?

93
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,500
I have to deliver you to Camp Zama.

94
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,600
Camp Zama? What for?

95
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:27,700
I'm not sure, but the scuttlebutt has it you're to be turned over to the Japanese for trial.

96
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,700
I must have been in Japan longer than I thought.

97
00:43:42,799 --> 00:43:44,799
I'm beginning to enjoy this music.

98
00:43:44,899 --> 00:43:47,899
Yeah, it sure has a beat.

99
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Makes you feel like dancing.

100
00:44:39,099 --> 00:44:41,099
I'll see you later.

101
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,200
This is no time to worry about whose fault it is.

102
00:45:03,299 --> 00:45:05,299
I didn't expect Douglas to take off.

103
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,400
You get every available man out looking for him.

104
00:45:08,799 --> 00:45:10,799
Turn the Ginza inside out if you have to, but find him.

105
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:11,900
Yes, sir.

106
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Tell the men to keep it quiet. Dismissed.

107
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:16,099
Right, sir.

108
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,700
Pardon me, Major.

109
00:45:20,799 --> 00:45:22,799
What do you want?

110
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,900
There's a Sumi Fujita outside. She wants to see Sergeant Douglas.

111
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,900
Show her in. She may help.

-1
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,500
This way, please.

0
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,500
Ms. Fujita, come in.

1
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,000
I'm Major Bradley. I'm Douglas' commanding officer.

2
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
What can I do for you?

3
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,500
I would like to speak with Sergeant Douglas.

4
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,500
Why did you speak with him last?

5
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,000
Not for two days.

6
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
You didn't talk to him today at all?

7
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,500
No. Is something wrong?

8
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,000
What has happened?

9
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,500
Sit down, won't you, Ms. Fujita?

10
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,000
You know about the death of the boy.

11
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,500
You know how delicate and sensitive this situation has become.

12
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
The friendship, the goodwill between Japan and the United States...

13
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,500
may very well depend on how we handle the situation.

14
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,000
That's why I'm going to take a chance in confiding you...

15
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,500
in the hope that you may be able to help us and Sergeant Douglas.

16
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:31,500
I will do anything to help Robert.

17
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,000
You probably heard on the radio...

18
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,500
we were planning to transfer Douglas to Japanese authority.

19
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,500
About an hour ago, he broke restriction.

20
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,500
He struck a guard and disappeared.

21
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,500
It is all my fault.

22
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,500
Why do you say that?

23
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:48,500
When all this trouble happened...

24
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,500
he asked for my understanding, but I doubted him.

25
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,500
If I, who was closest to him, did not have faith...

26
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,500
what hope could he have in others?

27
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,500
I imagine he feels the army has let him down, too.

28
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,500
In a way, I can understand that.

29
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,500
He must be made to realize that isn't true.

30
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,500
He'll probably try to contact you.

31
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,500
I'd like you to phone me when that happens.

32
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,500
You ask very much.

33
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,500
Well, his running away is no solution.

34
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,500
It only makes things worse.

35
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,500
He must come back. It's best for him.

36
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,500
You would not hurt him?

37
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,500
I'd give him my word.

38
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,500
I will call you.

39
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,500
Thank you.

40
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,500
Goodbye, Major.

41
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,500
Goodbye.

42
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,500
Miss Fujita...

43
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,500
I think Sergeant Douglas is a lucky man.

44
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,500
Kobawa.

45
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,500
So you remember me, huh?

46
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,500
Now, take it easy, sonny.

47
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,500
I just want to talk to you.

48
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,500
Nobody's going to hurt you.

49
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:17,500
I just want you to tell the truth about what happened.

50
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,500
There's nothing to be afraid of, but you must tell the truth.

51
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,500
Do you understand?

52
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,500
Yes, sir.

53
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,500
Now, look, I heard you speak English, so let's cut the wakarimasen.

54
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,500
I know you understand.

55
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:30,500
Now, you've got to tell him it was an accident, that you hit the garden.

56
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,500
You lie! You lie!

57
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,500
You're going to tell the truth, or I'll...

58
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,500
I did not do it! I did not do it!

59
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,500
What's the use?

60
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,500
Robert.

61
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:50,500
How did you know where to find me?

62
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,500
When I heard you ran away,

63
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,500
I thought you would come here to talk to the boy first.

64
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,500
Why, when you were so sure he was telling the truth?

65
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,500
I'm sorry for what happened.

66
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,500
I believe in you. I do.

67
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,500
Maybe we were both a little too quick.

68
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,500
They're searching all over for you.

69
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,500
You must go back.

70
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,500
What good will that do?

71
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,500
That kid won't change his story.

72
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,500
He's too frightened.

73
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,500
This is not the way.

74
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,500
The police will know what to do.

75
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,500
And if they don't?

76
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:35,500
Running away will not help.

77
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,500
Where will you go?

78
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:39,500
I don't know.

79
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,500
Alone, you will not be able to hide for a day in Tokyo.

80
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,500
That's a chance I'll have to take.

81
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,500
Robert, you have to let me help you.

82
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,500
I don't want you to get mixed up in this.

83
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:00,500
Please, I can take you to my teacher's house.

84
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,500
They will not look for you there.

85
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,500
No one will know.

86
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,500
Your teacher won't want me at his house.

87
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,500
Sensei will do it for me.

88
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,500
Come.

89
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,500
It will give us time to think about what to do.

90
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,500
Sumi, I...

91
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,500
Don't say anything.

92
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,500
Sorry I'm late, gentlemen.

93
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,500
I was with the foreign minister for the past two hours.

94
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,500
Mr. Johnson, this is Major Bradley.

95
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,500
How do you do, Major.

96
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,500
What attitude is the government taking?

97
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,500
They want Douglas.

98
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,500
The local press has been crawling with anti-American propaganda.

99
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,500
The pressure on the government is tremendous.

100
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:57,500
They won't be able to delay a showdown on the issue in the diet much longer.

101
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,500
Have your men located Douglas?

102
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,500
No, we haven't.

103
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,500
Major Bradley has been in contact with Douglas' girl.

104
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:07,500
We feel sure he'll try to see her before long.

105
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,500
And when he does, we'll be waiting.

106
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,500
Not very encouraging, General.

107
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:19,500
At the very most, I figure we can stall for about 48 hours, but not more.

108
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:23,500
Before we'll have to notify the Japanese authorities that we allowed Douglas to escape.

109
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:27,500
I beg your pardon, sir. We didn't allow him to escape.

110
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,500
An unfortunate choice of words.

111
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,500
I didn't intend to imply negligence on your part.

112
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:39,500
However, there are certain extremists who would like to have the Japanese people believe that it wasn't negligence, but even deliberate.

113
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,500
We're doing everything in our power.

114
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:46,500
Without some kind of positive lead, frankly, I'm doubtful of our chance of locating Douglas, even within 48 hours.

115
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,500
Tokyo is a big city.

116
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:50,500
A lot of places he could be hiding.

117
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,500
Eventually, of course, he's got to turn up.

118
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:56,500
Major, we're not dealing in eventualities.

119
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:00,500
In the language of diplomacy, it's imperative.

120
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,500
Gentlemen, my men and I will stick with this around the clock.

121
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,500
Doctor, are you in?

122
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,500
Good evening, Doctor.

123
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:34,500
Sumi-chan, come in.

124
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,500
Who is it?

125
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,500
I'd be most happy to speak in English.

126
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,500
Who is our guest?

127
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:53,500
Sensei, I would like you to meet my friend, Sergeant Robert Douglas.

128
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,500
Forgive me if I cannot prove you the formal duties of a host.

129
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,500
Please, sir. I'm very happy to know you.

130
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:08,500
The sergeant finds himself in difficulty and needs a place to stay a few days.

131
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:12,500
If it is not too great a burden, may he stay with you?

132
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,500
My house is a large one.

133
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:20,500
It will be my pleasure to have Sumi's friend remain as my guest for as long as he wishes.

134
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,500
Thank you. You are most kind.

135
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,500
I must hurry to the Ginza for my last show.

136
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,500
Sensei's playing of the koto is known everywhere in Japan.

137
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,500
Perhaps he will play for you until I return.

138
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,500
You flatter my humble talent.

139
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:40,500
But I fear the music of the koto is not for Western ears.

140
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,500
No, please. I would like very much to hear you play.

141
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,500
Sensei, goodbye.

142
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,500
I'll come back as soon as I can.

143
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,500
Thank you for your visit.

144
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:07,500
Come on, come on.

145
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:12,500
Shut up. No, no.

146
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,500
I'm happy. I won, I won. I'm very happy.

147
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,500
Good evening, Miss Fujita.

148
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,500
Thank you, Major Bradley.

149
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:25,500
Forgive me for asking you to come here, but I could not leave.

150
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:30,500
I'm happy to see the Ginza. It's been known to me, but only on paper.

-9
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Please sit down. May I have a drink brought to you?

-8
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
No, thanks.

-7
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
You heard from him?

-6
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I must speak to you first. Certainly.

-5
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
In your office I said I would tell you if I saw Sergeant Douglas.

-4
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I'm ashamed, but I cannot do it.

-3
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
But then you've seen him. Where is he? Where's he hiding?

-2
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Please, Major Bradley, I've tried to think of what is the right thing to do.

-1
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Douglas has to give himself up.

0
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Perhaps it is best that he gives himself up to the infuse.

1
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
I do not know. Robert must decide for himself.

2
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,000
You would be helping him.

3
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Perhaps an American girl would do it your way.

4
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I must do it my way. I know he will do right.

5
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Suppose it's foolish of me to try to balance my logic against the feeling of your heart.

6
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
If you would just let me see him.

7
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
You know I want Douglas to turn himself in. I want to help him personally.

8
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
And I can. Believe me.

9
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I believe you, but there is nothing I can do.

10
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Let me talk to him just for a few minutes.

11
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
I'm sure I can convince him of the right course to take.

12
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
If he were to meet you, would you be alone?

13
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I don't have the right to do it, but...

14
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
Okay. Just myself.

15
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
You will be alone.

16
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,000
There'll be no one else.

17
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
Then be at the Koyasan Temple tomorrow night at 9 o'clock.

18
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
No one will see us there.

19
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I cannot promise, but I will try to bring Robert.

20
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Thank you, Miss Fujii.

21
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Incidentally, what is this that you've been making?

22
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Atsuru.

23
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,000
For Japanese, it means good luck.

24
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Hello, Major.

25
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Sumi.

26
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Bronson.

27
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Nice to see you in the Ginza.

28
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
I heard so much about Sumi's beauty, I had to see for myself.

29
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Thank you.

30
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I must dress now. Please excuse me.

31
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
I was told that you visited Douglas in his quarters.

32
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
CQ let me in.

33
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
What did you talk about?

34
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I don't have to answer your question, Major,

35
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
but I will.

36
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,000
We talked about Americans who get in trouble away from home.

37
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Bronson, I hope you understand the difference

38
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,000
between freedom of the press and irresponsibility.

39
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
THE END

40
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
THE END

41
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
The garden is so peaceful at night.

42
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
I didn't even hear you come in.

43
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
We say the troubles of the day disappear in the serenity of the garden.

44
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,000
And we say a man's troubles disappear in the arms of the woman he loves.

45
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I missed you, Sumi.

46
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Robert, there's something I want to talk about.

47
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
All right. Am I intruding?

48
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Where did you come from?

49
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
The instinct of an old newsman.

50
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I saw Sumi with the Major and I thought I'd tag along.

51
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
The Major?

52
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,000
I tried to tell you.

53
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
We'll talk about it later.

54
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
All right, Bronson. Now that you know, what are you going to do?

55
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
You got me all wrong. I'm not going to turn you in.

56
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I still want to help.

57
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Now that everything has happened that I said would happen,

58
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
for a change, listen to reason.

59
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Okay, so you were right. But I still don't think you can help me.

60
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I can do more than you think.

61
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Like what, for instance?

62
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
When I get through with you, they won't dare turn you over.

63
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
That sounds great, but I can't hide out in Japan forever, you know.

64
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
That's the best part of it. I'll get you back to the States.

65
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
The States? What good would that do?

66
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
They'd ship me back here the minute I got there.

67
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,000
When I finish, there'll be 170 million Americans behind you.

68
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
We'll start a fire under Congress.

69
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Take it to the Supreme Court if we have to.

70
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Just how would you get me out of Japan?

71
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Leave it to me. I'll get you to Frisco and surrender you there.

72
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
They won't dare bring you back for trial.

73
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Are you game?

74
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I'm probably a fool for even listening to you.

75
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
I know it'll work.

76
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
You just have to give me your word.

77
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I'll have to think it over.

78
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I'll have to think it over.

79
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,000
Don't take too long.

80
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I'll let you know tomorrow.

81
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Good. You won't regret it.

82
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Good night, Suli.

83
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
I will see you to the gate.

84
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
No, thank you. I'll go the way I came.

85
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
What were you doing with the Major?

86
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I tried to tell you before.

87
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
The Major wants to talk with you.

88
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
I'm sure he would.

89
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
He and a couple of hundred MPs.

90
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
No, Robert, please. He will meet you alone, in secret.

91
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
What for?

92
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
He said he wants to help you.

93
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
It's too late for him to do anything for me now.

94
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
He has to look out for his own neck.

95
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:03,000
If you at least talk with the Major, maybe you won't have to run away.

96
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
I tell you, it won't do any good.

97
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Please try it.

98
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
For me.

99
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:15,000
All right.

100
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
All right, I'll try.

101
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Douglas?

102
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Is that you?

103
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Douglas, are you here?

104
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
It's Sumi, Major.

105
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
I'm alone. Nobody else is here.

106
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Here I am, Major.

107
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Hello, Sergeant.

108
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Hello, Sergeant.

109
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Sumi said you wanted to talk.

110
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Yes.

111
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I was wondering if I could get you to see the whole picture.

112
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
I'm not interested in the whole picture.

113
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I'm looking out for myself.

114
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:28,000
The day you signed up for the army, you gave up the luxury of looking out for yourself.

115
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
That's right, Major, but I enlisted in the American army, not the Japanese.

116
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Still, the American army is giving you orders.

117
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
And will it be an American or a Japanese prison?

118
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Frankly, I doubt it'll be either.

119
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:41,000
I find the Japanese are just as fair as any American court, but that's beside the point, Sergeant.

120
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
You don't have a choice.

121
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
You've been ordered to stand trial.

122
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
And for the first time, I'm going to disobey an order.

123
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
We'll catch you.

124
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
You know that.

125
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Then you'll stand a court-martial as well as a Japanese trial.

126
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
You can't get away with it.

127
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Maybe not, but I'm going to try.

128
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Let me speak to you honestly.

129
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,000
As an army officer, sure, I'd like to see your surrender.

130
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
I'd like to see this whole affair ended with no more publicity.

131
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
And just as honestly, I'd like to get you out of this mess.

132
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
The least possible injury to you.

133
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
But that means you've got to face the issue squarely and directly.

134
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
You can't run from it.

135
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
I don't see it that way.

136
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I've got other plans.

0
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Sergeant, I want you to come back with me now.

1
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
That's an order.

2
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
I came here on your word, Major.

3
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Don't force me to do something we'll both regret.

4
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
If you don't turn yourself in, there's not a thing I can do for you.

5
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:50,000
I'll take my chances.

6
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
You don't leave me much choice.

7
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
I'll give you 24 hours more.

8
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
24 hours more.

9
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Tomorrow night, I'm informing the Japanese authorities...

10
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
that they'll use any means necessary to bring you in.

11
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Dead or alive.

12
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Sumi will stay with you until I'm away from the temple.

13
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Goodbye, Major.

14
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Now, I said we'd do it.

15
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Headlines all over the country.

16
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Congress screaming for an investigation.

17
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
The American Legion demanding your release.

18
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
We're in.

19
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,000
It's bigger than I thought.

20
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:44,000
There was a mass protest meeting in Springfield.

21
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Even your mother was on TV.

22
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Did you have to bring her into this?

23
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Relax. Nobody's getting hurt.

24
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
Let me handle this.

25
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
You have every mother in America praying for you.

26
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,000
All right, all right. Handle it your own way.

27
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,000
When do Sumi and I leave?

28
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Sumi can't go. I thought you understood.

29
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
What do you mean? If she doesn't go, I don't.

30
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Wait a minute. Be reasonable. There's such a thing as a passport.

31
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Then get her one.

32
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
We haven't got time.

33
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Trying to get a passport for Sumi now would be a dead giveaway.

34
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Okay, Bronson. The deal is off.

35
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Look, if you leave as arranged,

36
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,000
after we spring the surprise, I'll have Sumi sent over.

37
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
It won't be more than a few weeks.

38
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Why, you could even be married over there.

39
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Better yet, I'll arrange a wedding in San Francisco.

40
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
I don't know.

41
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,000
How does that sound to you?

42
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Whatever you think is best.

43
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
You better not let me down, Bronson.

44
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Don't worry, kid. I won't.

45
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Okay, when do I leave?

46
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
You ship out on a freighter tomorrow night.

47
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I'm getting Seaman's papers.

48
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
I'll pick you up in town around 10 o'clock.

49
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
We'll drive down to Yokohama together.

50
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
When will we meet him?

51
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I cannot be with you.

52
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
I must stay at the Ginza.

53
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
If I'm not there, they may suspect.

54
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I'll meet you at the Ginza.

55
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
Robert, it is dangerous.

56
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
The MPs have been watching the Ginza.

57
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
She's right. The Ginza may be too hard for you.

58
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,000
No, no, it's the last place they'd look for me.

59
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I'll sneak into Sumi's dressing room through a door in the rear.

60
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,000
Nobody will see me there.

61
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,000
You know the MPs better than I do.

62
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Well, I'd better get going.

63
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I'll see you to the door.

64
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Sumi, take care of him.

65
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,000
He's valuable property.

66
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,000
I'll see you tomorrow, kid.

67
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
It won't be for long.

68
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Hey, hey, what's this?

69
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Come on, get up.

70
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
I'm trying to be brave.

71
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:27,000
But I'm so afraid you'll go to America and we'll never see each other again.

72
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Oh, darling, that's not true.

73
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
We'll be together in two weeks.

74
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I love you so much.

75
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I don't want to live without you.

76
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,000
I love you.

77
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Good morning.

78
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
Good morning.

79
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,000
I made you coffee, American style.

80
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Thank you.

81
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:55,000
You do not like how I make coffee?

82
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Oh, no, no, it's fine, honestly.

83
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
No.

84
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I'll be the luckiest man in the whole United States.

85
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Will they like me in Springfield, Illinois?

86
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:23,000
They won't like you. They'll love you.

87
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Is it cold there?

88
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Well, I guess it's about the same as it is here.

89
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Maybe a little hotter than summertime.

90
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
No cherry blossoms.

91
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Will we have a house of our own?

92
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,000
You bet we will.

93
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Two bedrooms and a den.

94
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Bath and three quarters.

95
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,000
And no doubt, David, you'll love it.

96
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I will love what you love.

97
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Robert, if we cannot be together,

98
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I will not be sorry.

99
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,000
I'm grateful for the happiness we shared.

100
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Suzie, don't talk like that.

101
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Everything is going to work out.

102
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:22,000
I heard many soldiers were ashamed to their Japanese brides in America.

103
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
So be it.

104
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Robert, please, promise to tell me when you no longer love me.

105
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I'll always love you.

109
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Forgive me, sensei. I did not wish to disturb you.

110
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,000
The sergeant has listened to more than enough koto for one day.

111
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I've enjoyed your playing very much.

112
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,000
You are too kind.

113
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:34,000
You have been most generous. Thank you for your kindness.

114
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Goodbye.

115
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
It has been my pleasure.

116
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Goodbye.

117
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Goodbye.

118
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,000
See you at the Ginza.

119
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I'll be happy to help.

120
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:02,000
I'll see you again later at the Ginza.

121
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Please be careful.

122
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Thank you.

123
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,000
Will you join me in a cup of tea?

124
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Thank you, Sensei.

125
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Our tea is perhaps a little too bitter for your American taste.

126
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:26,000
No, I've become accustomed to it.

127
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,000
To us, it is a symbol of the bitterness of life in our poor country.

-6
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,520
than the taste.

-5
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:43,680
It is part of the Japanese character to try and see beauty in that which might be considered

-4
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:46,000
ugly and unpleasant.

-3
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:51,119
I've seen a tea ceremony performed many times, but frankly I never knew what it was all about.

-2
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:52,959
You are honest.

-1
01:12:52,959 --> 01:12:57,880
Most Westerners wish so anxiously to see the beauty of Japanese customs that they believe

0
01:12:57,880 --> 01:12:59,279
they do.

1
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:03,599
But it is more than seeing.

2
01:13:03,599 --> 01:13:12,400
Our ceremonies, our music, our kabuki, are the products of our own culture.

3
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:17,120
One has to be Japanese to understand and appreciate their beauty.

4
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:21,800
Do you really believe that we're so different?

5
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:24,720
Of course we are different.

6
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:29,120
Even you understand that.

7
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:31,639
What do you mean?

8
01:13:31,639 --> 01:13:35,639
Your present troubles.

9
01:13:35,639 --> 01:13:44,120
You know about that.

10
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:47,720
A blind man learns to see without his eyes.

11
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:51,639
I don't think my present troubles have anything to do with understanding the Japanese.

12
01:13:51,639 --> 01:13:54,760
Forgive me, Sergeant.

13
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:58,120
I do not wish to offend you.

14
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:03,279
I've traveled all over Japan, been here for three years, spoken to all kinds of people.

15
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:04,559
Spoken?

16
01:14:04,559 --> 01:14:11,360
And how many of those people were able to express themselves in modern pidgin English?

17
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:19,039
The barrier of language prevented them from saying one-tenth of what they were thinking.

18
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:28,919
And so, like with many Americans, a true understanding never developed.

19
01:14:28,919 --> 01:14:30,720
Sumi and I have learned to understand each other.

20
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:35,160
You have learned how to love each other.

21
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:40,080
But have you learned to understand?

22
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:43,000
I don't follow.

23
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:48,679
Have you considered what Sumi is giving up to go with you to America?

24
01:14:48,679 --> 01:14:54,880
Her parents, her friends, her career, her whole way of life?

25
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:56,399
We've talked about it.

26
01:14:56,399 --> 01:14:57,399
She's willing.

27
01:14:57,399 --> 01:15:02,679
You have no doubt, told her, that the color of her skin will make no difference in America?

28
01:15:02,679 --> 01:15:03,839
It won't.

29
01:15:03,839 --> 01:15:11,639
You expect Sumi to accept your customs, your laws, and submit to your justice, and yet...

30
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:13,679
That's not a just comparison.

31
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:15,679
Isn't it?

32
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:16,679
No.

33
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:23,679
Then why are you running?

34
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:25,720
Because I'm not getting a fair deal.

35
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:26,720
Be honest with yourself.

36
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:30,279
That is not the reason.

37
01:15:30,279 --> 01:15:34,880
You are running away because it is not an American, but a Japanese who will pass judgment

38
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:35,880
on you.

39
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:37,800
And what would you have me do, give myself up?

40
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:38,800
Is that the only answer?

41
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,240
Well, I don't see it.

42
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:44,759
Riding in some prison won't do Sumi or me any good.

43
01:15:44,759 --> 01:15:52,240
I am afraid I am spoiling your last memories of Japan.

44
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,240
Forgive an old fool.

45
01:16:11,240 --> 01:16:30,880
You took a long enough time getting here.

46
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:33,480
The streets are crawling with M.P.'s.

47
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:34,480
I had to be careful.

48
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:36,559
You're the one who wanted to meet here.

49
01:16:36,559 --> 01:16:38,320
Any other place would have been better.

50
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,320
Stop beefing, will you, Bronson?

51
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,320
Where's Sumi?

52
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,320
We haven't got time for Sumi.

53
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,320
I have to get you to that pier by 11 o'clock.

54
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:43,320
Here are your sealant papers.

55
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,320
Your name is George Kowalski.

56
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,320
Now let's get going.

57
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:46,320
We'll wait for Sumi.

58
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:47,320
Don't be a fool, Bob.

59
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:48,320
I said we'll wait, Bronson.

60
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,320
We haven't got all night.

61
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,320
I'll be right back.

62
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,320
But...

63
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:35,320
Robert, the M.P.'s will see you.

64
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:38,320
No, they won't.

65
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:41,320
I'll be gone in just a second.

66
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:42,320
I'm so afraid.

67
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,320
Let's get moving.

68
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:44,320
Sumi, I...

69
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,320
I know.

70
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,320
Now, Bronson will make all the arrangements for you.

71
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:47,320
I love you.

72
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:48,320
I love you.

73
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,320
Please go, Robert.

74
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:50,320
You don't want to...

75
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,320
You don't remember me like this.

76
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:52,320
Sumi, you're talking like you're not going to come to me.

77
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:53,320
You will, won't you?

78
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,320
Please, Robert.

79
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,320
Everything is so confused.

80
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,320
You want me to stay and face it, don't you?

81
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,320
Don't you?

82
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:58,320
I cannot tell you what to do.

83
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:59,320
You must decide for both of us.

84
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:00,320
There's no more time for talk.

85
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:01,320
Shut up, will you?

86
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:02,320
If we don't leave now, our whole plan goes up in smoke.

98
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:14,320
You can't change your mind.

99
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,320
I just did.

100
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,320
Okay.

101
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,320
Okay, soldier.

102
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:18,320
It'll make a good story either way.

103
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:21,320
You got me.

104
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:35,320
I'll go back to the station.

105
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:50,320
You know what was right all along, didn't you?

106
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:53,320
No, Robert.

107
01:19:53,320 --> 01:20:07,320
You did.

108
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:10,320
You won't be afraid.
