1
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,051
Eleven o'clock.

2
00:01:58,075 --> 00:02:00,035
I didn't know it was so late.

3
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:07,751
Goodnight.

4
00:02:07,793 --> 00:02:09,503
Goodnight, dear.

5
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,015
Oh, Bob!

6
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,103
You've got my gloves.

7
00:02:27,688 --> 00:02:30,899
That's funny, there's a pair of gloves
in my pocket.

8
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:32,776
Are these yours?

9
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,030
Let me put them on for you.

10
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,829
Bob, I really must go now.

11
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,709
Goodnight.

12
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:53,251
And, honey, you will be on time
tomorrow night, won't you?

13
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:55,859
You were late tonight
and I was worried.

14
00:02:55,883 --> 00:02:58,510
I'll try awfully hard, Bob.

15
00:03:16,862 --> 00:03:19,865
Just drive down the street a bit,
I'll tell you where to go later.

16
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:26,830
I'll tell you where to go right now.

17
00:03:26,872 --> 00:03:28,832
Police headquarters.

18
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,770
Go on, get up there.

19
00:03:56,026 --> 00:03:58,570
Well, well, well, if it isn't Ritzie.

20
00:03:58,612 --> 00:04:01,281
This is indeed an honor and a pleasure.

21
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,370
It takes so little to give some
people pleasure, doesn't it?

22
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,247
Where's Thunderbolt?

23
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,541
- Who?
- Don't try any of that stuff on me.

24
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,293
You know who I mean.

25
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:13,974
In case your memory
has suddenly left you,

26
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,149
let me remind you of Jim Lang,
sometimes called Jim Carson,

27
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,277
sometimes called... well, sometimes
called anything in the world

28
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,678
but always known as Thunderbolt.

29
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,619
I suppose that you've never even heard
of the Hellinger case.

30
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:32,228
Or the million-dollar
St. Louis Terminal job.

31
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:36,813
Or the time that he held up
the Iroquois Bank single-handed.

32
00:04:36,984 --> 00:04:40,404
He's wanted right now by nine states
for bank robbery,

33
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:44,946
and there's two more that'd like to
talk to him on a little matter of murder.

34
00:04:45,242 --> 00:04:47,953
Now maybe you can remember who he is.

35
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:52,165
Quit your stalling. Where is he?

36
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,418
I don't know what you're talking about.

37
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,297
Don't you try to Ritz me, Ritzie.

38
00:05:02,384 --> 00:05:04,196
Where did you see him last?

39
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,655
I don't remember.

40
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:07,449
Oh, you won't talk, eh?

41
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,534
Well, maybe you can tell me this.

42
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:13,538
Who was the other half of the bench picnic
in the park tonight?

43
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:15,730
Bench picnic?

44
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,525
I was in the park tonight
but I was alone.

45
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:20,735
Your men must be seeing double, Inspector.

46
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:24,114
Oh, my men were seeing double,
were they?

47
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:29,828
Well, here's the other half
of what they saw.

48
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,190
I've had enough of this stalling.

49
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:43,235
You two have been meeting night after night
for months and I know it.

50
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,986
Well, supposing we have been meeting.

51
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:46,655
Being in love is no crime yet.

52
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,490
Maybe not,
but being in love with her

53
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,642
is apt to cause you a lot of trouble,
young fellow.

54
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:55,437
I wonder if you know
that she is the girlfriend

55
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:58,190
of the most notorious criminal
this state has ever known.

56
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,918
She's been a member of his gang
for two years,

57
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,360
ever since she met him.

58
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,820
I don't know
a woman in this city

59
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,281
that knows more about him
and his affairs than she does.

60
00:06:05,322 --> 00:06:07,824
I know all about that.
That's all over now.

61
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,761
- Where's Thunderbolt?
- I don't know and I don't care.

62
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:12,496
- What do you do for a living?
- I work at a bank.

63
00:06:13,622 --> 00:06:17,917
How would you like to lose your job
and maybe work in a penitentiary?

64
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,062
That's where you're headed...

65
00:06:19,086 --> 00:06:21,129
You let him alone.

66
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,483
He's on the level.

67
00:06:23,507 --> 00:06:25,443
He's got nothing to do with that crowd.

68
00:06:25,467 --> 00:06:28,613
Listen, Ritzie, you're a smart girl
and you can save yourself a lot of trouble

69
00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:30,740
by giving us a line on Thunderbolt.

70
00:06:30,764 --> 00:06:33,201
You know we can make it pretty hot for you.

71
00:06:33,225 --> 00:06:35,537
You've got nothing on me
and you know it.

72
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,355
If you had,
you'd have locked me up long ago.

73
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,858
I'm through with that mob for good.

74
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,400
Whatever mistakes I've made,
I've paid for in my own way.

75
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:48,907
What do you say, Chief?

76
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:51,034
Shall I take 'em down and book 'em?

77
00:06:51,076 --> 00:06:52,577
Never mind.

78
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,456
You can go now.

79
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:57,540
Let her go.

80
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,429
Goodnight, Inspector.

81
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:13,223
And thank you.

82
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,358
Don't let that dame out of your sight.

83
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,361
Thunderbolt will go through an iron wall
to see her.

84
00:07:26,403 --> 00:07:29,114
And we want to be there
when they meet.

85
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:31,616
There's always the chance
of nabbing him

86
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:34,244
as long as she's out.

87
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,320
Good evening, Mr. Th-Th-Thunderbolt.

88
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,946
I got your phone call.

89
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,409
- The the best in the house.
- All right, Oscar.

90
00:08:16,745 --> 00:08:18,788
Check your hat, sir?

91
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,458
No thanks.

92
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,377
I never know
when I'm going to leave in a hurry.

93
00:08:25,587 --> 00:08:28,506
I always like to have my hat be with me.

94
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:34,280
Say, boy, am I seeing right?

95
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:35,907
Is that Thunderbolt?

96
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:38,159
Does that mean
there's gonna be any trouble?

97
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:39,244
Maybe not.

98
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,770
I'm keeping one foot (unintelligible).

99
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:16,406
Say, (unintelligible) Thunderbolt?

100
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:20,930
He hits you with that big right soupbone
and just ruins you,

101
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,520
all in one little smackeroo.

102
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,522
That's why they call him Thunderbolt.

103
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,858
Say, one little piece of lead

104
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,612
and the littlest guy'

 leave even
as big... The biggest man dead.

105
00:09:31,653 --> 00:09:34,656
Say, why don't nobody take a shot at him?

106
00:09:34,698 --> 00:09:37,409
Well,
the cemetery's full of them that missed.

107
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,662
Let's have some real service, Oscar.

108
00:09:40,704 --> 00:09:43,415
And your r-r-regular order, sir?

109
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,499
Right.

110
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,459
What are you going to have, baby?

111
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,628
Nothing.

112
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:52,192
That means she'll have a chicken sandwich
and a glass of milk.

113
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,468
Y-y-yes, boss, yes.

114
00:09:57,721 --> 00:09:59,908
What's the matter, Ritzie,
what are you sore about?

115
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,409
I'm not sore.

116
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:03,810
What good would it do if I were?

117
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:08,356
What are you looking at?

118
00:10:08,398 --> 00:10:12,777
I'm looking at nothing,
and it's wearing a tuxedo.

119
00:10:14,863 --> 00:10:15,989
Who are you talking to?

120
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:18,259
Stay right with him, baby.
Don't let him get away with anything.

121
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:20,410
You might be lightning
to a lot of people,

122
00:10:20,452 --> 00:10:23,580
but you're just a wet match to me.

123
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,280
Say, you big bozo.

124
00:10:39,304 --> 00:10:41,533
That ain't no way to treat a lady.

125
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,599
No?

126
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,268
Give me that gun.

127
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:52,943
So you don't like the way I treat a lady,
huh?

128
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,699
I ain't gonna wait
for that ham sandwich another minute.

129
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,199
I ain't hungry. Is you?

130
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,886
Oh boy, somebody better call an ambulance.

131
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,203
You wait till I get home,
I'm gonna tell my husband.

132
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:07,290
L-I-lady, why don't you stop?

133
00:11:07,332 --> 00:11:09,769
- There's gonna be trouble in here in a minute.
- I'm all wet.

134
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:12,587
I told you he was gon' hit her.

135
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:16,132
- Take it easy, huh, be careful.
- Are they gonna shoot again?

136
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:21,239
- Snapper.
- Wait a minute.

137
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,740
Get back there.

138
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:25,285
Where do you guys think you're going?

139
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,578
Watch 'em, Jimmy.

140
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,204
I wanna go home.

141
00:11:28,228 --> 00:11:29,270
Sit down.

142
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,733
Hey, the two of you men,

143
00:11:32,774 --> 00:11:34,692
clean up this mess out here.

144
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,278
(unintelligible).

145
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,696
Everything all right, chief?

146
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:38,905
Tough crowd here tonight.

147
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:40,633
Yeah, how do you feel tonight, Snapper?

148
00:11:40,657 --> 00:11:42,367
Oh, fine, chief.

149
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:43,827
Hello there, Ritzie.

150
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,036
Have some nuts.

151
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:46,245
Great for the system.

152
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,415
Fills up the body.

153
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,709
How about your mind?

154
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,066
What do we do with her, Snapper?

155
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:01,362
Oh, drag that cluck outta here, will ya?

156
00:12:01,386 --> 00:12:04,490
A couple of yous guys.

157
00:12:04,514 --> 00:12:06,265
Let me help you, Snapper.

158
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:09,329
Hey, lay off that, will ya?

159
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,897
That's my trigger finger.

160
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:14,191
What a fine night this is.

161
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,237
Oh, uh, listen up, boy.

162
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:21,197
Oh, uh, oh, uh, get out of here.

163
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,282
Music, boys.

164
00:12:29,706 --> 00:12:33,251
I suppose you thought it was funny
starting that ruckus.

165
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:37,023
Strikes me you could stand
a little cooling off.

166
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,067
How would you like
a dose of it yourself?

167
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,151
Go right ahead.

168
00:12:40,175 --> 00:12:42,760
I wouldn't put it past you for a minute.

169
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:53,438
<i>When night is creepin'
and I should be sleepin' in bed</i>

170
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,608
What are you trying to do, baby,
get me sore?

171
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,713
<i>If you were peepin'
you'd find that I'm weepin' instead</i>

172
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:03,573
Jim, I'm going to quit.

173
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,241
What, again?

174
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,493
I mean it this time.

175
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:08,245
I've been trying to tell you.

176
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,539
I'm not going on with it anymore.

177
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,082
- <i>I'm</i> through.
<i>- Night after night</i>

178
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,543
Through with what?

179
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:17,897
What are you talking about?

180
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:19,399
All this.

181
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,401
These people.

182
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,467
You.

183
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,075
<i>No one can fill
that vacant chair</i>

184
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,035
We're going to have this out right now.

185
00:13:31,059 --> 00:13:32,870
<i>When you're not there</i>

186
00:13:32,894 --> 00:13:37,394
<i>No need to knock,
the door is open for you</i>

187
00:13:38,608 --> 00:13:41,944
<i>-Please, daddy</i>
-We'll <i>find</i> a place where <i>we can</i> talk.

188
00:13:43,947 --> 00:13:44,989
Come on.

189
00:13:47,075 --> 00:13:51,162
<i>Daddy, do you have to roam so very long?</i>

190
00:13:51,204 --> 00:13:52,872
Come on.

191
00:13:52,914 --> 00:13:57,414
<i>There's lots of other new sheiks
who would like to be sheikin'</i>

192
00:13:57,961 --> 00:13:59,837
Come on, baby.

193
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:05,381
<i>Daddy, daddy, daddy,
won't you please come home?</i>

194
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,743
<i>Night after night, I'm or yin'</i>

195
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:15,079
<i>Daddy, won't you please come home?</i>

196
00:14:15,103 --> 00:14:18,022
<i>Daddy,
won't you please come home?</i>

197
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:22,069
<i>I'm so lonesome</i>

198
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:25,196
<i>No one can fill
that vacant chair</i>

199
00:14:25,238 --> 00:14:28,532
<i>Home isn't home
if you're not there</i>

200
00:14:28,575 --> 00:14:33,075
<i>No need to knock,
the door is open for you</i>

201
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:35,373
<i>Sweet daddy</i>

202
00:14:35,415 --> 00:14:38,626
<i>Even the clock keeps tickin'</i>

203
00:14:38,668 --> 00:14:41,981
<i>Daddy, won't you please come home?</i>

204
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:46,505
<i>Daddy, do you have to roam so very long?</i>

205
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:52,052
<i>There's lots of other new sheiks
who would like to be sheikin'</i>

206
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:55,453
<i>Haven't slipped yet,
but I'm liable to weaken</i>

207
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:59,977
<i>Daddy, daddy, won't you please come home?</i>

208
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,747
I don't get you at all.

209
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:19,584
You tell me you want to step out tonight,
go somewhere that's lively.

210
00:15:19,626 --> 00:15:22,045
I risk my neck
by walking into this joint,

211
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,191
with all the cops
in the world on my trail.

212
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,984
There's a 10-to-1 shot
there's a couple of dicks

213
00:15:27,008 --> 00:15:30,613
shadowing you right now to get to me.

214
00:15:30,637 --> 00:15:32,657
It's all right with me.

215
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,326
I can take care of myself.

216
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,895
But I do all this,
I take this big chance,

217
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:40,563
and your idea
of the way to behave

218
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:44,877
is to start that foolishness
all over again.

219
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:46,569
What's the big idea?

220
00:15:46,611 --> 00:15:48,070
It's just this, Jim.

221
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,448
I want to be decent again.

222
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:54,160
Well, babe, you've always been
the most decent kid in the racket.

223
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:01,917
You know, I used to get a big kick
out of being your girl,

224
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,896
out of knowing that
you'd take a chance on your life

225
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,213
just to see me
for a few minutes.

226
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:22,105
You're the swellest girl
I ever knew.

227
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,862
You wouldn't want to keep me
if I didn't want to stay, would you, Jim?

228
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,947
Wouldn't I?

229
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:36,661
I'd keep you with me
if the whole world didn't want you to stay

230
00:16:36,703 --> 00:16:38,663
and make them like it.

231
00:16:38,705 --> 00:16:40,665
That's just it.

232
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:43,751
I don't want people to respect me
because they're afraid

233
00:16:43,793 --> 00:16:45,753
you'll crush their heads
if they don't.

234
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:48,733
I don't want the police trailing me
wherever I go.

235
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:51,968
I don't want people pointing at me
and whispering about me.

236
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:55,281
All this Ritzie talk, boiled down,
means that you...

237
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,366
You're ashamed of me, huh?

238
00:16:57,390 --> 00:17:00,976
No, just ashamed of myself.

239
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,646
I want to know people
who are different from you and me,

240
00:17:03,688 --> 00:17:06,315
people who lead decent, normal lives.

241
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,194
People who get up in the morning
to go to work.

242
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,779
Regular people.

243
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,905
Oh, don't be a fool.

244
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,824
I don't care what you call me, Jim.

245
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:17,326
That's the way I'm going
to live from now on.

246
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,995
I'm going to quit.

247
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,874
Well, let me tell you something, Ritzie.

248
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,376
Maybe I'd like to go straight too.

249
00:17:25,418 --> 00:17:27,461
I haven't thought about it much.

250
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,649
Maybe I don't know how.

251
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:33,468
But as long as I'm going my way,
you're going with me.

252
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,115
You're all I've got
that means anything to me.

253
00:17:38,139 --> 00:17:39,492
Do you think I would...

254
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:42,352
Oh, come on, let's have a good time.

255
00:17:44,312 --> 00:17:46,897
You'll feel better
in the morning.

256
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:59,702
Wait a minute.

257
00:17:59,744 --> 00:18:03,330
You haven't fallen for another guy,
have you?

258
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,792
- Who is he?
- There is no other guy, Jim.

259
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,627
It's just that we're through.

260
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,837
You and me will never be through, Ritzie.

261
00:18:09,879 --> 00:18:11,566
Get that straight.

262
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,528
You're my girl and nobody on earth
can take you away from me.

263
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:19,448
Do you think you could hold me
if I didn't love you anymore?

264
00:18:19,472 --> 00:18:20,992
That don't worry me.

265
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,787
It's the guy that tries to take you away
from me that's got the worrying to do.

266
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:29,311
Oh, I know, it would be easy enough for you
to get your gang to do anything.

267
00:18:29,482 --> 00:18:33,777
That's one job
I wouldn't let anybody do for me.

268
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,200
Come on, baby.

269
00:18:39,242 --> 00:18:41,327
Come on.

270
00:18:52,213 --> 00:18:55,651
I'd get that guy by myself

271
00:18:55,675 --> 00:19:00,175
if it was the last thing
in this world I ever did.

272
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:17,196
Uh-oh.

273
00:19:17,238 --> 00:19:21,242
W-w—w-what... what's that n-n-now?

274
00:19:21,284 --> 00:19:24,245
I told you this was gonna happen.

275
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:27,999
Hey, get off my foot.

276
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,459
Find that light switch.

277
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,003
Don't get excited, folks,
it's only a little raid.

278
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,857
Everybody who can stand to pitch
will kindly keep their seats.

279
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:38,259
Stand still there or I'll shoot.

280
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,281
Don't move.

281
00:19:42,305 --> 00:19:43,699
I ain't movin', boss.

282
00:19:43,723 --> 00:19:45,975
I've been pushed.

283
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,668
Where is Thunderbolt?
Come clean.

284
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,002
Where is he?

285
00:20:14,587 --> 00:20:16,380
I don't know.

286
00:20:19,008 --> 00:20:21,969
And I don't ever want to know.

287
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:49,789
I want you men to get this
and get it straight.

288
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,166
It's been two months since Thunderbolt
got away from you

289
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:54,960
and he's got to be found.

290
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:58,983
Thunderbolt's girl's been living up
at Young Moran's house for weeks

291
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,277
with the kid and his mother.

292
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:05,801
Don't tell me that that kid doesn't know
something about Thunderbolt.

293
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,826
Put the works on him.

294
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,578
He'll talk

295
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:15,102
when it's a question of talking
or being out of a job.

296
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,578
Mr. Corwin wants to see you, Bob.

297
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,622
Okay, Jimmy.

298
00:21:44,427 --> 00:21:46,489
You sent for me, Mr. Corwin?

299
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,555
Yes.

300
00:21:48,723 --> 00:21:49,765
Sit down.

301
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:04,280
Hello, Mom.

302
00:22:05,448 --> 00:22:07,825
- You're late, Bob.
- Yeah, I stayed overtime.

303
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:09,827
- Hello, dear.
- Hello.

304
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:12,162
I'm so glad you're here, Bob,
we were worried.

305
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,790
Oh, I'm sorry, Mary,
but there's nothing to worry about.

306
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,477
Everything was all right at the bank,
wasn't it?

307
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,669
Everything was perfect.

308
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,776
Yes, sir, everything was perfect.

309
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,737
- Until about 4:00.
- What happened about 4:00?

310
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:27,863
Nothing much.

311
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:29,740
I just got fired.

312
00:22:29,764 --> 00:22:32,284
That's why I stayed late
to turn over my accounts.

313
00:22:32,308 --> 00:22:33,452
You're joking?

314
00:22:33,476 --> 00:22:35,621
I'm not joking, it's the truth.

315
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,438
What was it, Bob?
What was the matter?

316
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,901
Nothing, Mr. Corwin and I just couldn't
agree on how a bank should be run.

317
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:44,779
It was on my account, wasn't it?

318
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,298
Don't be silly.

319
00:22:46,322 --> 00:22:48,991
Tell me, Bob, I've got to know.

320
00:22:49,033 --> 00:22:51,201
They just told me
I'd have to make a choice.

321
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,847
Either I'd have to give you up or else...

322
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:53,955
Or else what?

323
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:56,082
Just or else, that's all.

324
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,376
Well, I'm glad you quit.

325
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:02,213
I never could understand
why you wanted to stay at that bank anyhow.

326
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,275
I don't think there was much chance
for you there.

327
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:07,152
Wherever you go,
they'll always be finding out about me.

328
00:23:07,176 --> 00:23:09,446
Let 'em,
there's nothing to find out about you.

329
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:12,283
You know, I always thought
you were too good for that place.

330
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,767
They didn't appreciate you.

331
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,438
Oh, don't start crying, dear.

332
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,333
You'll get your nose red.

333
00:23:21,357 --> 00:23:23,734
A thing like this doesn't bother us,
does it, Mom?

334
00:23:23,776 --> 00:23:25,778
We've looked for jobs before.

335
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,298
I should never have come here at all.

336
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,489
I knew it wasn't right.

337
00:23:28,531 --> 00:23:30,533
What wasn't right?

338
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:34,120
Coming to live here
with you and your mother.

339
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,247
You've been wonderful to me.

340
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,666
And this is the way
I'm repaying you,

341
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:39,792
getting you discharged.

342
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:42,419
You're working yourself up
over nothing, Mary.

343
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,815
What if I do lose a job now and then?

344
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:46,567
What difference does it make?

345
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:50,070
Come on, let's all go out
and have a good time tonight.

346
00:23:50,094 --> 00:23:52,698
Oh, Bob, your mother's
fixed a lovely supper for us.

347
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,283
The lovely supper will keep.

348
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,367
Bob is right.

349
00:23:55,391 --> 00:23:57,870
What you two need is to go out
and enjoy yourselves.

350
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:00,289
Yeah,
we can't let a chance like this go by.

351
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,690
I may not get fired again
for a long time.

352
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,483
I've got some mending to do.

353
00:24:04,525 --> 00:24:06,318
You children go along by yourselves.

354
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:09,030
Come now.
Come and get all dressed up.

355
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,698
There you are.

356
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:19,832
(unintelligible).

357
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,900
Did someone knock, Bob?

358
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,986
I thought I heard a knock.

359
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:32,886
There's no one out here.

360
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:37,117
Come on, get your hat, Bob.

361
00:24:37,141 --> 00:24:38,202
Run along, dear.

362
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,353
- Have a good time.
- Goodnight.

363
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,689
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Mom.

364
00:25:15,596 --> 00:25:18,283
Now, don't feel that way.

365
00:25:18,307 --> 00:25:20,475
Nothing important has happened.

366
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:23,747
The thing that gets me
is that I was expecting a promotion,

367
00:25:23,771 --> 00:25:25,689
and you know what that meant.

368
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:26,983
I'm not gonna wait any longer.

369
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,861
As soon as I get a job again,
we're going to be married.

370
00:25:29,902 --> 00:25:32,112
There's no sense in waiting.

371
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,409
Well, if it ain't the long lost child.

372
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,469
Hello there, Ritzie.

373
00:25:37,493 --> 00:25:40,162
Well, it was a long time finding ya.

374
00:25:40,204 --> 00:25:41,622
I think you've made a mistake.

375
00:25:41,664 --> 00:25:44,208
You made a mistake, baby,
thinking you could keep out of sight.

376
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,253
- Come on, Bob.
- So this is the old hideaway, is it?

377
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:50,506
Well, I guess you know Thunderbolt's
been looking high and low for ya, don't ya?

378
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:51,984
Why didn't you let him know
where you were?

379
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,318
Drop him a postcard or something.

380
00:25:53,342 --> 00:25:55,112
I'm not interested in Thunderbolt.

381
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,698
You're not, huh?

382
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:02,222
And this is the Kewpie that made a sucker
out of Thunderbolt, huh?

383
00:26:02,643 --> 00:26:05,914
Well, I wouldn't be in your shoes
for all the rice in China.

384
00:26:05,938 --> 00:26:07,397
Stay on the level, Ritzie.

385
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,817
What have you been doing
with yourself all this time?

386
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,277
Take your hand off her.

387
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,504
Don't shove me.

388
00:26:12,528 --> 00:26:14,071
I'll shove ya.

389
00:26:14,113 --> 00:26:15,507
Well, I'll teach you to shove me.

390
00:26:15,531 --> 00:26:17,616
Look out, Bob, he's got a gun!

391
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,641
Come on, Bob, let's go back upstairs.

392
00:26:24,665 --> 00:26:26,875
I'd like to take another sock at that guy.

393
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,252
You've hurt your hand too.

394
00:26:28,294 --> 00:26:29,336
Come on, Bob.

395
00:26:31,714 --> 00:26:35,069
Did you fall downstairs?

396
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:39,114
- Why, what happened?
- He fell downstairs, the poor man.

397
00:26:39,138 --> 00:26:42,201
I'd put a piece of fresh beef steak
on that eye if I were you.

398
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,786
Well, you ain't me.

399
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,705
My sister always puts a key
down the back of her neck

400
00:26:46,729 --> 00:26:48,480
to stop a nosebleed.

401
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:51,484
I'll slip something down the back of
your neck if you don't leave me alone.

402
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,195
Where's the nearest telephone
around here?

403
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,781
Well, here,
don't you dare go near there.

404
00:26:56,823 --> 00:27:00,076
Oh, I just hate to see anybody hurt.

405
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,079
Oh, now a squalling baby.

406
00:27:06,165 --> 00:27:08,041
Why, what's the matter?

407
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:11,128
Nothing.
She talked me out of going out.

408
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,463
You've hurt your hand.
What's happened?

409
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,925
I guess I knocked it
against something.

410
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,597
What's happened, Mary?

411
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:24,118
We ran into a man I used to know.

412
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:27,246
He tried to get fresh
and Bob had to hit him.

413
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,814
Oh, I... I see, I...

414
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,151
Well, we'll put something on it.

415
00:27:33,192 --> 00:27:34,419
- Don't bother, Mom.
- No, come on,

416
00:27:34,443 --> 00:27:36,088
we'll wash it out
and put some iodine on it.

417
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,422
I don't want any of that stuff on it.

418
00:27:37,446 --> 00:27:40,240
Took a week for it to
wear off the last time.

419
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:43,702
I don't want anything on it.

420
00:27:45,037 --> 00:27:46,913
That water could be hot.

421
00:27:48,207 --> 00:27:50,250
Mom, you treat me like I was a baby.

422
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,919
That's all you act like
when you're hurt.

423
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,045
Well, I ain't hurt.

424
00:27:53,087 --> 00:27:55,274
You got me mixed up
with the other guy.

425
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,692
I'll bet you never touched
the other guy.

426
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,820
Yeah? Well, no mother'

 be able
to fix him up for a long time.

427
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:03,013
That's what you say.
I'd like to see him to believe that.

428
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,645
Answer the telephone, Mary.

429
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:21,907
Mary, answer the telephone.

430
00:28:27,496 --> 00:28:28,538
Hello?

431
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:36,088
How's every little thing?

432
00:28:40,676 --> 00:28:43,261
I'll be coming up your way.

433
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,370
I can't, eh?

434
00:28:50,394 --> 00:28:52,771
I'll come right down.

435
00:28:52,813 --> 00:28:54,773
What for?

436
00:28:54,815 --> 00:28:57,317
It won't make any difference
to your boyfriend.

437
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,945
You might as well say goodbye
to him now.

438
00:28:59,987 --> 00:29:03,365
I just called up
to give you fair warning.

439
00:29:10,831 --> 00:29:12,976
- Let's put this iodine on it.
- I don't want any iodine.

440
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,752
Now hold still, hold still.

441
00:29:16,545 --> 00:29:18,296
Ouch. Ow!

442
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,277
Now look what you've done.

443
00:29:22,301 --> 00:29:23,820
All over my clean floor.

444
00:29:23,844 --> 00:29:25,679
I'll clean it up.

445
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:28,325
Not my towels!

446
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,993
Ouch.

447
00:29:30,017 --> 00:29:32,829
Do nothing but buy towels for this place.

448
00:29:32,853 --> 00:29:34,414
Look out there now.

449
00:29:34,438 --> 00:29:37,816
You know I keep
the floor cloths under here.

450
00:29:37,858 --> 00:29:39,067
Look at that iodine.

451
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,486
You never can get that up.

452
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,714
Well, I told you not to bring it out,
didn't I?

453
00:29:42,738 --> 00:29:44,030
I'd like to put some on your...

454
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:45,908
Jiggers, Mom, I'm gettin' sore now.

455
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,160
Well, what do you do if you get sore?

456
00:29:48,202 --> 00:29:49,846
Well, I'll show you,
I'm bigger than you are.

457
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,580
Yes, well...

458
00:29:51,622 --> 00:29:53,892
- Give me the napkin.
- Not look, you'll get your hands all dirty.

459
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:55,959
Give me that rag.
Give me that rag.

460
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,629
I'm telling you, there's nothing...

461
00:29:58,671 --> 00:29:59,713
Bob, now, stop it.

462
00:29:59,755 --> 00:30:01,858
You're nothing but a big baby.

463
00:30:01,882 --> 00:30:04,152
NOW Will you stop it?

464
00:30:04,176 --> 00:30:05,218
Let go.

465
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,617
Say, Bob, now who do you think I am?

466
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:12,577
You're not fighting with
that fella down there!

467
00:30:12,601 --> 00:30:14,936
Yeah, I'm working with you, Mom.

468
00:30:19,775 --> 00:30:21,234
Stop it!

469
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:23,570
Bob, please! Ow!

470
00:31:27,301 --> 00:31:29,219
Go on, get out of here. Beat it.

471
00:31:39,855 --> 00:31:41,356
I can't find her.

472
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,568
Well, now don't worry, she's only gone
to the grocer's or something.

473
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:47,446
I know, but she's been gone
such a long time.

474
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,698
But here's her pocketbook and gloves.

475
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,843
- She'll be back soon.
- Now, I'm worried.

476
00:31:51,867 --> 00:31:53,345
Well, I'm the one
that ought to be worried

477
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:56,080
with the dinner getting cold
and everything.

478
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:58,082
Do you think we oughta call
the police?

479
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:02,169
Now, Bob, don't be so silly.

480
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,922
She'll be back in less than no time.

481
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,342
Hello?

482
00:32:38,664 --> 00:32:41,583
Katie! Katie!

483
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:43,877
Yes?

484
00:32:44,753 --> 00:32:46,296
Are you calling me, Annie?

485
00:32:46,338 --> 00:32:48,150
You and Bill better come right up.

486
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:49,925
The radio's working again.

487
00:32:49,967 --> 00:32:52,886
I'll be up in a minute,
Bill ain't home yet.

488
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:22,832
Hey, listen,
I thought I told you to beat it.

489
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,001
Now, come on, go home.

490
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,211
I got work to do. Come on, boy.

491
00:33:26,253 --> 00:33:28,630
Nice little dog. Come on.

492
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,735
Come on.

493
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,136
Come on, come on.

494
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,388
Come on.

495
00:33:38,098 --> 00:33:40,118
Come on, boy.

496
00:33:40,142 --> 00:33:41,578
Come on.

497
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,829
Come on, boy.

498
00:33:42,853 --> 00:33:43,895
Come on.

499
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,400
Come on, boy.

500
00:33:48,442 --> 00:33:49,484
Come on, boy.

501
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:51,820
Come on!

502
00:33:51,862 --> 00:33:53,780
Come on, boy.

503
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,121
Come on, boy.

504
00:34:01,163 --> 00:34:02,205
Come on.

505
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,878
Come on, boy.

506
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,254
Come on.

507
00:34:09,296 --> 00:34:10,690
Come on, boy.

508
00:34:10,714 --> 00:34:11,756
Come on.

509
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:24,102
Ain't he cute?

510
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:32,695
I just love dogs.

511
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,040
Come on.

512
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,461
Come on.

513
00:34:49,503 --> 00:34:51,254
Come on, get out of here, get out.

514
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,340
Go on, get out. Beat it!

515
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,425
Stay out.

516
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,051
Now, Bob, don't go near that door.

517
00:35:20,075 --> 00:35:21,659
I'm not going near the door, Mom.

518
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,662
Come on away now.

519
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,774
There's that bark again.

520
00:35:34,798 --> 00:35:37,068
Well, what if a dog does bark?

521
00:35:37,092 --> 00:35:39,279
I didn't know there was a dog in the house.

522
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,823
Don't go out, Bob.

523
00:35:41,847 --> 00:35:43,992
Please, for my sake.

524
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:46,768
Don't go out until Mary returns.

525
00:35:48,937 --> 00:35:50,332
What are you barking for?

526
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,107
I thought I told you to beat it.

527
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:54,234
You're going for a walk.

528
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:11,251
You poor little mutt.

529
00:36:11,293 --> 00:36:12,544
Go on home.

530
00:36:12,586 --> 00:36:14,296
If you've got a home.

531
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,131
I've got no time to play with you now.

532
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:19,384
Put up your hands,
you're under arrest.

533
00:36:26,266 --> 00:36:27,600
All right, put 'em up.

534
00:36:29,144 --> 00:36:30,979
And keep 'em up.

535
00:36:33,315 --> 00:36:34,983
Frisk him, Bill.

536
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:53,168
Slip the bracelets on him.

537
00:37:05,013 --> 00:37:06,574
Get back up there.
What are you doing up here?

538
00:37:06,598 --> 00:37:09,077
Go on, go wait upstairs.

539
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,061
Go on, upstairs, everybody.

540
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:15,023
Come on, keep movin' there, keep movin'.

541
00:37:17,609 --> 00:37:20,194
Wait up there, now go on,
now get back up there.

542
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:27,703
Well, well, well, Thunderbolt.

543
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:31,748
Long time no see.

544
00:37:42,801 --> 00:37:45,321
You guys are all alike.

545
00:37:45,345 --> 00:37:49,845
No brains, no brains.

546
00:37:49,933 --> 00:37:52,894
Your dame told us
you were coming here.

547
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:03,572
A lot of help you were.

548
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:07,326
To think it took a mutt like you
to send me up.

549
00:38:07,367 --> 00:38:08,618
I didn't know you had a dog.

550
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,161
Is he yours?

551
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,289
He is now.

552
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:15,083
He cost me plenty.

553
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,128
Ain't he beautiful?

554
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,963
I wouldn't brag about him.

555
00:38:20,005 --> 00:38:21,756
Come on, boys.

556
00:39:00,462 --> 00:39:01,671
Let me go down there.

557
00:39:01,713 --> 00:39:02,714
Let me!

558
00:39:02,756 --> 00:39:04,359
What right have you got
to keep me back?

559
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,425
Just stay back.

560
00:39:07,302 --> 00:39:08,363
Oh, Bob.

561
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:09,781
What is the matter, Mary,
what happened?

562
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,283
Go into the... go into the house,
go on, children.

563
00:39:12,307 --> 00:39:14,911
I wonder what she's got to do with it.

564
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:15,977
I don't know.

565
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,131
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

566
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:46,442
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

567
00:39:46,466 --> 00:39:50,966
<i>I want to go to heaven when I die
to hear sweet Jordan roll</i>

568
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:54,349
<i>Brother, you ought to been there</i>

569
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:56,870
<i>Yes, my Lord</i>

570
00:39:56,894 --> 00:40:01,394
<i>A-sitting in the kingdom
for to hear sweet Jordan roll</i>

571
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,335
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

572
00:40:04,359 --> 00:40:06,569
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

573
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:11,112
<i>I want to go to heaven when I die
to hear sweet Jordan roll</i>

574
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:14,702
<i>Sister, you ought to been there</i>

575
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:18,123
<i>Yes, my Lord</i>

576
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:22,665
<i>A-sitting in the kingdom
for to hear sweet Jordan roll</i>

577
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:27,483
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

578
00:40:27,507 --> 00:40:30,236
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

579
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:34,760
<i>I want to go to heaven when I die
to hear sweet Jordan roll</i>

580
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:39,579
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

581
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:42,897
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

582
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,440
<i>I want to go to heaven when I die
to hear sweet Jordan roll</i>

583
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:06,834
Say,
this piano will need tuning pretty soon.

584
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,756
Yes.

585
00:41:11,009 --> 00:41:15,509
I wish there were a way of telling
when a human being's out of tune.

586
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:25,523
Couldn't be more comfortable at the Ritz.

587
00:41:25,565 --> 00:41:26,941
One-Way Street, huh?

588
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,987
Everything coming in
and nothing going out.

589
00:41:44,459 --> 00:41:47,378
Now take care of yourself
and don't catch cold.

590
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,256
Plenty of blankets here.

591
00:41:49,297 --> 00:41:50,775
And look out for pneumonia.

592
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:53,510
Don't want to give this place
a bad name.

593
00:42:09,234 --> 00:42:13,613
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

594
00:42:13,655 --> 00:42:17,367
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

595
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:22,785
<i>I want to go to Heaven when I die
to hear sweet Jordan roll</i>

596
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:31,172
Hey, Number 3!

597
00:42:32,549 --> 00:42:35,236
Hey you, new guy.

598
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,238
You're Number 3.

599
00:42:37,262 --> 00:42:39,323
You might as well get
me right from the start.

600
00:42:39,347 --> 00:42:42,744
I'm Number 1 anywhere.

601
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:47,268
Well, Number 3 or... or Number 1
or whatever you are,

602
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:50,775
do you sing tenor?

603
00:42:50,817 --> 00:42:52,151
Who me?

604
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:54,362
I kill tenors.

605
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,658
Oh, a tough guy, hey?

606
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:01,119
Too bad you ain't a tenor.

607
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:04,414
We had a swell quartet,

608
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:07,041
but they took our tenor yesterday.

609
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,336
Hey, Number 4.

610
00:43:10,378 --> 00:43:12,838
What does that new bird look like?

611
00:43:14,299 --> 00:43:18,780
Well, ain't much to be said about him.

612
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:19,888
Pretty big.

613
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:25,723
Got a mug on him
like they use to scare babies with.

614
00:43:25,977 --> 00:43:27,663
Looks like he cuts his hair with a...

615
00:43:27,687 --> 00:43:30,022
Oh, close your trap.

616
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:33,544
Say, is that you, Thunderbolt?

617
00:43:33,568 --> 00:43:35,319
That's me.

618
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:39,862
Reading from left to right, Thunderbolt.

619
00:43:39,991 --> 00:43:41,534
Who wants to know?

620
00:43:41,576 --> 00:43:44,829
Don't tell me that you've forgotten me.

621
00:43:44,871 --> 00:43:47,248
Wait, that sounds like Chuck.

622
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:49,125
Is that you, kid?

623
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:52,336
The kid himself, sure thing.

624
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:56,192
Say, what are you in for, big boy?

625
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,402
Being kind to animals.

626
00:43:58,426 --> 00:44:02,740
I just got too interested in a dog,
that's all.

627
00:44:02,764 --> 00:44:05,076
You know any more jokes?

628
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,103
This place is for killers.

629
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,985
Who is that, a friend of yours, Chuck?

630
00:44:15,026 --> 00:44:18,487
Friend of mine?
I should say not.

631
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:22,033
How long you gonna stop in our hotel, Jim?

632
00:44:22,075 --> 00:44:23,993
About eight weeks.

633
00:44:24,035 --> 00:44:27,204
Anybody else in here I oughta know?

634
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:29,374
Holler roll for him, boys.

635
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:33,916
Joe Ripley, been here so long
I've forgotten what I'm in for.

636
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:36,506
Kentucky Sampson.

637
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:39,443
Caught on the 13th job.

638
00:44:39,467 --> 00:44:43,967
I was that good, the jury brought in a verdict
of guilty before they went out to lunch.

639
00:44:44,472 --> 00:44:47,975
I'm next door, Jim, Number 5.

640
00:44:50,103 --> 00:44:52,415
Hey, Pat, give me a light, will ya?

641
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:54,649
<i>Everybody talkin' 'bout Heaven
ain't goin' there</i>

642
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:57,152
<i>Heaven, Heaven</i>

643
00:44:57,194 --> 00:45:00,739
<i>Gonna shout all over,
goin' to Heaven</i>

644
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,115
Leave those matches here, will you, Pat?

645
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:05,034
I would (unintelligible).

646
00:45:05,076 --> 00:45:07,578
Sure, you know it's against the rules.

647
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:11,291
And furthermore, my name is not Pat.

648
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,376
- What is your name?
- Don't tell him!

649
00:45:13,418 --> 00:45:16,254
Make him guess!

650
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,089
Number 6.

651
00:45:18,131 --> 00:45:21,676
Making my exit today.

652
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:24,447
<i>I got a song, you got a song</i>

653
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:27,366
<i>All of God's children got a song</i>

654
00:45:27,390 --> 00:45:30,912
Number 7 is at the piano.

655
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:34,123
Special dispensation from the warden.

656
00:45:34,147 --> 00:45:37,668
Number 8, (unintelligible) Roberts.

657
00:45:37,692 --> 00:45:40,027
Murder in the first degree.

658
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,113
Brought up by honest parents.

659
00:45:42,155 --> 00:45:45,491
At least, they was honest as far as I know.

660
00:45:45,533 --> 00:45:50,033
Absolutely on the level
until my 12th birthday.

661
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:59,774
Number 9's still in the hospital, I guess.

662
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:03,277
Number 10, now broadcasting.

663
00:46:03,301 --> 00:46:06,155
Bad AI Frieberg, that's me.

664
00:46:06,179 --> 00:46:09,909
I guess I don't have to tell you who I am.

665
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,078
Maybe you should.

666
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,288
I never heard of you.

667
00:46:14,312 --> 00:46:15,998
Don't kid me.

668
00:46:16,022 --> 00:46:18,107
Everybody heard about me.

669
00:46:18,149 --> 00:46:21,443
There was whole pages in
the papers when I was caught

670
00:46:21,486 --> 00:46:23,529
Pictures and everything.

671
00:46:23,571 --> 00:46:28,071
The Machine Gun Terror,
that's what they call me.

672
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:31,954
Oh yes, I remember you now.

673
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:35,166
The Machine Gun Terror, huh?

674
00:46:35,208 --> 00:46:39,420
Well,
down my way they call you Squirt Gun AI.

675
00:46:39,462 --> 00:46:41,630
I'll squirt gun you, you big stick.
If I ever...

676
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:46,010
Oh, you big fat head,
I bet you bragged your way into the joint.

677
00:46:48,513 --> 00:46:49,824
Come on, Number 7.

678
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:51,850
Back to your cell.

679
00:47:13,538 --> 00:47:18,038
As I was saying, I was absolutely
on the level until my 12th birthday,

680
00:47:19,502 --> 00:47:24,002
and then, well,
nothing much happened until I was 37.

681
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,844
Then I blew up over a dame!

682
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,657
You're not the only one.

683
00:47:31,681 --> 00:47:33,242
You said it.

684
00:47:33,266 --> 00:47:36,162
There's a dame behind
every guy in this joint.

685
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:38,456
That was the trouble with me.

686
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,149
The dames wouldn't let me alone.

687
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:45,691
I wouldn't be here now if two skirts
hadn't fell for me at the same time.

688
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:50,450
Yeah, I know.

689
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:54,992
Fell for you, you mean tripped
trying to get out of your way.

690
00:47:57,707 --> 00:47:59,625
Say, listen.

691
00:47:59,667 --> 00:48:01,669
I've had about enough out of you.

692
00:48:01,711 --> 00:48:05,066
I'd show you something if they let
me out of here a couple of minutes.

693
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,567
You big cluck!

694
00:48:06,591 --> 00:48:09,153
What would you do, big boy?

695
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,821
I'd do plenty.

696
00:48:10,845 --> 00:48:12,847
Don't you worry about that.

697
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:16,285
I ain't afraid of you or that
phony right hand of yours.

698
00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:19,580
Sure you're not,

699
00:48:19,604 --> 00:48:22,523
with these bars between us.

700
00:48:33,868 --> 00:48:36,161
- Hello, Mr. Moran.
- Hello, Jack.

701
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:38,372
- How are you?
- Fine.

702
00:48:55,056 --> 00:48:57,618
Well, what can I do for you?

703
00:48:57,642 --> 00:49:00,246
Well, you sent for me, Mr. Corwin.

704
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:02,289
I did nothing of the sort.

705
00:49:02,313 --> 00:49:04,023
That's funny.

706
00:49:04,065 --> 00:49:08,319
Your secretary phoned the house yesterday
and left word that you wanted to see me.

707
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,037
Miss Randall has gone to lunch.

708
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,164
Is there anything I can do for you, sir?

709
00:49:20,206 --> 00:49:22,374
No, never mind.

710
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:25,044
I don't see why she
should've called you up.

711
00:49:25,086 --> 00:49:27,671
There's nothing I want to see you about.

712
00:49:30,049 --> 00:49:32,968
Then I'm sorry I bothered you.

713
00:49:46,065 --> 00:49:48,233
Got a match, buddy?

714
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:58,244
Take it easy, Moran.

715
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:01,455
Come on there, all of you,
get your hands up.

716
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:02,624
Keep 'em up!

717
00:50:02,665 --> 00:50:06,043
High up there, face the wall!

718
00:50:06,085 --> 00:50:08,670
Come on, do as I tell you.

719
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:27,978
Even a bank ain't safe
from these gangsters.

720
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:32,487
- Come on, come on.
- Hey!

721
00:50:46,167 --> 00:50:48,085
Come on!

00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:34,275
You seem happy tonight.

730
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:36,968
Just got some great news.

731
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:41,657
What would you call great news?

732
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:43,033
Getting out of here?

733
00:51:43,057 --> 00:51:44,785
That doesn't worry me.

734
00:51:44,809 --> 00:51:48,062
I've always paid my way.

735
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:51,000
What does worry you?

736
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,525

I've got to do this myself.

Get back, get back.

You men will only get me into trouble.

749
00:52:38,821 --> 00:52:41,156
I'll handle this.

750
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,867
Watch me!

751
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:45,453
Now you turn over that gun
this minute, do you hear?

752
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,079
This is my last warning.

753
00:52:47,121 --> 00:52:49,790
If you don't, we'll just
have to fill you full of bullets!

754
00:52:49,832 --> 00:52:52,292
Go ahead, that's what I want you to do!

755
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:55,880
I don't care how I croak

That's me!

Now listen, AI, listen to reason.

759
00:53:04,889 --> 00:53:07,910
We've got to execute you tonight.

760
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:10,412
Besides, you haven't got a chance, AI.

761
00:53:10,436 --> 00:53:12,915
That gun's empty.

762
00:53:12,939 --> 00:53:16,317
- How do you know?
- We caught the guy who sold it to you.

763
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:19,070
I'll show you whether it's empty or not!

764
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:21,531
Ah, don't point that thing at me!

765
00:53:21,572 --> 00:53:23,198
Bring on your gang.

766
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:27,286
I don't care how I die
as long as I die shooting!

767
00:53:27,328 --> 00:53:29,621
Yeah, you'll die shooting.

768
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:31,957
Shooting off your mouth.

769
00:53:31,999 --> 00:53:34,334
I'll get you too before I'm through!

770
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:37,088
You ain't big enough, little boy.

771
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,441
I'll fill you full of lead
if it's the last thing I do!

772
00:53:39,465 --> 00:53:43,965
Yes, and if I was the warden I'd take that gat
away from you and shove it down your throat.

773
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:48,325
If I could only get close enough
to take a crack at you!

774
00:53:48,349 --> 00:53:52,849
You haven't got the nerve it takes
to crack a slot machine.

775
00:54:02,363 --> 00:54:03,697
Get out of the way, boys!

776
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,158
Clear the deck!

777
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:07,177
Give me that gun, you rat.

778
00:54:07,201 --> 00:54:09,620
Give it to you?

779
00:54:09,662 --> 00:54:11,872
I'll give it to you all right!

780
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:21,048

00:54:24,969 --> 00:54:28,824

00:54:28,848 --> 00:54:33,348
<i>Down will come baby, cradle and all</i>

784
00:54:33,436 --> 00:54:36,415
Here's a souvenir for you, warden.

785
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:39,567
<i>When the wind blows, the cradle will rock</i>

786
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,211
Get the doctor!

787
00:54:41,235 --> 00:54:42,903
You get back in your cell!

788
00:54:42,945 --> 00:54:44,154
Go on now!

789
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:48,697
<i>Down will come baby, cradle and all</i>

790
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,069
Thanks, Mike.

791
00:55:06,093 --> 00:55:08,864
My name is not Mike.

792
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:10,848
I'll guess it.

793
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,914
Just a little accident, doc.

794
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:19,899
Somebody hit him.

795
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:22,485
What'd he hit him with, a Sledgehammer?

796
00:55:28,407 --> 00:55:30,117
Looks a like a very dangerous concussion.

797
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:33,662
It won't be fatal, will it?

798
00:55:33,704 --> 00:55:36,665
Listen, doc,
you've just got to see that this man lives.

799
00:55:36,707 --> 00:55:38,041
Do something!

800
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:39,835
I've got to execute him tonight.

801
00:55:39,877 --> 00:55:42,504
Take him to the hospital
and put him on the table.

802
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,801
He's certainly had a terrible shock.

803
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:51,221
Be careful with him, boys.

804
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:57,162
You shouldn't have hit that man so hard,
Jim.

805
00:55:57,186 --> 00:55:59,665
Don't worry about him, warden.

806
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,399
He'll come out of it in a couple of hours.

807
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,651
I just tapped him.

808
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,779
Well, anyway, I'm much obliged to you,

809
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:11,033
and if there's any little favor I could
do for you, that is, within reason.

810
00:56:11,075 --> 00:56:14,745
Well, if it isn't asking too much,

811
00:56:14,787 --> 00:56:18,665
I would like to have that
dog of mine in here with me.

812
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,419
Well, I guess we can
fix that up for you all right.

813
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:25,960
<i>(unintelligible)</i>

814
00:56:26,215 --> 00:56:28,569
I thought I had that quartet broken up.

815
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:31,989
But I no sooner get rid of one
than they send me another.

816
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:34,992
You sure pulled me out of an awful mess.

817
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:36,869
It was a pleasure, warden.

818
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:40,163
I'd have been in a tough spot
if this thing had broken in the papers.

819
00:56:40,187 --> 00:56:42,541
Think of the scandal!

820
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:45,276
I'll fix that dog thing up
for you in a day or two.

821
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:48,029
<i>That brings me back again</i>

822
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:50,572
<i>Down home where I remain</i>

823
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:54,410
<i>Where my honey lamb am</i>

824
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:57,079
<i>I will be right there with bells</i>

00:56:57,121 --> 00:56:59,498
<i>When that old conductor yells</i>

826
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:02,251
<i>All aboard, all aboard</i>

827
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:05,254
<i>All aboard for Alabam</i>

828
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:09,796
<i>Alabam, Alabam</i>

829
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,870
Couldn't be more comfortable at the Ritz.

830
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:21,955
And don't you give me any trouble!

831
00:57:21,979 --> 00:57:24,398
I'm having trouble enough around here.

832
00:57:28,694 --> 00:57:31,530
I'll see you later, Number 4.

833
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,718
Hey, Number 4!

834
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,077
He's calling you, new guy.

835
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,954
You're Number 4.

836
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,498
What are you in for, new guy?

837
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:07,399
They were robbing a bank
and someone got killed,

838
00:58:07,441 --> 00:58:10,610
and they found a revolver in my pocket.

839
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:13,197
You didn't have anything to do with it,
did you?

840
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:14,531
Not a thing.

841
00:58:14,573 --> 00:58:16,241
That's fine.

842
00:58:16,283 --> 00:58:18,702
Now tell us another bedtime story.

843
00:58:21,038 --> 00:58:24,750
Hey, what does he look like, Number 3?

844
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:33,402
Swing around there, buddy,
so I can get a good look at you.

845
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:37,096
Don't be bashful, I'm not gonna bite you.

846
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:44,413
Well, he ain't so bad to look at, I guess.

847
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:48,458
He's got a face like those fellows
on the collar ads,

848
00:58:48,482 --> 00:58:52,611
and I ain't sure but what
he's got a dimple or two.

849
00:58:52,653 --> 00:58:57,153
Beautiful hair and kind of a mushy mouth.

850
00:58:57,366 --> 00:59:00,994
Looks like one of those lady killers,
if you ask me.

851
00:59:02,496 --> 00:59:06,996
The kind a silly dame is bound to fall for.

852
00:59:09,211 --> 00:59:11,713
What's your name, new guy?

853
00:59:15,217 --> 00:59:17,612
Moran, Bob Moran.

854
00:59:17,636 --> 00:59:19,512
Moran, huh?

855
00:59:19,555 --> 00:59:24,055
Say, ain't you the guy I been reading about
that stole Thunderbolt's girl?

856
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:28,081
<i>Take me out to the ball game</i>

857
00:59:28,105 --> 00:59:30,982
<i>Take me out with the crowd</i>

858
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:32,526
<i>Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack</i>

859
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:37,110
It might interest you to know
the guy across the way from you

860
00:59:37,239 --> 00:59:40,992
is a party by the name of Thunderbolt.

861
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:43,662
You two guys oughta know each other better.

862
00:59:43,704 --> 00:59:48,204
<i>One, two, three strikes, you're out,
at the old ball game</i>

863
00:59:49,418 --> 00:59:52,003
You put me in here, you framed me!

864
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:54,465
You know I'm innocent, you're in on it!

865
00:59:54,507 --> 00:59:57,360
I'd like to get my hands on you just once!

866
00:59:57,384 --> 01:00:00,072
Just once, just once!

867
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:02,741
<i>If I never get back,
let me root, root, root</i>

868
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:04,618
You've got me wrong, kid.

869
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:06,536
I've never done anything to you.

870
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:11,060
You're a dirty liar, you framed me,
you got me into this!

871
01:00:11,273 --> 01:00:14,776
I'm not afraid of you, I'm not scared!

872
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:17,571
I'm not afraid to die!

873
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:32,377
Over, lay over.

874
01:00:32,419 --> 01:00:35,380
Thatta boy, there.

875
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:39,402
Say, Thunderbolt!

876
01:00:39,426 --> 01:00:43,865
If it's all the same to you, will you stop
teaching that dog to roll over and play dead?

877
01:00:43,889 --> 01:00:46,099
He's giving me the willies.

878
01:01:22,469 --> 01:01:24,489
Get the handcuff crew.

879
01:01:24,513 --> 01:01:27,576
Hey, up there on the upper deck,
front and center.

880
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,435
Yo!

881
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:42,740
The district attorney wants to see you,
down in my office.

882
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:46,827
What does he want?

883
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,245
I don't know.

884
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:53,583
Well,
I don't want him bothering me anymore.

885
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:56,170
I got enough to worry about as it is.

886
01:01:56,212 --> 01:02:00,712
Well, you haven't got much longer
to worry about anything.

887
01:02:01,425 --> 01:02:04,571
So you've set the date for my kick-off,
have you?

888
01:02:04,595 --> 01:02:06,031
Yup.

889
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:09,367
I've got two for the
week of January the 7th.

890
01:02:09,391 --> 01:02:11,995
Who's the other one?

891
01:02:12,019 --> 01:02:15,957
Moran goes on Monday
and you're set for Saturday.

892
01:02:15,981 --> 01:02:18,066
That's great.

893
01:02:20,152 --> 01:02:23,238
You know, I was glad that your lawyers
got you that temporary reprieve

894
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,490
so that you could be
around a little while longer.

895
01:02:25,532 --> 01:02:27,784
You don't take it so hard.

896
01:02:27,826 --> 01:02:30,370
But some of these other fellas...

897
01:02:30,412 --> 01:02:33,498
- Come on, get him out of there.
- Hey, warden!

898
01:02:37,419 --> 01:02:41,464
I may be seconds to death,
but you've got no right to make me listen

899
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:45,362
to that same piece of music
every time that band plays here.

900
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:47,447
It's cruel and inhuman.

901
01:02:47,471 --> 01:02:51,224
I come here for rest and recreation.

902
01:02:53,185 --> 01:02:55,789
You're just plain ungrateful, that's all.

903
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:57,666
I'm sorry you ever came here.

904
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:00,192
So am I!

905
01:03:03,654 --> 01:03:06,239
Come on, bring him out.

906
01:03:49,783 --> 01:03:51,993
Sit down, Jim.

907
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:57,458
How are you, McKay?

908
01:03:57,499 --> 01:03:59,751
Let's get down to cases, Jim.

909
01:03:59,793 --> 01:04:02,128
You know me and you
know the kind of a man I am.

910
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,255
Yeah.

911
01:04:03,297 --> 01:04:06,151
I don't want to send an
innocent man to his death.

912
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:10,030
As a matter of fact, I'd fight just as hard
to get an innocent man out of here

913
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:12,490
as I would fight to put
a guilty man in here.

914
01:04:12,514 --> 01:04:14,075
All right, I'll vote for you.

915
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:16,578
What are you running for?

916
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:18,812
This is a serious matter, Jim.

917
01:04:18,854 --> 01:04:20,749
It'll pay you to be serious about it.

918
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:23,984
I may be helping to snuff out the life
of an innocent man.

919
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:26,611
You mean you're sorry for railroading me?

920
01:04:26,653 --> 01:04:29,947
Several people have been to see me
about Bob Moran.

921
01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:34,490
He's the man you were going to kill
the night you were caught.

922
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:37,748
I was going to kill?

923
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:40,250
You got me mixed up with somebody.

924
01:04:40,292 --> 01:04:43,920
I make it a point never to kill any Morans.

925
01:04:45,756 --> 01:04:47,984
Then why did you go
to his apartment that night?

926
01:04:48,008 --> 01:04:49,819
I'll bite, why did I?

927
01:04:49,843 --> 01:04:52,530
You tell me, you know everything.

928
01:04:52,554 --> 01:04:54,449
That kind of an attitude won't help you...

929
01:04:54,473 --> 01:04:56,826
I'm not looking for help.

930
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:59,978
When I want your help, I'll let you know.

931
01:05:27,005 --> 01:05:29,007
Do you know this lady?

932
01:05:30,717 --> 01:05:33,863
No, who is she?

933
01:05:33,887 --> 01:05:36,931
Bob Moran is my son.

934
01:05:40,769 --> 01:05:42,979
He's my only child.

935
01:05:46,608 --> 01:05:51,108
I came down here to ask you
to help me to save him.

936
01:05:56,243 --> 01:06:00,080
Well, I guess it's no use, is it?

937
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:03,667
What's the idea of pulling
this sob stuff on me?

938
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:05,794
Just a minute.

939
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:15,738
Oh, Mary.

940
01:06:15,762 --> 01:06:17,221
Oh!

941
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:23,937
Jim, you're not going
through with this, are you?

942
01:06:23,979 --> 01:06:26,940
What are you talking about?

943
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:28,316
I know you, Jim.

944
01:06:28,358 --> 01:06:31,903
You're a killer, but you were always fair.

945
01:06:31,945 --> 01:06:33,655
You were never mean.

946
01:06:33,697 --> 01:06:35,699
You were never cruel.

947
01:06:35,741 --> 01:06:38,452
Have I got to listen
to all this junk, warden?

948
01:06:38,494 --> 01:06:40,871
No, not if you don't want to.

949
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:42,873
You listen to me, Jim.

950
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:45,792
You had Bob framed for that killing.

951
01:06:45,834 --> 01:06:48,044
You said you would get him and you did.

952
01:06:48,086 --> 01:06:50,254
What's the idea?

953
01:06:50,297 --> 01:06:53,383
What are you trying
to frame up on me here?

954
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:04,037
I guess that'll be all, warden.

955
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:05,937
Oh, Mary.

956
01:07:13,946 --> 01:07:17,199
Jim, those two women need that boy.

957
01:07:17,241 --> 01:07:21,741
If there's anything you can say
that will help them, say it now.

958
01:07:24,122 --> 01:07:26,624
Home, James.

959
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:44,244
I don't see how I can
win him off for you folks.

960
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:48,164
You mean,
you mean you won't reopen the case?

961
01:07:48,188 --> 01:07:50,416
There's nothing I can do.

962
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:52,608
The only chance we had
was for him to confess.

963
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:54,277
But it was clear from his attitude.

964
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:57,989
- Surely you could see...
- Attitudes don't count, I'm sorry.

965
01:07:58,031 --> 01:08:00,450
We need evidence.

966
01:08:28,478 --> 01:08:30,813
All right, lock him up!

967
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:00,486
I guess you'd like to get close to Moran,
wouldn't you?

968
01:09:00,510 --> 01:09:02,155
Well, you're not going to!

969
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:03,865
Why not?

970
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:05,098
I wouldn't hurt him.

971
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,909
Not much, you wouldn't.

972
01:09:06,933 --> 01:09:08,703
I can't quite get your angle.

973
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:11,080
Aren't you satisfied he's
going to be executed?

974
01:09:11,104 --> 01:09:12,540
What more do you want?

975
01:09:12,564 --> 01:09:15,650
I don't settle my debts that way.

976
01:09:15,692 --> 01:09:18,277
I'm going to get him myself.

977
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,197
If you ever get any closer to him
than you are right now,

978
01:09:21,239 --> 01:09:23,866
it'll be over my dead body!

979
01:10:03,031 --> 01:10:07,531
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together
here in sight of God

980
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:12,870
and in the face of this company to join together
this man and this woman in holy matrimony,

981
01:10:16,253 --> 01:10:20,753
which is an honorable estate
and is not by any to be entered into

982
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:25,466
unadvisedly or lightly, but reverently.

983
01:10:26,179 --> 01:10:30,679
Into this holy estate, these two
persons present come now to be joined.

984
01:10:31,309 --> 01:10:35,809
If any man can show just cause why
they may not lawfully be joined together,

985
01:10:36,606 --> 01:10:41,106
let him now speak or else hereafter
forever hold his peace.

986
01:10:43,321 --> 01:10:46,907
Wilt thou have this woman
to be thy wedded wife?

987
01:10:46,950 --> 01:10:51,450
Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honor
and keep her in sickness and in health,

988
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:58,082
and forsaking all others, keep thee only
unto her so long as you both shall live?

989
01:11:02,174 --> 01:11:03,651
I Will.

990
01:11:03,675 --> 01:11:06,946
Wilt thou have this man
to be thy wedded husband?

991
01:11:06,970 --> 01:11:11,470
Wilt thou obey him and serve him, love,
honor, and keep him in sickness and in health,

992
01:11:14,102 --> 01:11:18,602
and forsaking all others, keep thee only
unto him so long as you both shall live?

993
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:24,112
I Will.

994
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:28,032
Who giveth this woman
to be married to this man?

995
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:31,619
I do.

996
01:11:34,372 --> 01:11:37,041
Repeat after me.

997
01:11:37,083 --> 01:11:41,583
- With this ring I thee wed.
- With this ring I thee wed.

998
01:11:42,923 --> 01:11:47,423
- And with all my worldly goods, I thee endow.
- And with all my worldly goods, I thee endow.

999
01:11:53,016 --> 01:11:57,516
Those whom God hath joined together,
let no man put asunder.

1000
01:11:58,271 --> 01:12:02,441
I now pronounce you man and wife.

1001
01:12:02,484 --> 01:12:04,235
Oh, my poor children.

1002
01:12:04,277 --> 01:12:06,862
Oh, my poor children!

1003
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:10,116
I'm sorry but your time is up.

1004
01:12:12,118 --> 01:12:13,744
You'll have to go now, Mrs. Moran.

1005
01:12:13,787 --> 01:12:15,246
Oh, my boy!

1006
01:12:15,288 --> 01:12:17,790
Just a minute, warden.

1007
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:24,335
Let me be the first
to give them a wedding present.

1008
01:12:24,923 --> 01:12:28,444
Moran doesn't belong in here.

1009
01:12:28,468 --> 01:12:30,947
They were right.

1010
01:12:30,971 --> 01:12:33,765
I had him framed.

1011
01:12:39,729 --> 01:12:42,208
Jim.

1012
01:12:42,232 --> 01:12:44,234
You keep out of this.

1013
01:12:44,276 --> 01:12:48,776
I'm talking to the warden,
and get away from me

1014
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:52,659
before I change my mind.

1015
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:55,245
What did he say, dear?
What did he say?

1016
01:12:55,287 --> 01:12:58,581
He means that Bob is going to be free now.

1017
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:08,174
You're to blame for this!

1018
01:13:08,216 --> 01:13:11,070
I've been in this racket now for 30 years

1019
01:13:11,094 --> 01:13:14,198
and this is the first time
I ever saw anything like this happen.

1020
01:13:14,222 --> 01:13:17,577
Four hours before an execution!

1021
01:13:17,601 --> 01:13:21,539
Before anything else happens, I'm going
to call up the governor and get a stay.

1022
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:24,524
Maybe you better take my statement first.

1023
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:26,234
I know what to do!

1024
01:13:26,276 --> 01:13:28,486
I've been running a jail all my life.

1025
01:13:28,528 --> 01:13:32,240
Don't you try to teach me my business.

1026
01:13:32,282 --> 01:13:35,535
Come on, you two,
you've just got to go now.

1027
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:37,704
You'll have to leave now, madam.

1028
01:13:40,624 --> 01:13:42,292
I knew you'd come through, Jim.

1029
01:13:42,334 --> 01:13:44,252
Oh, leave me alone.

1030
01:13:44,294 --> 01:13:46,379
Oh, thank you.

1031
01:13:46,421 --> 01:13:49,006
Thank you, Mr. Thunderbolt.

1032
01:14:04,564 --> 01:14:06,649
Go on, close it.

1033
01:14:23,166 --> 01:14:25,251
You've done a wonderful thing, Jim.

1034
01:14:27,462 --> 01:14:30,882
Well, I've been here a long time now

1035
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:35,424
and I'm shuffling off
at the end of the week.

1036
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:40,220
I've had a lot of time
to think things over.

1037
01:14:50,193 --> 01:14:52,195
Better lie down, Bob.

1038
01:14:52,237 --> 01:14:55,114
Try and get some sleep.

1039
01:14:55,156 --> 01:14:56,782
I wanna speak to him.

1040
01:14:56,825 --> 01:14:58,785
I wanna thank him.

1041
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:02,080
I wanna shake his hand.

1042
01:15:02,122 --> 01:15:06,622
We'll shake hands on Saturday when I go.

1043
01:15:10,171 --> 01:15:12,381
Hey, Thunderbolt!

1044
01:15:12,424 --> 01:15:15,069
What's the idea, you going nuts?

1045
01:15:15,093 --> 01:15:18,012
I thought you didn't like that guy!

1046
01:15:25,937 --> 01:15:28,791
A little music, professor.

1047
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:33,315
<i>Summertime, summertime</i>

1048
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:38,195
<i>We will be together in sunny weather</i>

1049
01:15:38,366 --> 01:15:42,703
<i>Down the lane once again</i>

1050
01:15:42,746 --> 01:15:46,875
<i>Sweetheart, you and I!</i>

1051
01:15:46,916 --> 01:15:51,211
<i>Summertime, summertime</i>

1052
01:15:51,254 --> 01:15:55,754
<i>Wedding bells will chime</i>

1053
01:15:56,426 --> 01:15:59,196
<i>All will be sunny</i>

1054
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:01,513
<i>Peaches, cream, and honey</i>

1055
01:16:01,556 --> 01:16:06,056
<i>In the summertime</i>

1056
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:12,983
Aw, now don't argue with me.

1057
01:16:13,026 --> 01:16:17,526
I just left Thunderbolt playing checkers
with Moran and I know what I'm talking about.

1058
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:20,407
He had to get Moran reprieved.

1059
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:24,162
He's always had his mind set on
bumping off this cluck all by his self

1060
01:16:24,204 --> 01:16:27,999
and this is the only way he could do it.

1061
01:16:28,041 --> 01:16:31,252
You guys give me a pain.

1062
01:16:31,294 --> 01:16:33,713
No imagination.

1063
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:40,591
He's gonna wait until they opens up the
door to take him for the last walk, see?

1064
01:16:42,472 --> 01:16:46,869
Then he's gonna go over to say goodbye
to the boyfriend.

1065
01:16:46,893 --> 01:16:48,871
Now, get me.

1066
01:16:48,895 --> 01:16:51,791
I'm Thunderbolt and you're the kid, see?

1067
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:55,544
They opens up the cell door
and starts me for the walk.

1068
01:16:55,568 --> 01:17:00,068
Then I goes over to say goodbye
to the boyfriend.

1069
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:03,952
I sticks out the left hand.

1070
01:17:03,993 --> 01:17:05,285
See, boys?

1071
01:17:05,328 --> 01:17:09,540
This is the minute
that Thunderbolt's been waiting for.

1072
01:17:09,582 --> 01:17:13,961
Well, "80 long, pal," I says.

1073
01:17:14,003 --> 01:17:18,503
And then socko right through the bar.

1074
01:17:32,272 --> 01:17:33,690
All right.

1075
01:17:36,359 --> 01:17:39,195
Hey, wait a minute.

1076
01:17:39,237 --> 01:17:42,156
This invitation is for
last week's execution.

1077
01:17:42,198 --> 01:17:46,698
What do you think we do here,
give out rain checks?

1078
01:17:46,870 --> 01:17:48,162
Out.

1079
01:17:51,624 --> 01:17:53,208
What a heart.

1080
01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:55,294
Good for a hundred years.

1081
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:59,632
It oughta be.

1082
01:17:59,674 --> 01:18:02,259
It's only been jilted once.

1083
01:18:04,345 --> 01:18:07,848
She's Mrs. Moran now.

1084
01:18:22,989 --> 01:18:25,783
Hey, gimme a light, will you, Timothy?

1085
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:34,500
What's the matter, Moran?

1086
01:18:34,542 --> 01:18:39,042
Aren't you happy
now that you're getting out of here?

1087
01:18:39,088 --> 01:18:40,798
I'm not worried about myself.

1088
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:43,652
I'm getting out in a couple of weeks
the warden said.

1089
01:18:43,676 --> 01:18:45,905
I'm worried about you.

1090
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:48,640
Don't you worry about me.

1091
01:18:53,144 --> 01:18:56,457
Hey, Timothy, these clothes don't fit me.

1092
01:18:56,481 --> 01:18:58,083
Take a squint at them.

1093
01:18:58,107 --> 01:19:00,609
How do you think I'm going to look?

1094
01:19:00,652 --> 01:19:03,154
What do you care how you're going to look?

1095
01:19:03,196 --> 01:19:06,032
You're not going anywhere.

1096
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:09,452
And my name is not Timothy!

1097
01:19:09,494 --> 01:19:11,078
Well, don't get sore about it.

1098
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:13,872
I'll guess it before I'm through.

1099
01:19:19,087 --> 01:19:22,882
Come on, boy, we got
a couple of minutes more to play.

1100
01:20:14,017 --> 01:20:18,517
Whereas... give me your attention, Jim.

1101
01:20:18,563 --> 01:20:21,065
Whereas at a trial time on the...

1102
01:20:23,568 --> 01:20:27,280
You don't need to read
that death warrant to me, warden.

1103
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:30,450
I know it backwards.

1104
01:20:30,491 --> 01:20:32,261
- I beg your pardon...
- Don't you bother me now

1105
01:20:32,285 --> 01:20:34,662
when I've got my mind
full of a million details.

1106
01:20:34,704 --> 01:20:36,414
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir, no, sir!

1107
01:20:36,456 --> 01:20:38,207
Yes, sir.

1108
01:20:40,501 --> 01:20:42,669
I knew I'd forgotten something.

1109
01:20:42,712 --> 01:20:43,921
What do you want for lunch?

1110
01:20:43,963 --> 01:20:45,441
You can have anything you want, you know.

1111
01:20:45,465 --> 01:20:47,276
All we've got to do is to bring it in.

1112
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:49,802
Lunch, what time is it?

1113
01:20:49,844 --> 01:20:51,238
Three minutes after eleven.

1114
01:20:51,262 --> 01:20:53,032
What time is the big show?

1115
01:20:53,056 --> 01:20:55,159
11:20.

1116
01:20:55,183 --> 01:20:59,496
So you're going to give
me 17 minutes to eat it, huh?

1117
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:03,208
Well, I'm not going to bolt
my food down in a hurry.

1118
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:07,732
I'd have indigestion all afternoon.

1119
01:21:07,820 --> 01:21:09,780
I'll tell you what I would like to have,
warden.

1120
01:21:09,822 --> 01:21:12,282
Anything within reason, Jim.

1121
01:21:12,325 --> 01:21:14,994
- I'd like to have a good shot of...
- Nothing doing.

1122
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:18,456
The only stuff we've got is in the hospital
and you've got to be sick to get it.

1123
01:21:18,498 --> 01:21:19,582
Well, I'm sick.

1124
01:21:19,624 --> 01:21:21,667
Who's got a better right to be?

1125
01:21:21,709 --> 01:21:23,794
You are sick, aren't you?

1126
01:21:23,836 --> 01:21:26,046
On the level, you don't feel good, do you?

1127
01:21:26,089 --> 01:21:27,882
I feel terrible.

1128
01:21:27,924 --> 01:21:30,527
I feel like I'm going to die.

1129
01:21:30,551 --> 01:21:34,198
Hey, guys, Thunderbolt
says he don't feel so good!

1130
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:36,724
He feels like he's gonna die!

1131
01:21:42,772 --> 01:21:46,275
Well, I'll see what I can do about
getting you a little something.

1132
01:21:51,656 --> 01:21:53,157
How do you feel, Jim?

1133
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:54,325
Same as ever.

1134
01:21:54,367 --> 01:21:56,452
The same as ever?

1135
01:21:56,494 --> 01:21:57,953
Yup.

1136
01:21:57,995 --> 01:22:00,497
You and me can't do any business.

1137
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:04,669
I've lived all my life
without what you stand for

1138
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:08,213
and I guess I'll have to die the same way.

1139
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:12,756
You don't mind my sticking around
in case you change your mind?

1140
01:22:13,136 --> 01:22:15,888
Make yourself right at home.

1141
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:18,033
Hey, Thunderbolt.

1142
01:22:18,057 --> 01:22:22,371
What do you want us to sing
when you're going to your dance?

1143
01:22:22,395 --> 01:22:26,625
I don't know, what have you got?

1144
01:22:26,649 --> 01:22:29,360
Well, how about Brokenhearted?

1145
01:22:29,402 --> 01:22:31,987
That oughta fit you like a glove.

1146
01:22:32,029 --> 01:22:36,158
<i>There she is, my old gal</i>

1147
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:40,700
<i>There he is, my old pal</i>

1148
01:22:40,913 --> 01:22:45,413
<i>And here am I, brokenhearted</i>

1149
01:22:48,129 --> 01:22:50,840
How do you like that?

1150
01:22:50,882 --> 01:22:53,050
That's not so bad.

1151
01:22:55,219 --> 01:22:57,763
How do you like it, Moran?

1152
01:23:10,276 --> 01:23:12,236
Here you are.

1153
01:23:24,081 --> 01:23:26,208
You better take this, warden.

1154
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:28,835
You need it worse than I do.

1155
01:23:36,886 --> 01:23:39,323
I certainly did need it.

1156
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:41,783
You ought to be glad
you haven't got my job.

1157
01:23:41,807 --> 01:23:44,601
You have no idea what I go through.

1158
01:23:57,949 --> 01:23:59,617
Don't you worry, boy.

1159
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:02,536
It's me that's going, not you.

1160
01:24:02,578 --> 01:24:05,122
- Everything all set?
- Yup!

1161
01:24:12,797 --> 01:24:14,673
Let's go.

1162
01:24:24,684 --> 01:24:26,703
So long, Shorty.

1163
01:24:26,727 --> 01:24:27,829
See you soon.

1164
01:24:27,853 --> 01:24:28,997
Thanks, Thunderbolt.

1165
01:24:29,021 --> 01:24:30,374
Send us a postcard.

1166
01:24:30,398 --> 01:24:34,151
Sure, "X marks my room,
wish you were here."

1167
01:24:34,193 --> 01:24:36,820
Jim, aren't you gonna say goodbye to me?

1168
01:24:36,862 --> 01:24:39,155
Me not say goodbye to you?

1169
01:24:39,198 --> 01:24:41,575
I'll be back in a minute, Moran.

1170
01:24:41,617 --> 01:24:44,286
I'm saving you for the last.

1171
01:24:44,328 --> 01:24:48,165
<i>There she is, my old gal</i>

1172
01:24:48,207 --> 01:24:51,835
<i>There he is, my old pal</i>

1173
01:24:51,877 --> 01:24:56,377
<i>And here am I, brokenhearted</i>

1174
01:25:00,303 --> 01:25:04,616
<i>Mine in May, his in June</i>

1175
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:08,495
<i>She forgot mighty soon</i>

1176
01:25:08,519 --> 01:25:12,291
<i>And here am I, right here</i>

1177
01:25:12,315 --> 01:25:16,068
<i>Brokenhearted</i>

1178
01:25:16,152 --> 01:25:20,614
<i>The last time that we said goodbye</i>

1179
01:25:20,656 --> 01:25:24,534
<i>I knew that she was through</i>

1180
01:25:24,577 --> 01:25:29,077
<i>It's bad enough that I lost her</i>

1181
01:25:29,206 --> 01:25:33,706
<i>I had to lose him too</i>

1182
01:25:33,961 --> 01:25:38,423
<i>There they go, feel their joy</i>

1183
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:42,779
<i>Happy girl, lucky boy</i>

1184
01:25:42,803 --> 01:25:47,303
<i>And here am I</i>

1185
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:52,142
<i>Brokenhearted</i>

1186
01:25:59,528 --> 01:26:02,531
So long, pal.

1187
01:26:02,573 --> 01:26:06,243
I wish I could help you now, Jim,
the way you helped me.

1188
01:26:13,876 --> 01:26:18,005
Funny, sizing us two up,

1189
01:26:18,047 --> 01:26:22,547
nobody would ever think
you were the better man.

1190
01:26:23,427 --> 01:26:25,572
You're the better man, Jim.

1191
01:26:25,596 --> 01:26:28,116
You've taught me a let
these last couple of days.

1192
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:32,640
You'll be seeing Ritzie soon,
won't you, Moran?

1193
01:26:36,315 --> 01:26:40,815
She's a great little girl, isn't she?

1194
01:26:41,153 --> 01:26:45,653
You were pretty lucky
to take her away from me, weren't you?

1195
01:26:46,617 --> 01:26:49,745
I didn't mean to tell you, Jim,
but I guess I will.

1196
01:26:49,787 --> 01:26:51,997
Somehow I think you ought to know.

1197
01:26:52,039 --> 01:26:53,832
I oughta know what?

1198
01:26:53,874 --> 01:26:56,585
I didn't take her away from you, Jim.

1199
01:26:56,627 --> 01:26:59,504
It was you that took her away from me.

1200
01:27:04,510 --> 01:27:07,155
I took her away from you?

1201
01:27:07,179 --> 01:27:11,679
We've always been sweethearts,
since we were kids, and then she met you.

1202
01:27:12,601 --> 01:27:16,498
I didn't amount to much
and she thought you were wonderful.

1203
01:27:16,522 --> 01:27:21,022
She never told me anything about that.

1204
01:27:23,195 --> 01:27:26,198
I guess I was nothing to brag about.

1205
01:27:32,163 --> 01:27:36,663
I always did have a peculiar habit of
taking things that didn't belong to me.

1206
01:27:40,004 --> 01:27:42,589
That's why I'm here.

1207
01:27:53,225 --> 01:27:57,725
You're kinda crazy about her, aren't you?

1208
01:27:57,855 --> 01:28:01,042
I love her, Jim.

1209
01:28:01,066 --> 01:28:05,566
Well, I guess I do too.

1210
01:28:05,696 --> 01:28:08,365
I still do.

1211
01:28:20,169 --> 01:28:21,795
Good luck, kid.

1212
01:28:21,837 --> 01:28:24,089
Good luck to you both.

1213
01:28:24,131 --> 01:28:27,134
Give her my love.

1214
01:28:27,176 --> 01:28:30,304
And take care of her, whatever you do.

1215
01:28:54,912 --> 01:28:59,412
Well, chaplain,
I might as well give you a break too.

1216
01:28:59,875 --> 01:29:01,918
Come on.

1217
01:29:27,736 --> 01:29:30,029
So long, old timer.

1218
01:29:30,072 --> 01:29:33,241
And don't take any wooden biscuits.

1219
01:29:39,039 --> 01:29:41,124
Hey, Dinty.

1220
01:29:41,166 --> 01:29:45,420
Come here, will ya,
and give me one more light?

1221
01:30:01,770 --> 01:30:04,791
Here, Dinty, I guess I'll quit smoking.

1222
01:30:04,815 --> 01:30:08,193
Thanks, and my name isn't Dinty.

1223
01:30:08,235 --> 01:30:12,322
And before you go, I want you to know
that my name is Aloysius

1224
01:30:12,364 --> 01:30:14,324
and you didn't guess it.

1225
01:30:16,076 --> 01:30:18,995
- Your name is what?
- Aloysius.

1226
01:30:22,458 --> 01:30:24,751
What did you say your name was?

1227
01:30:24,793 --> 01:30:27,754
Aloysius and you didn't guess it.

1228
01:30:31,342 --> 01:30:33,987
Who would've guessed it?

1229
01:30:34,011 --> 01:30:35,804
<i>No...</i>

1230
01:30:46,857 --> 01:30:48,984
He said...
