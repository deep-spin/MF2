00:09:56,44 --> 00:09:58,18
What you guys had me come on and go on.

76
00:10:04,86 --> 00:10:07,46
The

77
00:10:07,47 --> 00:10:12,75
Earth's.

78
00:10:13,96 --> 00:10:16,01
The poor

79
00:10:16,42 --> 00:10:25,42
the

80
00:10:25,43 --> 00:10:31,98
you think that. For

81
00:10:31,99 --> 00:10:33,96
a minute I thought I lost the magic touch.

82
00:10:59,45 --> 00:11:05,72
But is a value. Of them. Are
you guys kidding with I talk

83
00:11:05,73 --> 00:11:12,43

a chance I only did just control. The

86
00:11:46,19 --> 00:11:51,28
gently trouble. Everything's perfect you
act like it's something bothering you and

87
00:11:51,29 --> 00:11:51,46

00:11:51,47 --> 00:11:57,17
a big I told you everything was perfect

89
00:11:58,41 --> 00:11:58,55
Is

90
00:11:58,56 --> 00:12:05,80
a. Thing as won't bother anybody anymore

91
00:12:06,48 --> 00:12:09,70
you're going to say you got rid of him
without letting me have the body you can't

92
00:12:09,71 --> 00:12:15,77
do that to me. Seems he can do
anything he pleases. Didn't you get

93
00:12:15,78 --> 00:12:19,51
a big enough cut in this last
job. I've been about this.

94
00:12:23,07 --> 00:12:23,69
Thing is was

95
00:12:23,70 --> 00:12:29,71

rid of us in the same way I wouldn't do

96

loving. Oh I didn't.

102
00:13:08,49 --> 00:13:13,57
Know about feeding the hungry has been
like need earning and I have it I see this

103
00:13:13,58 --> 00:13:17,06
morning. And I give us

104
00:13:17,07 --> 00:13:23,09
a prize for you who. You think your book.

00:13:25,93 --> 00:13:30,52
On another person. To
remind you of my love.

106
00:13:33,40 --> 00:13:38,81
Of. The beautiful just like you made it.

107
00:13:42,07 --> 00:13:48,18
With the must have cost me off I
have. Nothing is too good for you.

108
00:13:49,50 --> 00:13:55,45
In the. House in your thought
to give me such expensive gifts

109
00:13:56,47 --> 00:14:03,42
and so on. What better use could I put the
money from I. Should save your money.

110
00:14:05,72 --> 00:14:09,73
Not yours I want you your companionship.

111
00:14:14,80 --> 00:14:21,63
Really. I get so in order for the time. Why
do you have to stay away from me night

112
00:14:21,64 --> 00:14:28,57
after night how much are we going
on like. Maybe. The search for my

113
00:14:28,58 --> 00:14:32,20
new book will be finished
soon and then we go away.

114
00:14:46,57 --> 00:14:53,57
Honestly is it. Odd or nothing

115
00:14:53,58 --> 00:15:00,39
more and they are right nice cool
fresh. Water. Every morning for

116
00:15:00,40 --> 00:15:06,11
three years you start out with the same
stimulating conversation. Sometimes I think

117
00:15:06,12 --> 00:15:12,37
out great. You.

118
00:15:16,52 --> 00:15:19,24
The poor. Old.

119
00:15:27,39 --> 00:15:30,67
Series of robberies is
definitely the work of

120
00:15:30,68 --> 00:15:36,46
a homicidal maniac. Leaving the body of
an accomplice on the job prove that.

121
00:15:40,69 --> 00:15:47,52
So if you. Are the bank full of men are
concerned they better be on their toes

122
00:15:48,25 --> 00:15:51,87
or they'll find themselves
like I don't know. That's all.

123
00:16:04,70 --> 00:16:11,01
Sure let me off they might make you
ever see an Irishman. This is the suit

124
00:16:11,78 --> 00:16:16,55
you start drawing that comes in that's my
go to get up in the history time but of

125
00:16:16,56 --> 00:16:19,39
course it would be nice to be on the
phone without those kids yelling teaches

126
00:16:19,40 --> 00:16:25,22
a class kid. How I love. You know
Mark Some day I'm going to have

127
00:16:25,23 --> 00:16:30,85
a test. But you know you have to
get really first which is. I am

128
00:16:30,86 --> 00:16:34,67
a fire for get that promotion
you loose and you'll be

129
00:16:34,68 --> 00:16:39,77
a detective before you know. When
that happens I'm going to find

130
00:16:39,78 --> 00:16:45,59
a place in the country just like you work
in the garden. You know you have no idea

131
00:16:46,10 --> 00:16:46,58
I'll be in

132
00:16:46,59 --> 00:17:02,78
a detective will have to pitch
they will go. Along Mark. Study

133
00:17:02,79 --> 00:17:07,41
of abnormal psychology recognizes paranoia
as one of the most dangerous types of

134
00:17:07,42 --> 00:17:13,32
insanity perhaps most of them is I'm coming
from the glass why it's so dangerous

135
00:17:13,61 --> 00:17:17,74
Well the patient suffers from delusions
of grandeur he thinks he's very important

136
00:17:18,33 --> 00:17:20,47
way above those around him he has

137
00:17:20,48 --> 00:17:26,79
a superiority complex that's all oh it's
also coupled with the persecution mania

138
00:17:27,46 --> 00:17:33,53
caused by an intense feeling that everyone's
against him so you're connected to him

139
00:17:33,54 --> 00:17:40,37
explained why the chief justice. Well I
guess is because the act the logical way if

140
00:17:40,38 --> 00:17:44,74
you didn't study and you would know it was
now I just. And he doesn't hesitate to

141
00:17:44,75 --> 00:17:51,12
use force to assert his personality. This
leads to an anti-social conduct that Mr

142
00:17:51,13 --> 00:17:55,40
Dennison I think if you
apply the might even enjoy

143
00:17:55,44 --> 00:18:02,31
a life of crime. It's
common my school needs

144
00:18:02,32 --> 00:18:06,16
a wall at the jail but this time the
feet on the over the bridge it is.

145
00:18:07,66 --> 00:18:10,20
The

146
00:18:10,21 --> 00:18:15,56
view

147
00:18:15,57 --> 00:18:24,79
the

148
00:18:24,80 --> 00:18:26,51
of what that which frankly moves.

149
00:18:34,32 --> 00:18:38,99
The mind repeat it up to
him is your promotion.

150
00:18:46,89 --> 00:18:49,86
The

151
00:18:49,87 --> 00:18:57,12
vote

152
00:18:57,13 --> 00:19:07,95
the

153
00:19:07,96 --> 00:19:11,80
you're the

154
00:19:11,84 --> 00:19:17,23
the with

155
00:19:17,24 --> 00:19:20,82
the the world

156
00:19:21,43 --> 00:19:26,49
the the.

157
00:19:31,78 --> 00:19:34,21
I was not uncovered yet
make up much right away.

158
00:19:38,20 --> 00:19:43,05
Holy. I

159
00:19:43,06 --> 00:19:48,37
don't.

160
00:20:02,94 --> 00:20:09,80
I think I mean. I'm sorry Mr
Wagner I didn't mean to disturb

161
00:20:09,81 --> 00:20:16,76
you. I thought I could tell she was
guarding the supplies you need to get

162
00:20:16,77 --> 00:20:23,30
them the goddess because. Those
unfortunates all depend on. You.

163
00:20:24,55 --> 00:20:27,27
I thought you said that right
I'll attend to it once.

164
00:20:50,97 --> 00:20:51,05
And.

165
00:21:00,08 --> 00:21:06,63
The let me take care of it I think. It
might be coming. Let me clean it then.

166
00:21:10,09 --> 00:21:15,07
Don't worry I'm just. Not going.

167
00:21:22,10 --> 00:21:24,04
To. Come on.

168
00:21:30,81 --> 00:21:31,32
Down here.

169
00:21:42,45 --> 00:21:47,80
Either. That I sliced with and
I've got to take my do. Then.

170
00:21:56,76 --> 00:21:57,51
It will seem just

171
00:21:57,52 --> 00:22:04,11
a little bit. There that didn't hurt
much does it don't hurt at all.

172
00:22:06,61 --> 00:22:09,28
That it had. Let me know when you get to.

173
00:22:25,30 --> 00:22:31,50
This. There's my thought since up
there that if you can't read minds.

174
00:22:54,18 --> 00:22:54,32
Take

175
00:22:54,33 --> 00:23:03,66
a look in the pool. And

176
00:23:04,10 --> 00:23:06,69
what can I do for you if your mouth shut.

177
00:23:12,10 --> 00:23:16,80

00:23:27,83 --> 00:23:34,06
Somebody. I did not say
you. Yes Who is the ass.

180
00:23:36,42 --> 00:23:41,29
Just some old. Seething type.

181
00:23:50,66 --> 00:23:54,47
Beside you make a habit of giving
that there are a lot or just

182
00:23:54,48 --> 00:24:01,18
a precaution otherwise my guess would
be all over the place. Is that

183
00:24:01,19 --> 00:24:05,90
something awful. Happens and I just kill
or live somewhere in the neighborhood is

184
00:24:05,94 --> 00:24:08,23
the get out of the search
always bothered places.

185
00:24:14,07 --> 00:24:17,86
I'd be glad to surely get out myself just

186
00:24:17,87 --> 00:24:20,87
a dog so I believe I see
what you can find of.

187
00:24:35,01 --> 00:24:39,08
The police is looking for someone who
thought they might be hiding kids is

188
00:24:39,09 --> 00:24:42,86
a young fellow by the name of Frank e-mail
about twenty three years old medium

189
00:24:42,87 --> 00:24:45,70
height and dark hair baby face. By

190
00:24:45,83 --> 00:24:52,57
a man of that. He was. I think I
Then he didn't even know where to

191
00:24:52,58 --> 00:24:59,52
go. Thank you. I know about

192
00:24:59,53 --> 00:25:03,58
after you get your eyes off them again not
if I believe that what is needed like

193
00:25:03,74 --> 00:25:07,16
suddenly I'd be happy to cooperate
with the police I'd like.

194
00:25:21,04 --> 00:25:27,62
And. What not. But I can leave now.

195
00:25:32,32 --> 00:25:33,08
I'll be home in about

196
00:25:33,09 --> 00:25:41,38

you saw the need for God I have

198
00:25:48,16 --> 00:25:51,51
a proposition that think
you will like. It.

199
00:25:59,39 --> 00:26:05,66
You do make this stuff. This is evidence
that this isn't the mind and the power

200
00:26:05,67 --> 00:26:11,84
mind that might help me. With
this with that just my household.

201
00:26:15,98 --> 00:26:20,91
And I. Then today I do that.

202
00:26:25,45 --> 00:26:32,42
How would you like to join my organization.
One of my associates downstairs

203
00:26:32,93 --> 00:26:39,29

00:27:10,44 --> 00:27:16,48

needed. It seems we all have our little.

208

Of it you think you. You wouldn't believe
it's laughable but I am afraid of you.

I'd do to keep the cats on this

218
00:28:45,16 --> 00:28:51,83
equating my grace. Is with the
outtakes nothing to do. That work.

219
00:28:54,20 --> 00:29:00,20
Just to get. Along but
the guy really got that.

220
00:29:03,76 --> 00:29:04,04

00:29:04,05 --> 00:29:15,41
a great doctor. He just. Just

222
00:29:15,42 --> 00:29:18,47

any moment now. Always late liking to be
on time just once you know it you know

227
00:29:54,74 --> 00:29:59,84
he's not and is not wrong. With
Melbourne when you're going to put

228
00:29:59,85 --> 00:30:04,47
a stop to all that why can't you stay away
from that place after all if you you're

229
00:30:04,48 --> 00:30:09,33
the one that can make her understand things
and those with their eye surgeon you

230
00:30:09,34 --> 00:30:14,54
can feel her which is more important you
are that Karl or whatever his name is

231
00:30:14,55 --> 00:30:21,09

Bowery. I'll try. To do my

232
00:30:21,10 --> 00:30:26,16
dear boy. To make me the
happiest woman in the word.

233
00:30:30,87 --> 00:30:37,81
Duty. Maybe I believe today.

You know. Please about this one take
very little but if you could tell me how

237
00:30:54,98 --> 00:30:58,25
important to the I I want
you to give up that So

238
00:30:58,26 --> 00:31:03,36
a job saving it's ridiculous not because
I could spend the rest of my life when

239
00:31:03,37 --> 00:31:07,12
you're not one might ask and
so much considering that it's

240
00:31:07,13 --> 00:31:11,63
a very much sort of thing that I don't want
my future wife wasting her time enough

241

already. As a boy has be a good to

242

tell my mother I think about having all

243
00:31:22,41 --> 00:31:27,89
those nations. See now how you
feel about it but forget it.

244
00:31:35,95 --> 00:31:42,77
I'm sorry I didn't. I guess it's
just because I'm into tired it's

245
00:31:42,78 --> 00:31:48,41
just that you stop working down at the
mission and Six-Pack of yourself. Do you

246
00:31:48,45 --> 00:31:55,22
realize you're giving up your friends your
social life everything or was. It the

247
00:31:55,23 --> 00:31:59,70
opportunity of helping underprivileged. You
should be proud of you for that region

248
00:31:59,70 --> 00:32:04,91
. For working in the
power. Of the place for

249
00:32:04,92 --> 00:32:11,80
a girl like you and that's why good

00:32:11,81 --> 00:32:18,06
like to meet him and. You and
Mr Wegg to come. Up to you.

251
00:32:22,74 --> 00:32:27,29

252
00:32:27,30 --> 00:32:33,30
spending half the night down. You've no
idea let me use during the fun I have been

00:34:08,32 --> 00:34:14,16
a question if I may suddenly. About my
term paper I suddenly realise that I know

263
00:34:14,17 --> 00:34:20,95
very little about real people. What gave
you that idea. You can't learn about life

264
00:34:20,96 --> 00:34:23,98
cruising around. The I
was thinking of writing

265
00:34:23,99 --> 00:34:27,66
a man thinks just before
he died. That the I'm

266
00:34:27,67 --> 00:34:31,96
a scientific that's what I mean but with
your permission I'd like to change to

267
00:34:31,97 --> 00:34:36,73
a paper feel qualified to handle it by
all means make that the subject like

268
00:34:36,74 --> 00:34:37,34

00:34:51,81 --> 00:34:58,76
your shield. And my share. Of the time

271
00:34:58,77 --> 00:35:04,42
judging by the coverage you get on the
retard that. Led to the she'll be given to

272
00:35:04,43 --> 00:35:10,05
you. Because you know your
first assignment but I do.

00:43:57,18 --> 00:44:03,48
that. But from time to pick you
said yourself you can't ask

343
00:44:03,49 --> 00:44:10,48
a dead man but you can ask
yourself if so then. You must be

344
00:44:10,49 --> 00:44:17,45
joking. Thinking you know it
doesn't joke. Do you think. You

345
00:44:17,46 --> 00:44:20,10
can't be serious this is like

346
00:44:20,11 --> 00:44:26,99
a crazy nightmare think. You have thirty
seconds plans of that question I'm

347
00:44:27,00 --> 00:44:31,28
getting out of here. I'm
afraid not but then it's

348
00:44:31,29 --> 00:44:38,24
a. Big. Please Professor what
are you thinking you're mad

349
00:44:38,32 --> 00:44:40,94
insane I think so.

350
00:44:48,69 --> 00:44:49,11
Your buck.

351
00:45:06,36 --> 00:45:12,95
Our. Only. If you have them
and they knew compel you

352
00:45:12,99 --> 00:45:13,37
to.

353
00:45:20,71 --> 00:45:26,82
Do the. Time is one of only nine o'clock
I want you because Mrs Dennistoun

354
00:45:27,67 --> 00:45:31,26
with you didn't come home at night and
the whole family friendly they thought

355
00:45:31,27 --> 00:45:38,08
perhaps you might seem as if. You.
Wasn't listed in the dream and

356
00:45:38,09 --> 00:45:45,05
mission trail that you did them.
Nevertheless is true when I call back

357
00:45:45,12 --> 00:45:51,08
and you talk to. Them why she said. I mean

358
00:45:51,65 --> 00:45:56,31
doesn't mean every night you've been
missing for years. Is excited over them.

359
00:46:01,90 --> 00:46:06,83
I'm. Just. I just want to tell
you not to worry about which.

360
00:46:09,04 --> 00:46:14,51
Yet you do research in the
dialect of children. All of

361
00:46:14,52 --> 00:46:21,18
a. Hope you are so you are right the place
like that could possibly happen to him

362
00:46:21,19 --> 00:46:27,45
down there. I don't think that's. Just.

363
00:46:29,64 --> 00:46:33,75
Because according to Richard. So we did.

364
00:46:40,25 --> 00:46:40,60
Welcome.

365
00:46:46,98 --> 00:46:48,61
Young don't explain why he came to

366
00:46:48,62 --> 00:46:55,30
a mission. That enticed me to
quit but I. Mean that's not

367
00:46:55,95 --> 00:47:01,81
how well you know this fella that runs the
mission crowd way like. I do us because

368
00:47:01,82 --> 00:47:06,38
Dennis and Frank e-mails were last seen in
Wagner's mission with the hero you don't

369
00:47:06,39 --> 00:47:11,40
suspect that Mr Wagner had anything to do
with the disappearance I don't know but I

370
00:47:11,41 --> 00:47:16,20
intend to find out. What it grew
up around to Mr Wagner right away.

371
00:47:18,72 --> 00:47:25,33
Where are they doing that. The captain vigil
could something be done about it right

372
00:47:25,34 --> 00:47:30,86
away by doing everything as humanly
possible this time. But I was wrong in this

373
00:47:30,87 --> 00:47:35,62
case after and it's all right I'd like to
take time he was going up but when you

374
00:47:35,63 --> 00:47:42,56

375
00:47:42,57 --> 00:47:44,24

00:47:51,73 --> 00:47:57,87
Let him know. When he puti to do you know.

building. That the street from

381
00:48:26,16 --> 00:48:26,81

Detective Crawford quickly check what I

383

385
00:48:40,25 --> 00:48:40,81

00:49:36,74 --> 00:49:43,68
a piece come in when I guess. I
must protect the property and

395
00:49:43,69 --> 00:49:43,98
this is

396
00:49:43,99 --> 00:49:48,36
a fact it's not true and I'll be alarmed
we have nearly one question the professor

397
00:49:48,37 --> 00:49:52,68
have I thought of it too. He
wanted to be seated like you.

398
00:50:02,63 --> 00:50:07,39
It's. Just yet another
you say don't you think.

399
00:50:13,37 --> 00:50:19,48
I'm some. Of the standard.

400
00:50:21,76 --> 00:50:24,43
That's Carl Wagner down in the bog.

reason to suspect your husband of leading

402
00:50:38,66 --> 00:50:43,91
a double life. To keep. My
husband at the same time.

403
00:50:45,61 --> 00:50:50,13

also known as Karl Wagner and he operates

404
00:50:50,14 --> 00:50:56,78
a mission on the Bowery where Richard
Dunne of the most life thing. And we have

405
00:50:56,79 --> 00:51:00,01
reason to believe that he's using the
place to cover criminal activities.

406
00:51:12,11 --> 00:51:19,02
That he thinks is not
enough to some. And to him.

407
00:51:21,98 --> 00:51:23,17
And those hurdles are not.

408
00:51:29,94 --> 00:51:32,23
