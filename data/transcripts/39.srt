1
00:00:44,886 --> 00:00:46,911
Excited, Pete?

2
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:49,155
About what?

3
00:00:49,324 --> 00:00:51,189
Aboput the fact that you
are going to be...

4
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,055
...uno de los hombres más 
importantes del pais esta noche.

5
00:00:55,396 --> 00:00:57,125
- ¿Piensas eso?
- ¿Piensas eso?

6
00:00:57,298 --> 00:00:59,960
After 25 years ruling
the underworld...

7
00:01:00,134 --> 00:01:03,865
...Benny Costain, el hombre más
poderoso y temido del pais,...

8
00:01:04,038 --> 00:01:07,633
...será procesado gracias
a Pete Tonelli.

9
00:01:07,809 --> 00:01:10,004
¿Sabe lo que hace Costain...

10
00:01:10,178 --> 00:01:12,237
...a los que intentan delatarle?

11
00:01:12,413 --> 00:01:14,506
Después de su testimonio...

12
00:01:14,682 --> 00:01:17,082
...no estará aquí 
para hacer nada, Pete.

13
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:19,082
Yeah.

14
00:01:19,253 --> 00:01:21,016
Maybe.

15
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:25,350
Maybe I'm gonna be on the stand.

16
00:01:25,526 --> 00:01:27,084
Why, sure you are, Pete.

17
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:29,354
You're gonna get on the stand.

18
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,829
And we'll see to it that nothing
happens to you after you do.

19
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:34,263
We sure will.

20
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:28,115
Oh, now, look, kid, it isn't so bad.

21
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:30,273
See if you can't think of this joint...

22
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:34,080
...as a sort of a training ground
for future life.

23
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,246
Of course, training for what
beats me.

24
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:39,018
But I've never been in prison before.

25
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,494
Half the time, I don't know
what they're saying.

26
00:03:42,663 --> 00:03:44,756
Because I don't know,
I do something wrong.

27
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:48,766
- Then they yell at me like I'm stupid.
- Okay, kid, so now you can relax.

28
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:51,905
You finally got your first break
since they dragged you in.

29
00:03:52,073 --> 00:03:54,405
- Break?
- Certainly, they turned you over to me.

30
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:58,306
I happen to know more about this joint
than those grafters that built it.

31
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,037
Yeah, but I don't.

32
00:04:00,214 --> 00:04:03,206
Okay, so you don't.
So I'm gonna tell you.

33
00:04:03,384 --> 00:04:07,320
Certain things in the beginning is
more important to know than others.

34
00:04:07,488 --> 00:04:09,979
And other things is
even more important than that.

35
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:12,888
And one of the most important things
in this place...

36
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,085
...is, don't volunteer for nothing.

37
00:04:15,563 --> 00:04:17,758
- Don't volunteer?
- Now, remember that.

38
00:04:17,932 --> 00:04:21,732
When they come, wagging their tails
and trying to act warm and friendly...

39
00:04:21,903 --> 00:04:25,839
...about some extra work that's gotta
be done, you don't do nothing.

40
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:28,202
You just sit there,
like a hunk of wet wash.

41
00:04:28,376 --> 00:04:30,606
And don't volunteer.

42
00:04:30,878 --> 00:04:32,140
Why not?

43
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,144
Why should you help the jerks out...

44
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,182
...that's keeping you here,
for one thing?

45
00:04:37,351 --> 00:04:42,687
And don't ever do one bit more than
just exactly what you're told to do.

46
00:04:43,891 --> 00:04:45,518
But how do you get around them?

47
00:04:45,693 --> 00:04:49,185
Okay. Supposing they come to me,
and they say:

48
00:04:49,363 --> 00:04:52,696
"Conley, on this floor,
there's a spot."

49
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:55,802
Do I go ahead and wet-mop
from here to extremity?

50
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,232
Not you.

51
00:04:58,272 --> 00:05:00,240
Not on your life, I don't.

52
00:05:00,408 --> 00:05:02,342
And I don't go over that floor...

53
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,377
...except just where they point out
it's spotty exactly.

54
00:05:05,546 --> 00:05:08,037
And what do we usually say
about that?

55
00:05:08,216 --> 00:05:11,674
You usually say, "Don't you have
no brains, Conley?

56
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,822
Don't you know we meant
to clean the whole filthy floor?"

57
00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:17,219
That always gives Conley
a chance to say...

58
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:20,326
"If I had any brains,
what would I be doing in this trap?"

59
00:05:20,494 --> 00:05:22,826
Come on, you're wanted
in the warden's office.

60
00:05:22,997 --> 00:05:24,726
The warden's office?

61
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:27,993
For what? It's just about time
for the dinner to gong.

62
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:30,000
Now, don't show off, Conley.

63
00:05:30,171 --> 00:05:31,729
Come on.

64
00:05:31,906 --> 00:05:34,704
Like poor, dumb sheep, we're
moved from barn to stall...

65
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,639
...and nobody tells us why.

66
00:05:36,811 --> 00:05:38,574
It's inhuman.

67
00:05:38,746 --> 00:05:41,408
Don't volunteer for nothing.

68
00:05:41,582 --> 00:05:43,345
This way.

69
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:03,630
When we're thrown off schedule...

70
00:06:03,804 --> 00:06:06,967
...you can't blame our stomachs
for growling a little.

71
00:06:11,712 --> 00:06:13,145
Hello, Conley.

72
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:17,045
As I understand it, Conley will
remain in our custody even though...

73
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:19,914
...you'll take her outside the prison?
- That's right.

74
00:06:20,087 --> 00:06:23,545
- Get her into her street clothes.
- Yes, ma'am.

75
00:06:23,724 --> 00:06:25,123
Anything wrong?

76
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:27,557
If there was,
I'd be the last one to be told.

77
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:29,218
That will do, Conley.

78
00:06:29,397 --> 00:06:34,164
I don't suppose it'd do any good if I
ask if my civil rights is being violated.

79
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:37,463
I have a court order to give you
to the federal authorities.

80
00:06:37,638 --> 00:06:39,902
In an unfed condition?

81
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:42,668
We won't be long, lieutenant.

82
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,846
This time, the inmate's stomach
is not to be blamed.

83
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,963
Four years of too many potatoes,
Conley.

84
00:07:09,136 --> 00:07:14,301
Potatoes? I thought those were
plastic cotton balls they were testing.

85
00:08:49,837 --> 00:08:51,771
Look out, will you?

86
00:09:07,288 --> 00:09:10,655
Would you mind telling me
what this is all...?

87
00:09:16,297 --> 00:09:18,322
Nobody talks to me.

88
00:09:35,816 --> 00:09:39,843
Well, aren't we the real life-size
Boston Blackies.

89
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,925
Why? Why?

90
00:10:04,678 --> 00:10:06,077
Help yourself.

91
00:10:06,247 --> 00:10:08,010
Thanks.

92
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,092
Hey, look at them new styles!

93
00:10:22,096 --> 00:10:27,432
I guess maybe these old rags of mine
must look like Easter parade in 1902.

94
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:31,059
Sister, I wouldn't know styles
if you shoved them down my throat.

95
00:10:31,238 --> 00:10:32,500
You're sure of that, huh?

96
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,870
Why? Because you had so many
of them shoved down your throat?

97
00:10:37,044 --> 00:10:40,207
Why is it nobody ever thought
of building a nice, big statue...

98
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:43,748
...to the first cop who ever called
a girl "sister"?

99
00:10:43,918 --> 00:10:45,943
Because if he hadn't come along...

100
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,578
...the police would sure put on
their bare faces for small talk.

101
00:10:50,224 --> 00:10:53,091
What's it with a cop?
Always gotta call you "sister."

102
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,522
You like "mother" better?

103
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,061
Maybe I'd like my own name
for a change.

104
00:10:57,231 --> 00:11:00,394
- Maybe you would.
- Yeah, try it for size.

105
00:11:05,306 --> 00:11:07,706
Oh, look! Polka dots!

106
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,400
Look at that dress in the window!

107
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:16,341
I hope you don't object to a person
looking out their own window.

108
00:11:16,517 --> 00:11:19,748
You'll know right away
if I object to anything.

109
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,753
What'll you do, light up?

110
00:12:24,918 --> 00:12:27,785
Would the world collapse
if somebody told me something?

111
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,855
Somebody will.

112
00:12:36,096 --> 00:12:37,529
Clayton.

113
00:12:39,533 --> 00:12:41,091
- Whole floor cleared?
- Yes, sir.

114
00:12:41,268 --> 00:12:44,294
- How about the roof?
- The men are already up there.

115
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,003
What are we gonna have, a party?

116
00:13:23,444 --> 00:13:25,435
What kind of prisoners
do you keep here?

117
00:13:25,612 --> 00:13:28,604
Willoughby, get her settled.
I'll be back in a minute.

118
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,675
You didn't tell her anything?

119
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,686
What about the trip here?
You sure you weren't followed?

120
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,416
I'm sure I was. I lost them.

121
00:13:38,592 --> 00:13:40,856
- You're positive?
- Please.

122
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:42,393
All right.

123
00:13:42,563 --> 00:13:44,463
What's she like, Vince?

124
00:13:44,631 --> 00:13:47,099
Just like the rest that come
through the lineup.

125
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:50,759
Smart-talking, brassy,
third-class citizen.

126
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:52,997
And she's our last chance.

127
00:13:53,173 --> 00:13:56,802
If she doesn't come through,
we'll be thrown out of court Monday...

128
00:13:56,977 --> 00:13:58,706
...and there goes two years' work.

129
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,077
Then she ought to be in the city jail,
where Costain can't knock her off.

130
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,741
Let's do it my way.

131
00:14:13,827 --> 00:14:16,694
- What's so interesting?
- People.

132
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,493
And cars.

133
00:14:18,665 --> 00:14:21,634
But mostly people who can go
anyplace they wanna go.

134
00:14:23,537 --> 00:14:25,835
Haven't seen anybody like that
for four years.

135
00:14:26,006 --> 00:14:28,236
- Who's that?
- My daughter.

136
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,310
- Are you married?
- I was.

137
00:14:33,347 --> 00:14:35,781
He died in France,
in the Normandy landings.

138
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,351
None of us never knew that.

139
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:44,691
It must scare you to have a daughter
with a job like yours...

140
00:14:44,858 --> 00:14:47,486
...that always points out
what can happen to a girl.

141
00:14:47,661 --> 00:14:50,027
And she's pretty.

142
00:14:52,533 --> 00:14:56,526
Pretty lucky kid to have a mother
like you that's so crazy about her.

143
00:14:56,703 --> 00:15:00,969
Of course, I am crazy about her,
but how did you know?

144
00:15:01,141 --> 00:15:04,008
You should've seen your look
when I said she was pretty.

145
00:15:04,178 --> 00:15:06,476
Willoughby, send her in here.

146
00:15:06,647 --> 00:15:08,615
I guess they want you in there now.

147
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,044
For what?

148
00:15:10,217 --> 00:15:13,983
I don't know any more than you do,
but you'd better go.

149
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:23,255
You don't, huh?

150
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,665
We arrived at the place
where you'll explain...

151
00:15:28,836 --> 00:15:31,327
...this dragging of a person
from here to there?

152
00:15:31,505 --> 00:15:34,906
Yes, we've finally arrived
at that place, Miss Conley.

153
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:37,009
Would you please sit down?

154
00:15:39,012 --> 00:15:40,843
My name is Lloyd Hallett.

155
00:15:41,014 --> 00:15:42,845
I'm an attorney for the government.

156
00:15:43,016 --> 00:15:45,041
You mean I'm up
for some kind of tax rap?

157
00:15:45,219 --> 00:15:49,713
No, you're not up for any kind
of raps, so you can just relax.

158
00:15:50,724 --> 00:15:53,022
Would you care for a cigarette?

159
00:15:58,966 --> 00:16:01,230
One for later, after dinner.

160
00:16:01,401 --> 00:16:02,663
Certainly.

161
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:06,067
We thought you could be helpful
by giving us some information...

162
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,403
...about a case that I'm prosecuting.

163
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:13,744
Case? What I know about cases,
you can put on the head of a pin.

164
00:16:13,914 --> 00:16:17,008
- Perhaps I can be a bit more explicit.
- You do that.

165
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:21,086
You used to go around with a man
named Pete Tonelli, didn't you?

166
00:16:21,255 --> 00:16:24,918
Go around? You mean, like
merry-go-rounds and revolving doors?

167
00:16:25,492 --> 00:16:27,983
I mean, you used to be
a friend of Tonelli's.

168
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:31,653
- Friends, perhaps, but nothing more.
- Miss Conley...

169
00:16:31,832 --> 00:16:35,825
...there's no danger of implicating
yourself by answers you might give.

170
00:16:36,003 --> 00:16:40,064
I'd just like it made clear if Pete's done
anything, he can do his own hanging.

171
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,004
- Well, that point is now on the record.
- That's good.

172
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:46,612
You took a trip one time with Pete,
didn't you?

173
00:16:47,714 --> 00:16:49,545
It was on a yacht.

174
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:52,708
And I believe you went
to the West Indies.

175
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:56,686
- Yacht?
- Yeah, those long, white things.

176
00:16:56,857 --> 00:16:59,018
I know what's a yacht.

177
00:16:59,192 --> 00:17:02,628
Some cops assume because you've
been persecuted falsely all over...

178
00:17:02,796 --> 00:17:04,058
Persecuted falsely?

179
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,394
I'm sure the lieutenant didn't mean
to offend you, Miss Conley.

180
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,160
Excuse me, please.

181
00:17:09,336 --> 00:17:13,830
- Watch how you're kicking my shins.
- Vince, give me a hand.

182
00:17:20,514 --> 00:17:22,675
I thought perhaps you could use
a drink.

183
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:25,750
Yeah, like some dumb cops
could use some manners.

184
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,114
That much over the flagstones,
Mr. Hallett.

185
00:17:28,522 --> 00:17:32,424
When are you gonna quit asking her
and start telling her for a change?

186
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,187
Would you like to step out
while I'm doing this?

187
00:17:35,362 --> 00:17:37,353
You gonna do it this way? Yeah.

188
00:17:37,531 --> 00:17:39,692
Thanks.

189
00:17:48,742 --> 00:17:50,437
There you are.

190
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,670
- You're not joining?
- No.

191
00:17:52,846 --> 00:17:55,781
I guess where you've been,
you can lap it up all you want.

192
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,713
Well, here's to the boys
in the friendly trenches.

193
00:17:58,885 --> 00:18:00,876
Skol.

194
00:18:04,157 --> 00:18:05,954
It's a wonderfully strong vintage.

195
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,794
I don't know what you're after
with me, Mr. Hallett...

196
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:14,229
...but I will say I like the way
you're going after it.

197
00:18:14,568 --> 00:18:17,298
But I think it's only fair to warn you...

198
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,701
...l've been approached
from every angle...

199
00:18:19,873 --> 00:18:24,003
...including this one of "let's get
her loaded and see what happens."

200
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:26,672
I don't doubt it.

201
00:18:27,581 --> 00:18:31,881
Due to some kind of chemicals
in my makeup, I guess...

202
00:18:32,052 --> 00:18:36,352
...they always run out of money before
they ever find out what happens.

203
00:18:36,523 --> 00:18:39,083
Well, thank you for telling me.

204
00:18:40,093 --> 00:18:45,360
Now, to get back to this yachting trip
that you took with Pete.

205
00:18:45,532 --> 00:18:48,592
Wasn't this boat owned
by Mr. Ben Costain?

206
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:50,930
- It was owned by somebody.
- Yes, of course.

207
00:18:51,104 --> 00:18:53,698
It was a big boat.
I can't imagine it being unowned.

208
00:18:53,874 --> 00:18:57,901
But Costain owned it, and you were
on it when it went to the West Indies.

209
00:18:58,245 --> 00:19:00,941
Since when is trips
on yachts illegal?

210
00:19:01,114 --> 00:19:03,810
I told you, we're not accusing you
of anything.

211
00:19:03,984 --> 00:19:05,451
It's Ben Costain we're after.

212
00:19:05,619 --> 00:19:08,713
How many guys have already gone
after that person...

213
00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:11,084
...and ended up 12 feet under?

214
00:19:11,258 --> 00:19:14,056
I think the government has
a way to finally get him...

215
00:19:14,227 --> 00:19:16,422
...if we can get some help from you.

216
00:19:16,596 --> 00:19:17,858
Me?

217
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:23,333
He didn't notice if I had three heads
or four that whole delightful cruise.

218
00:19:23,503 --> 00:19:27,234
Now, on this trip
to the West Indies...

219
00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:30,342
...the boat put in
to several islands, didn't it?

220
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:33,001
- Did it?
- You know it did. Why?

221
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,910
I don't know. I took it Mr. Costain
was interested...

222
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,846
...in some untamed natives perhaps.

223
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:43,081
And at one of these islands,
this man came aboard the yacht.

224
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:45,451
Signor Maracelli.

225
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:49,652
The Italian garden expert. He taught
me to say his name himself.

226
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,390
Did you notice how long
he stayed aboard?

227
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:56,434
Sure. Until we let him off one night,
near Florida someplace.

228
00:19:56,603 --> 00:19:58,093
For what reason?

229
00:19:58,271 --> 00:20:01,536
Oh, he was looking
for some night-blooming wildlife.

230
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:03,869
Did he come back to the yacht?

231
00:20:04,044 --> 00:20:09,380
They told us the signor
was destroyed in the swamp.

232
00:20:10,217 --> 00:20:12,651
These are people that you
don't doubt their word.

233
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:14,810
When they say somebody's
in the swamp...

234
00:20:14,988 --> 00:20:16,580
...you don't ask for wet shoes.

235
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,054
Yes.

236
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:23,390
Well, Signor Maracelli's real name
happens to be Frank Domano...

237
00:20:23,563 --> 00:20:26,964
...one of the bosses of the Mafia.
- I thought he'd get someplace.

238
00:20:27,134 --> 00:20:30,729
He's been involved in quite a few
murders since he was destroyed.

239
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:34,168
And by smuggling a man
of this kind into the country...

240
00:20:34,341 --> 00:20:37,401
...Costain perjured his application
for citizenship.

241
00:20:37,577 --> 00:20:41,274
I mean that when Costain swore he
was a man of good moral character...

242
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,710
...he lied.

243
00:20:42,883 --> 00:20:46,751
And the testimony of either you
or Pete could prove that he lied.

244
00:20:48,088 --> 00:20:52,752
Well, unless Pete has changed
an awful lot from the good old days...

245
00:20:52,926 --> 00:20:57,090
...I don't get a very clear picture
of him busting his back...

246
00:20:57,264 --> 00:20:59,858
...to call a man like Mr. Costain
a liar.

247
00:21:00,033 --> 00:21:02,024
How about you?

248
00:21:02,202 --> 00:21:04,693
When I think of it in connection
with myself...

249
00:21:04,871 --> 00:21:08,534
...I just don't get no picture at all,
clear or otherwise.

250
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,573
Why not? Afraid?

251
00:21:10,744 --> 00:21:13,872
Coward would describe it better,
Mr. Hallett.

252
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:16,208
Don't you think
we could protect you?

253
00:21:16,383 --> 00:21:18,613
I wouldn't wanna put you
to the test...

254
00:21:18,785 --> 00:21:22,050
...knowing how embarrassed
you'd be if you flunked.

255
00:21:22,722 --> 00:21:26,214
And why did you drag me up here
when Pete could tell you?

256
00:21:26,393 --> 00:21:28,293
Or has he already been approached...

257
00:21:28,461 --> 00:21:32,397
...and did he spot the drawbacks
as fast as I did?

258
00:21:32,566 --> 00:21:34,534
Pete's dead.

259
00:21:36,903 --> 00:21:39,463
I'm assuming it wasn't old age.

260
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:42,574
He was murdered
by the Costain mob.

261
00:21:42,742 --> 00:21:46,178
I wouldn't wanna say I told you so,
but that's a point I'd make.

262
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:49,144
It was a ruthless, vicious,
unnecessary killing...

263
00:21:49,316 --> 00:21:53,082
...like all the others Costain has been
responsible for the last 25 years.

264
00:21:53,253 --> 00:21:55,312
He's been at it long enough
to get good.

265
00:21:55,488 --> 00:21:59,322
You don't seem to understand.
We're trying to deport Costain.

266
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:02,984
It should be everyone's responsibility
to see that we're successful.

267
00:22:03,163 --> 00:22:05,688
- That's the way you feel.
- Yes, I do.

268
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,857
If anyone has any help
to give us...

269
00:22:08,034 --> 00:22:10,025
...it's his obligation to give it.

270
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:13,434
If anybody got anything
but a kick in the face from society...

271
00:22:13,607 --> 00:22:16,201
...I don't doubt he might owe
something back to it.

272
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,936
You realize you're the only one
who can help us.

273
00:22:19,112 --> 00:22:22,309
I'm afraid I've been wasting
your time, Mr. Hallett.

274
00:22:22,482 --> 00:22:23,744
Wasting?

275
00:22:23,917 --> 00:22:25,976
The more I think,
the more I realize...

276
00:22:26,152 --> 00:22:29,679
...it was the North Indies
we went to on our trip.

277
00:22:29,856 --> 00:22:31,118
It was the West Indies.

278
00:22:31,291 --> 00:22:35,591
"Good evening. Have you called for
one of our tastefully gay dinners?" No.

279
00:22:35,762 --> 00:22:40,392
Hello? I'd like to speak to somebody
about your lobster thermidors.

280
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,966
For eating, yes.

281
00:22:42,135 --> 00:22:44,501
- You can order anything.
- That's nice to hear.

282
00:22:44,671 --> 00:22:47,902
Only after we've finished
our talk about Costain.

283
00:22:48,074 --> 00:22:50,304
You mean the subject's
not exhausted?

284
00:22:50,477 --> 00:22:52,468
I wish you wouldn't make up
your mind...

285
00:22:52,646 --> 00:22:54,637
...until you carefully thought it over.

286
00:22:54,814 --> 00:22:57,248
My mind was making up
while I was hearing...

287
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,977
...that Pete was no longer with us.

288
00:23:00,153 --> 00:23:02,678
I'm not denying that it is dangerous.

289
00:23:02,856 --> 00:23:05,848
But I can assure you nothing
is going to be left undone...

290
00:23:06,026 --> 00:23:08,085
...to give you
every possible protection.

291
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:10,855
Yeah, but how can I even think
about it...

292
00:23:11,031 --> 00:23:13,522
...when I'm famished
all over the place?

293
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,227
Perhaps you're not acquainted with
what my rights as a prisoner are...

294
00:23:17,404 --> 00:23:19,531
...under several
already-legislated laws.

295
00:23:19,706 --> 00:23:22,539
Section 3, article 12:
Feeding of prisoners.

296
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:26,770
Prisoners will be fed at three regulated
intervals during the daylight hours.

297
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:30,940
At 6 in the mornings, at 12:00 noons
and at 5 p.m.

298
00:23:31,117 --> 00:23:34,211
Today, these intervals have been
anything but regulated.

299
00:23:34,387 --> 00:23:38,346
Do you want to check my authenticity
in the book of regulations, Mr. Hallett?

300
00:23:38,525 --> 00:23:41,858
Miss Conley, I bow
to your authenticity.

301
00:23:42,028 --> 00:23:44,223
After this we'll try
and stick to the rules.

302
00:23:44,397 --> 00:23:46,388
Yeah, you do that.

303
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:52,469
It's me again, about
those lobster thermidors.

304
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:56,097
- Would you like me to order for you?
- I'd like the fun of doing it.

305
00:23:56,276 --> 00:23:59,439
All right. But before I leave,
I'd like to assure you...

306
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:02,672
...no one is going to make you
do anything against your will.

307
00:24:02,849 --> 00:24:05,784
I'm afraid there isn't much
of a chance of that happening.

308
00:24:06,252 --> 00:24:07,514
I'll be back later.

309
00:24:07,687 --> 00:24:10,850
Good. No, I don't wanna talk
to the manager.

310
00:24:11,024 --> 00:24:14,755
I wanna talk to the man that cooks
those tastefully gay dinners.

311
00:24:14,928 --> 00:24:18,659
You may as well stuff yourself too.
Tonight it's on the taxpayers.

312
00:24:23,937 --> 00:24:25,768
How'd it go?

313
00:24:25,939 --> 00:24:28,271
I didn't expect much on the first try.

314
00:24:28,441 --> 00:24:31,274
She didn't jump at the chance, huh?

315
00:24:31,711 --> 00:24:34,009
Well, what's the plan now?

316
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:37,377
I'll talk to the governor about
making a deal on her sentence...

317
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,950
...and get a couple of other things
going.

318
00:24:40,387 --> 00:24:43,447
How long can we keep it
from Costain if we've got her here?

319
00:24:43,623 --> 00:24:48,219
I'm sorry to say, he's got connections
in prison like anywhere else.

320
00:24:48,395 --> 00:24:51,853
He knows we picked her up and
haven't arrived at the jail with her...

321
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,466
...so he'll figure
we've got her stashed.

322
00:24:54,634 --> 00:24:57,125
Well, in the meantime,
please be nice to her.

323
00:24:57,303 --> 00:25:00,466
It won't hurt our cause a bit
if you treat her like a lady.

324
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,007
- Will she know what we're doing?
- There wouldn't be a lady left...

325
00:25:04,177 --> 00:25:07,806
...if every time one of them acted
ladylike, she got kicked in the face.

326
00:25:08,415 --> 00:25:10,007
Now, take good care of her.

327
00:25:10,183 --> 00:25:12,242
She's no good to us
if she won't testify.

328
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:14,182
Yeah, if she's too dead.

329
00:25:14,354 --> 00:25:16,185
Yeah.

330
00:25:34,107 --> 00:25:36,871
- Where's Conley?
- She wanted to take a shower.

331
00:25:37,043 --> 00:25:39,739
- Shower?
- I didn't see any harm in it!

332
00:25:43,883 --> 00:25:46,943
So this is what the police
has sunk to.

333
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,612
The next time she takes a shower,
you sit on her lap. I mean it.

334
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:53,122
You ever lay a fat hand
on my person again...

335
00:25:53,293 --> 00:25:56,888
...and the prison board will hear
about it before I'm even dry!

336
00:26:25,592 --> 00:26:25,658
<i>I won't lose him again.</i>

337
00:26:25,658 --> 00:26:27,683
<i>I won't lose him again.</i>

338
00:26:28,595 --> 00:26:30,460
Dumb slob.

339
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:33,895
Losing that DA. I don't know where
he's been the last two hours.

340
00:26:34,067 --> 00:26:38,026
We'll find out where they've taken her.
There's no need to get so upset.

341
00:26:39,439 --> 00:26:42,567
We'll find out, eh?

342
00:26:42,742 --> 00:26:46,109
For 200-grand-a-year attorney's fees,
you couldn't even find out...

343
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:48,440
...they were gonna spring
Tonelli on us.

344
00:26:48,615 --> 00:26:52,210
I don't have all your sources
of information, Ben.

345
00:26:52,385 --> 00:26:54,046
Yeah.

346
00:26:56,389 --> 00:26:58,721
- Well?
- <i>Nothing yet.</i>

347
00:26:58,892 --> 00:27:02,384
The money I spend to get people
in all the places where it counts...

348
00:27:02,562 --> 00:27:06,396
...they can't even find out where
they're hiding one lousy dame.

349
00:27:06,566 --> 00:27:09,535
They leave prison to take her
to city jail three hours ago.

350
00:27:09,702 --> 00:27:11,829
They haven't got there yet.

351
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:16,831
Tonelli, they thought they had
hidden out at Staten Island.

352
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,103
Where do they think this one
will be safe?

353
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,975
I wouldn't worry too much about it,
in any case, Ben.

354
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,181
Wouldn't you?

355
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,754
They're not trying to run you out
of your own country...

356
00:27:29,923 --> 00:27:33,188
...and send you to some lousy place
you don't even remember.

357
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:36,522
She isn't going to hurt us, Ben.

358
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,858
No, she isn't.

359
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:43,230
Just let me find out
where they're keeping her...

360
00:27:44,604 --> 00:27:48,040
<i>She's in Room 2409,</i>
<i>St. Charles Hotel.</i>

361
00:27:49,442 --> 00:27:53,538
Girl's in Room 2409
at the St. Charles Hotel.

362
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:57,205
Room 2409, St. Charles Hotel.

363
00:28:06,292 --> 00:28:10,558
<i>Have you ever stopped to consider</i>
<i>what you'd look like completely bald?</i>

364
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,322
- What?
- <i>My sponsor's product...</i>

365
00:28:12,498 --> 00:28:15,194
<i>... means exactly what it says.</i>

366
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:22,402
<i>Yes, folks, this is your old hillbilly</i>
<i>cousin, Mississippi Mac.</i>

367
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:26,067
<i>If up until now you haven't had</i>
<i>any hillbilly cousins in your home...</i>

368
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,942
<i>... open up your hearts,</i>
<i>and I'm gonna creep right in.</i>

369
00:28:29,115 --> 00:28:30,446
Oh, brother.

370
00:28:30,617 --> 00:28:33,586
<i>We've only been on the air</i>
<i>six hours and 47 minutes...</i>

371
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,517
<i>... but we'll be on until Monday</i>
<i>and longer than that...</i>

372
00:28:36,689 --> 00:28:39,089
<i>... if it takes it to raise that $50,000.</i>

373
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,251
Leave it on!

374
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:46,624
<i>If you folks out there have been</i>
<i>saying to yourself:</i>

375
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,768
<i>"What will I do with that $ 100</i>
<i>that's been laying around...</i>

376
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,234
<i>... and collecting dust</i>
<i>and curious glances?"</i>

377
00:28:52,405 --> 00:28:54,430
<i>Send it in to old Mississippi Mac...</i>

378
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,438
<i>... and some boy will get a chance...</i>

379
00:28:56,609 --> 00:29:00,272
<i>... to lead a normal, bronco-busting,</i>
<i>rope-twirling life. Yes, sir.</i>

380
00:29:00,446 --> 00:29:03,472
<i>While you're sending in</i>
<i>your donations, I'll sing for you.</i>

381
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,662
He is pretty awful.

382
00:29:25,838 --> 00:29:28,329
Perhaps we better just turn him off
for now...

383
00:29:28,508 --> 00:29:30,840
...because he's gonna be on all night
anyway.

384
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:38,578
Never mind, peeping John.

385
00:29:38,751 --> 00:29:43,415
I made sure there was nothing
left over for you to enjoy.

386
00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:47,184
Bad as it is in prison to have to share
your shower with the inmates...

387
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,591
...at least we don't have
to be slapped by the police.

388
00:29:50,763 --> 00:29:53,527
You've hauled men in for less.

389
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,691
Willoughby, you got a needle
and thread?

390
00:29:55,868 --> 00:29:59,668
- What do you want it for?
- This is strangling my circulation off.

391
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,704
Maybe there's a seam
we can open up...

392
00:30:01,874 --> 00:30:05,037
...so I won't be so scrunched
and pinched in places.

393
00:30:05,211 --> 00:30:08,112
- I could go down to the drugstore.
- You can call.

394
00:30:08,281 --> 00:30:11,375
- I'd like a little coffee too.
- They'll send that up too.

395
00:30:11,551 --> 00:30:13,849
Afraid I won't come back,
lieutenant?

396
00:30:14,954 --> 00:30:17,218
All right, go ahead.

397
00:30:17,623 --> 00:30:20,649
Besides, when a person's places
are scrunched and pinched...

398
00:30:20,827 --> 00:30:22,818
...something's liable
to bust right out.

399
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:26,556
That'd drive all the peeping Johns
in the place stark staring crazy.

400
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:30,396
- Will you shut up about my...
- I won't be long, lieutenant.

401
00:30:31,471 --> 00:30:34,406
- Oh, my pocketbook.
- Charge it to the room.

402
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:08,700
Is that the way a genuine model
does it?

403
00:31:10,376 --> 00:31:11,775
Again, please?

404
00:31:12,044 --> 00:31:15,036
You used to be a model, didn't you?

405
00:31:15,948 --> 00:31:17,609
How could you tell?

406
00:31:17,784 --> 00:31:20,048
It's on your police record.

407
00:31:21,621 --> 00:31:24,556
You models must lead a gay life
for yourselves, huh?

408
00:31:24,724 --> 00:31:28,558
Never have to worry about who's
gonna pick up the dinner tab.

409
00:31:29,061 --> 00:31:30,323
It's not a gay life?

410
00:31:30,496 --> 00:31:34,557
What's gay about blistered feet and
a bunch of sleazy married guys...

411
00:31:34,734 --> 00:31:38,636
...with ideas that were stale
when the Romans was eating lions?

412
00:31:38,805 --> 00:31:40,739
How long were you at it?

413
00:31:40,907 --> 00:31:42,636
Modeling?

414
00:31:43,242 --> 00:31:44,800
Since I was 16.

415
00:31:44,977 --> 00:31:46,740
Sixteen?

416
00:31:46,913 --> 00:31:50,076
Well, what should I have done,
sold pencils maybe?

417
00:31:50,249 --> 00:31:54,652
Or gone on relief, for which there
isn't any for 16-year-old girls?

418
00:31:54,821 --> 00:31:57,813
- What did you do, lie about your age?
- Who to?

419
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:00,481
They're more interested
you're a real build kid...

420
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,254
...not how old a real build kid.
- Yeah.

421
00:32:03,429 --> 00:32:05,761
Who got you the job?

422
00:32:07,934 --> 00:32:12,268
I was waiting for a bus
one windy day...

423
00:32:12,438 --> 00:32:15,032
...when all the skirts was blowing.

424
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:19,042
This fella drives up in a convertible
and struck up an introduction.

425
00:32:19,212 --> 00:32:24,343
He was a real cornball. And he
sort of looked me over, and he said:

426
00:32:24,517 --> 00:32:28,647
"Well, now, are there any more
at home like you, little lady?"

427
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:31,119
I told him the only thing
there was more of...

428
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:34,851
...was a brother 6-foot-4, who liked
to knock out teeth for exercise.

429
00:32:35,027 --> 00:32:40,158
Why, I just made this brother up
out of my head for protection.

430
00:32:42,068 --> 00:32:45,469
So then what happened?

431
00:32:45,638 --> 00:32:49,734
And, well, he went on and said:

432
00:32:50,243 --> 00:32:53,110
"A little girl like you shouldn't
be waiting all alone...

433
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,747
...for buses in this big, cold world.

434
00:32:55,915 --> 00:32:59,316
I'll introduce you to a friend of mine
that makes bathing suits."

435
00:32:59,485 --> 00:33:03,046
So I told him I didn't know anything
about how to make bathing suits.

436
00:33:03,222 --> 00:33:06,521
And he said, "No, little lady,
you wouldn't make them.

437
00:33:06,692 --> 00:33:08,353
You'd wear them."

438
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:10,860
He explained that he didn't mean
at beaches...

439
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,659
...but at buyers' shows, where these
out-of-town fellas like himself...

440
00:33:14,834 --> 00:33:19,703
...would come to pick up
whatever looked good to them.

441
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:24,536
And whatever looks good to
these fellas is that old combination...

442
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:30,444
...of "most girl, least bathing suit,"
if you know what I mean.

443
00:33:30,616 --> 00:33:32,083
Yeah, I think I do.

444
00:33:32,251 --> 00:33:36,051
So I got the bathing-suit job.

445
00:33:37,423 --> 00:33:38,856
And then...

446
00:33:39,158 --> 00:33:44,221
...for a year there, we were sort of
making plans for getting married...

447
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:48,128
...until one gloomy day, this older
woman pops up from Omaha...

448
00:33:48,301 --> 00:33:51,361
...and she cries and wrings
her hands and pleads with me...

449
00:33:51,537 --> 00:33:54,836
...that I should leave him alone,
for his own good.

450
00:33:55,007 --> 00:33:58,534
I should leave him alone,
for his own good.

451
00:33:58,978 --> 00:34:00,639
Men.

452
00:34:01,047 --> 00:34:05,575
They ought to trade themselves in
for something a girl really needs.

453
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:09,988
Well, you've got it all figured out
about men, haven't you?

454
00:34:10,156 --> 00:34:11,350
You're all alike.

455
00:34:11,524 --> 00:34:15,688
You only got different faces
so we girls can tell you apart.

456
00:34:16,062 --> 00:34:19,293
- Take yourself, for instance.
- What about me?

457
00:34:19,465 --> 00:34:21,763
I walk out here with no skirt...

458
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:25,665
...and your eyes bang out like you just
found some long lost gold mine.

459
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:28,773
Oh, sure. Everybody's after you,
every minute.

460
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:32,272
- It might seem so, if you were me.
- Well, you can relax, honey.

461
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,738
Thanks, I intend to.

462
00:34:33,913 --> 00:34:37,280
I could come back from 10 years
alone on the moon, half-crazy...

463
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:41,045
...and watch you swimming, stripped,
at the Y for hours and walk out...

464
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:45,384
...with no thoughts in my head except
where I could get myself a good meal.

465
00:34:52,098 --> 00:34:55,727
Now, that was
a crummy thing to say.

466
00:34:56,936 --> 00:34:58,631
It wasn't as bad as all that.

467
00:34:59,171 --> 00:35:03,540
Since I was the one that was insulted,
I'll be the judge of how bad it was.

468
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,772
Okay, I'm sorry.

469
00:35:05,945 --> 00:35:09,642
If you didn't know where I was from,
you wouldn't talk to me like that.

470
00:35:12,418 --> 00:35:16,445
Now, look, I said I was sorry.
And I mean it.

471
00:35:16,622 --> 00:35:17,646
I'm sorry.

472
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,794
Well, it doesn't matter
much anyway...

473
00:35:23,963 --> 00:35:28,957
...since none of us swim stripped at
the Y, even when people are watching.

474
00:35:29,935 --> 00:35:35,339
And how could you know that all you'd
be thinking about was a good meal?

475
00:35:35,875 --> 00:35:39,743
You might not be as interested
in food as you think you'd be.

476
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,274
Vince? Vince?

477
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:48,578
- Trouble on the roof.
- Lee, get in there and stay with her!

478
00:35:49,822 --> 00:35:51,722
Hurry up, Willoughby!

479
00:35:54,293 --> 00:35:57,091
- What did I do?
- We found him hiding in the elevator.

480
00:35:57,263 --> 00:35:58,628
I work there.
That's my job.

481
00:35:58,798 --> 00:36:01,289
Maybe that's true, maybe not.
He was acting funny.

482
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:03,731
See how you act if about
20 guys jump on you.

483
00:36:03,903 --> 00:36:08,101
Take him and check with the manager.
If you make a mistake, apologize.

484
00:36:08,274 --> 00:36:11,334
Packer, check the elevator shafts.
Seal them off at the roof.

485
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,705
- You mean, climb inside them?
- You heard me.

486
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:15,141
- You heard him.
- Yes, sir.

487
00:36:15,314 --> 00:36:17,748
- Glad you're a lieutenant these days?
- Any day.

488
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,049
Lee?

489
00:36:35,167 --> 00:36:36,498
What was the matter?

490
00:36:36,669 --> 00:36:39,763
Oh, just an elevator man.
He kind of got off course.

491
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:49,274
I was just thinking, why should I have
them steamed clams for dinner?

492
00:36:50,483 --> 00:36:54,112
You've gone from lobster thermidor
to pheasant to steamed clams.

493
00:36:54,286 --> 00:36:56,186
- Now you wanna change again?
- So?

494
00:36:56,355 --> 00:36:59,017
Any reason, except trying
to bankrupt the government?

495
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:01,887
When does a woman need a
reason for changing her mind?

496
00:37:02,061 --> 00:37:05,929
- Mr. Hallett said I could have anything.
- He didn't know what he was saying.

497
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:08,760
With all this changing,
how do you expect to get fed?

498
00:37:09,168 --> 00:37:12,160
Well, it's just that I want it right
when I do eat.

499
00:37:12,338 --> 00:37:14,272
They're gonna love you in the kitchen.

500
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,670
Anyway, I'm canceling the clams out.

501
00:37:17,243 --> 00:37:18,710
Fine.

502
00:37:20,913 --> 00:37:25,316
When I think how it was with you cops
the last time I was framed...

503
00:37:25,484 --> 00:37:28,715
I was hauled in all over, and when
I asked for some water...

504
00:37:28,888 --> 00:37:32,449
...or legal advice, what did you say?
"Drop 10,000 feet dead."

505
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,923
Look, I never saw you before tonight.

506
00:37:35,094 --> 00:37:36,891
Unfortunately, a cop is a cop.

507
00:37:37,062 --> 00:37:40,691
You were sent up on accessory
to a crime and harboring a criminal.

508
00:37:40,866 --> 00:37:44,029
And being a cop, you couldn't
imagine it might be a phony rap?

509
00:37:44,203 --> 00:37:47,138
I never met one of you girls
who wasn't up on a phony rap.

510
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:52,141
Why should a cop strain his brain to
give anybody the benefit of his doubt?

511
00:37:52,711 --> 00:37:55,373
All right.
What was this crime?

512
00:37:55,548 --> 00:37:57,482
The one you weren't
an accessory to?

513
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:03,414
Well, this payroll, where I was working
as a model, was stuck up.

514
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:06,820
All by itself?
Or did your boyfriend help?

515
00:38:07,026 --> 00:38:10,655
So what? How was I to know he was
gonna do a stupid thing like that?

516
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:14,095
- Didn't he do anything stupid before?
- All right, he might have.

517
00:38:14,266 --> 00:38:16,962
Was he gonna have his record
tattooed on his forehead?

518
00:38:17,136 --> 00:38:20,105
- Why didn't you ask for credentials?
- Now he tells me.

519
00:38:20,873 --> 00:38:23,842
Let's see if I can give you
the rest of the facts, ma'am.

520
00:38:24,009 --> 00:38:28,309
This guy romances you and finds out
all about the payroll setup.

521
00:38:28,981 --> 00:38:32,542
When he finally pulls the job,
he bungles it and a guard gets shot...

522
00:38:32,718 --> 00:38:36,745
...and the boyfriend himself probably
takes a bullet in a not-too-vital spot.

523
00:38:36,922 --> 00:38:39,652
How does he do it
with nothing to go on?

524
00:38:39,825 --> 00:38:43,386
- Except files that tell the whole story.
- I didn't need police files.

525
00:38:43,562 --> 00:38:46,861
That story was old and stale when
they were sticking up pyramids.

526
00:38:47,967 --> 00:38:51,027
So after he gets shot,
he comes running to you...

527
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:53,194
...and you hide him
in your apartment...

528
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:57,433
...the last place in the world the cops
would ever think of looking for him.

529
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:00,477
How does he figure it out
with nothing to go on?

530
00:39:00,646 --> 00:39:03,137
Except a charge that reads
"harboring a criminal."

531
00:39:03,315 --> 00:39:06,079
You did hide him.
So, what's so phony about the rap?

532
00:39:06,252 --> 00:39:08,743
How was I to know he was gonna
stick up the joint?

533
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:12,857
- Then you were a chump to hide him.
- A chump, I was.

534
00:39:13,025 --> 00:39:15,858
But that isn't what I was charged with.

535
00:39:17,463 --> 00:39:19,693
You don't believe me, do you?

536
00:39:19,965 --> 00:39:21,933
Well, a jury didn't, that's obvious.

537
00:39:22,768 --> 00:39:24,633
What jury?

538
00:39:24,803 --> 00:39:27,704
This $ 75 lawyer I hired told me
to plead guilty...

539
00:39:27,873 --> 00:39:30,433
...and throw myself on
the mercy of this judge.

540
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:33,737
The only mercy was he didn't
hang me on the spot.

541
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:37,314
After serving four years
of this guy's mercy...

542
00:39:37,483 --> 00:39:40,816
...next time, I'm gonna put some
poison in the hollow of my tooth.

543
00:39:40,986 --> 00:39:45,514
The whole point of this is, I've decided
I don't want any steamed clams.

544
00:39:46,892 --> 00:39:48,587
Okay.

545
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,657
What have you decided
you want now?

546
00:39:54,133 --> 00:40:00,038
Well, I was sort of thinking maybe
I'd have something under glass.

547
00:40:01,206 --> 00:40:03,401
Like cracked crab or...

548
00:40:03,909 --> 00:40:05,604
...crepes of chicken.

549
00:40:06,645 --> 00:40:08,636
Well, there's such a thing.

550
00:40:08,814 --> 00:40:11,214
You want to order some of it for me?

551
00:40:11,383 --> 00:40:12,907
Please?

552
00:40:13,652 --> 00:40:15,984
I'd be two days getting up the nerve.

553
00:40:17,423 --> 00:40:19,584
You better do it yourself.

554
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:27,560
If somebody should locate him,
have him call me.

555
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,101
My office here will know
where to reach me all night.

556
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:32,635
Yeah.

557
00:40:32,871 --> 00:40:33,895
Thanks.

558
00:40:34,073 --> 00:40:38,009
All I've dug up is she's got a father
and a married sister in the city.

559
00:40:38,177 --> 00:40:42,307
Those are probably old addresses,
but we'll get on them in the morning.

560
00:40:42,715 --> 00:40:44,080
Tonight.

561
00:40:44,249 --> 00:40:45,841
- Tonight?
- Tonight.

562
00:40:46,018 --> 00:40:50,216
Do you realize that that trial reopens
in exactly 37 hours?

563
00:40:50,389 --> 00:40:54,086
Without Conley as a witness,
we'll be sent back to law school.

564
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:56,518
Okay. Any news from the governor?

565
00:40:56,695 --> 00:41:00,062
No, he's off someplace opening
an apple festival or something.

566
00:41:00,232 --> 00:41:02,393
He'll get back to me
tonight sometime.

567
00:41:02,568 --> 00:41:06,629
If he agrees to commute the rest of her
sentence, do you think she'll testify?

568
00:41:06,805 --> 00:41:09,968
All we can do is try it on her for size.

569
00:41:10,976 --> 00:41:13,968
- Yes?
- <i>Mr. Rickles to see you.</i>

570
00:41:14,146 --> 00:41:16,171
- Who?
- <i>Rickles, Marvin Rickles.</i>

571
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:19,442
<i>He says he's the attorney</i>
<i>for Mr. Costain.</i>

572
00:41:20,085 --> 00:41:22,815
- Send him in.
- I'll go.

573
00:41:22,988 --> 00:41:26,856
He probably doesn't like witnesses
when he bribes government officials.

574
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,119
Don't you want to hear
what he has to say?

575
00:41:29,294 --> 00:41:31,819
I get sick so easily.

576
00:41:39,104 --> 00:41:42,267
I apologize for disturbing you
at this late hour, Mr. Hallett.

577
00:41:42,441 --> 00:41:45,467
What difference does time make
if you have something to say?

578
00:41:45,644 --> 00:41:48,204
- Sit down.
- I'll only keep you a moment.

579
00:41:48,947 --> 00:41:53,907
We've heard rumors, about another
secret witness, that have disturbed us.

580
00:41:54,086 --> 00:41:55,747
I don't know what you heard.

581
00:41:55,921 --> 00:41:59,186
You have a secret witness you're
going to spring in court Monday.

582
00:42:00,225 --> 00:42:04,685
My experience a few days ago taught
me that I can't surprise you people.

583
00:42:04,863 --> 00:42:08,663
- I don't know what you mean.
- I mean you were ready for Tonelli.

584
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:12,962
Are you accusing Costain of having
anything to do with Tonelli's death?

585
00:42:13,138 --> 00:42:14,571
Oh, knock it off, Rickles.

586
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:19,070
This office isn't wired for anything,
so don't play persecuted client.

587
00:42:19,244 --> 00:42:22,441
Tonelli was a cheap hoodlum
with hundreds of enemies.

588
00:42:22,614 --> 00:42:24,275
Anyone could have killed him.

589
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:27,146
Yes, and the stork could have
brought him first.

590
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:28,877
I don't believe that anymore...

591
00:42:29,054 --> 00:42:31,784
...because I know, even with
police as good as ours...

592
00:42:31,957 --> 00:42:34,551
...you can always dig up
one or two who'll sell out.

593
00:42:34,726 --> 00:42:36,591
And you did dig them up, didn't you?

594
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:40,493
- They tipped you off about Tonelli.
- You'll have to back up those charges.

595
00:42:40,899 --> 00:42:42,730
Oh, that's all.

596
00:42:42,901 --> 00:42:44,528
In a hearing of this kind...

597
00:42:44,703 --> 00:42:48,070
...the defense has a right to question
all witnesses beforehand.

598
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,174
I didn't say I had a witness, you did.

599
00:42:50,476 --> 00:42:55,175
And don't think I'm going to sit still for
any of your unethical trial practices.

600
00:42:56,148 --> 00:42:59,640
I've been conditioned to stomach
almost anything.

601
00:42:59,818 --> 00:43:02,343
But not hearing someone like
you talk about ethics.

602
00:43:02,521 --> 00:43:03,818
I'm not gonna take this...

603
00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:06,389
Ethics! Don't you choke
when you say that word?

604
00:43:06,558 --> 00:43:10,153
- We have certain legal rights...
- You don't have any rights to anything!

605
00:43:10,696 --> 00:43:13,096
Except to be stamped out
like any other disease.

606
00:43:13,265 --> 00:43:16,496
- We'll see when I get you in court.
- We'll see. Get out of here.

607
00:43:16,668 --> 00:43:18,568
If it's the last thing I ever do...

608
00:43:18,737 --> 00:43:22,434
It's gonna be the last thing you ever
did if you don't get out of here!

609
00:43:29,214 --> 00:43:31,273
Can I bust in for a minute?

610
00:43:35,287 --> 00:43:37,050
Thirty seconds.

611
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:43,659
I thought reporters were supposed to
be drunk this time on Saturday night.

612
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:47,265
Just the ones with money.
What was Rickles doing here?

613
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:51,558
- Trying to buy you off?
- He thinks I'm unethical.

614
00:43:51,737 --> 00:43:54,638
You know something? I am.

615
00:43:54,806 --> 00:43:58,537
Whenever I deal with something dirty,
I always get a little soiled myself.

616
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:01,042
I think the whole thing's
a joke anyway.

617
00:44:01,213 --> 00:44:05,809
Costain's a public menace who's been
murdering and looting for 25 years.

618
00:44:05,984 --> 00:44:09,181
What's he finally brought to trial on?
Denaturalization charges.

619
00:44:09,354 --> 00:44:12,084
Well, it's a start.
Now, look, Jim...

620
00:44:12,257 --> 00:44:15,624
...if I can get one witness on
that stand to testify against him...

621
00:44:15,794 --> 00:44:19,195
...then all of the others who know
anything against Costain...

622
00:44:19,364 --> 00:44:21,093
...will suddenly get courage.

623
00:44:21,266 --> 00:44:24,326
Then we'll start hitting him
with something that counts.

624
00:44:24,503 --> 00:44:27,438
But first, I need that one witness.

625
00:44:27,606 --> 00:44:29,471
Have you got one?

626
00:44:29,908 --> 00:44:31,170
Your 30 seconds are up.

627
00:44:31,343 --> 00:44:34,312
You might as well not show up
in court, Lloyd...

628
00:44:34,479 --> 00:44:38,040
...if you don't have
something spectacular.

629
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:39,917
Well?

630
00:44:40,118 --> 00:44:42,245
Will you be in court Monday?

631
00:44:42,654 --> 00:44:45,248
I'll be the one with the briefcase.

632
00:45:18,557 --> 00:45:21,788
You can only hope he taps
a hole through his head.

633
00:45:22,995 --> 00:45:26,522
Aren't you afraid that stuff's gonna
spoil you for real police work?

634
00:45:26,698 --> 00:45:28,791
The real thing is for 6-year-olds.

635
00:45:28,967 --> 00:45:31,492
And the girls in these,
don't they ever get cold?

636
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:33,831
- Not those girls.
- Want to borrow it?

637
00:45:34,006 --> 00:45:36,031
Anything sexier than
<i>Popular Mechanics...</i>

638
00:45:36,208 --> 00:45:38,403
...I break out in a rash, all over.

639
00:45:38,577 --> 00:45:40,135
You enjoy your dinner?

640
00:45:40,312 --> 00:45:42,405
I finished it.
You didn't think I would?

641
00:45:42,581 --> 00:45:44,606
I didn't think anybody could.

642
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,444
What do you say we drink a toast?

643
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,142
Oh, come on, lieutenant.

644
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:51,915
You have no idea how long it's been
since I had a toast with any man...

645
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,921
...much less something like you.

646
00:45:54,092 --> 00:45:58,620
No kidding. You have no idea how
utterly desirable you are to a girl.

647
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,699
What's the toast?

648
00:46:02,868 --> 00:46:05,769
Here's to the men
that blow up prisons.

649
00:46:08,106 --> 00:46:11,041
Don't worry, I won't snitch on you
that you drank on duty.

650
00:46:11,209 --> 00:46:13,837
Just make sure you don't tell
what he drank to.

651
00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:19,976
I'll take it inside.

652
00:46:25,223 --> 00:46:28,283
You know, he's sort of nice.

653
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,052
Is he married?

654
00:46:30,228 --> 00:46:32,492
I never saw him before.

655
00:46:33,198 --> 00:46:35,496
What's there about him
that you like?

656
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:37,328
I don't know.

657
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:40,031
That he's here, I guess.

658
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:43,440
Have you decided what
you're going to do?

659
00:46:43,608 --> 00:46:46,042
- About the lieutenant?
- No.

660
00:46:46,211 --> 00:46:47,678
I mean about Mr. Hallett.

661
00:46:49,514 --> 00:46:53,143
Why? Has he tried to get
you to work on me too?

662
00:46:53,318 --> 00:46:55,513
You know better than that.

663
00:46:56,288 --> 00:46:58,119
I'm sorry.

664
00:46:59,157 --> 00:47:05,619
Hallett tells me I owe it to society to
testify at the trial, as my last living act.

665
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:09,592
What do you think I owe
to society, Willoughby?

666
00:47:09,768 --> 00:47:11,895
I wouldn't want to say.

667
00:47:12,938 --> 00:47:15,805
If I was your daughter,
what would you tell me to do?

668
00:47:15,974 --> 00:47:18,408
I never tell her what to do.

669
00:47:18,577 --> 00:47:21,273
But I have tried to teach her
to face her obligations.

670
00:47:21,446 --> 00:47:24,313
Well, who says
this is my obligation?

671
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:29,619
And who wants a hero with her insides
blasted out with a shotgun?

672
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:34,283
And how are you gonna be sure
your daughter doesn't end up like me?

673
00:47:34,459 --> 00:47:37,485
There isn't any way I can be sure.

674
00:47:38,563 --> 00:47:40,656
But I can make her feel wanted...

675
00:47:40,932 --> 00:47:44,834
...and see to it that she gets
all the love I have to give.

676
00:47:45,003 --> 00:47:49,372
Those are the things all of you girls
seem to need the most.

677
00:47:51,276 --> 00:47:53,176
That's a fact.

678
00:47:53,845 --> 00:47:57,337
All the love I ever got,
you could put in your right eye.

679
00:48:07,993 --> 00:48:10,052
Yeah, you're right.

680
00:48:11,496 --> 00:48:15,057
A little love never hurt anybody.

681
00:48:16,334 --> 00:48:17,665
Yeah.

682
00:48:19,304 --> 00:48:20,293
Anything else?

683
00:48:20,472 --> 00:48:22,770
Yeah, tell her about
the governor's offer.

684
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:25,842
Give her a chance to think it over
before I get there.

685
00:48:26,511 --> 00:48:28,638
I'm leaving right now.

686
00:48:33,985 --> 00:48:35,816
Why don't you try and get some rest.

687
00:48:35,987 --> 00:48:39,150
Hours are gonna get 80 minutes long
at 4:00 in the morning.

688
00:48:39,324 --> 00:48:40,985
You're right.

689
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:46,956
Wake me if you turn that thing on and
Mississippi Mac suddenly gets funny.

690
00:48:53,438 --> 00:48:54,700
I just talked to Hallett.

691
00:48:55,574 --> 00:48:58,771
- He's such a refined man.
- Yeah.

692
00:48:58,944 --> 00:49:02,573
He says he's gonna be able to
knock off the rest of your sentence...

693
00:49:02,747 --> 00:49:05,944
...if you string along with him
Monday morning.

694
00:49:06,117 --> 00:49:08,984
- The whole 11 months?
- Yep.

695
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:15,782
Have you any idea how long 11
months is in a place like that?

696
00:49:16,127 --> 00:49:19,324
Long. Very, very long.

697
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,557
Then that's quite an offer.

698
00:49:25,937 --> 00:49:27,734
Maybe.

699
00:49:33,245 --> 00:49:35,679
How come you haven't asked me
for a date tonight?

700
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:41,114
Oh, maybe I figured it was Saturday
night and you're all tied up.

701
00:49:44,456 --> 00:49:47,482
Or maybe you just don't like girls.

702
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:55,859
No, I never found anything
I liked better.

703
00:49:59,137 --> 00:50:03,574
For a couple of reasons, one of them
being how much it costs to feed you...

704
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:07,569
I just can't figure you
for Pete Tonelli's girl.

705
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:11,038
I told you, I wasn't.

706
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:14,708
But the boat trips all over the Western
Hemisphere, how about that?

707
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:18,151
My actions were as pure
as the driving snow.

708
00:50:18,323 --> 00:50:22,817
And what's more,
Pete was the brother of Mitzi Tonelli...

709
00:50:22,994 --> 00:50:27,226
...who was one of my closest friends
during a certain period of my life.

710
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:30,334
That's why you went yachting,
because Mitzi asked you to?

711
00:50:30,502 --> 00:50:33,062
No, because he asked me to.

712
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:36,105
That's what I mean. Why?
Did he have money then or what?

713
00:50:36,274 --> 00:50:38,333
He didn't have nothing then.

714
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:43,413
He was just a poor, ugly,
miserable, little beat-up guy.

715
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:45,516
But you saw something in him that...

716
00:50:45,684 --> 00:50:49,120
What was there to see? He had
nothing nobody could want. Nothing.

717
00:50:49,287 --> 00:50:53,314
That's why when Costain invited him
to bring a girlfriend, he was in a spot.

718
00:50:53,491 --> 00:50:55,891
- Who'd go with him?
- You.

719
00:50:56,061 --> 00:50:58,996
Sure. I felt sorry for him.

720
00:51:00,332 --> 00:51:06,703
He wanted to look good, so he thought
if he took along a kind of...

721
00:51:07,038 --> 00:51:10,132
...pretty girl...
- Yeah, a pretty girl?

722
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:13,907
Well, anyway, he thought I was pretty.

723
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:15,910
And he figured if he had a girl...

724
00:51:16,081 --> 00:51:19,812
...of this type along to hold hands
with him while this person watched...

725
00:51:19,985 --> 00:51:22,715
- Well, that makes sense.
- It didn't neither.

726
00:51:22,887 --> 00:51:25,856
They never looked our way once
during the whole voyage.

727
00:51:26,024 --> 00:51:27,616
But you were ready, weren't you?

728
00:51:27,926 --> 00:51:31,362
To hold hands, nothing more.
Only hands.

729
00:51:31,529 --> 00:51:32,791
I get the picture.

730
00:51:33,798 --> 00:51:37,564
I guess you think it was
kind of cheap of me, huh?

731
00:51:38,503 --> 00:51:40,095
No.

732
00:51:41,573 --> 00:51:44,667
That sounds to me like
the kind of a favor...

733
00:51:44,843 --> 00:51:47,903
...that only a real nice girl
would think of doing.

734
00:51:48,847 --> 00:51:50,542
You really think that?

735
00:51:51,316 --> 00:51:52,305
Yep.

736
00:51:53,118 --> 00:51:55,814
Well, it was nothing, really.

737
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:59,252
Anyway, Mitzi Tonelli was your
best friend at this period.

738
00:51:59,424 --> 00:52:02,154
She could strangle and never
get a tear from me now.

739
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:38,025
<i>Thank you very much there, boys.</i>

740
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:41,427
<i>Hey, folks, now we've got to do</i>
<i>a lot better than that...</i>

741
00:52:43,401 --> 00:52:46,461
Television should be so good
that when you close your eyes...

742
00:52:46,638 --> 00:52:48,663
...it sounds like a radio.

743
00:52:50,175 --> 00:52:52,700
I'd like some real soft music.

744
00:52:53,812 --> 00:52:56,781
Turn that... That thing on the left
till it points to R.

745
00:53:24,642 --> 00:53:27,668
- Why are you a cop?
- Why not?

746
00:53:27,846 --> 00:53:30,144
Aren't there other jobs that are better?

747
00:53:30,315 --> 00:53:31,680
Better for what?

748
00:53:32,817 --> 00:53:36,378
Some people like some things,
some others like other things.

749
00:53:36,554 --> 00:53:40,684
I got out of the Army,
it was the best job I could get. I like it.

750
00:53:40,859 --> 00:53:43,453
You like going around
arresting people all the time?

751
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:46,859
Well, there's always the parades.

752
00:53:51,136 --> 00:53:53,104
Come on, lieutenant.

753
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:57,230
I'll keep you on your toes,
where a good cop's supposed to be.

754
00:54:21,099 --> 00:54:24,193
I guess you're not supposed to be
dancing with your prisoners.

755
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:26,763
Are you?

756
00:54:28,072 --> 00:54:31,337
I'm just trying to remember if
the question ever came up before.

757
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:36,874
I guess the reason you're
holding back is...

758
00:54:37,048 --> 00:54:40,142
...your wife wouldn't like you to
dance with a girl on duty.

759
00:54:40,418 --> 00:54:42,386
Even off duty.

760
00:54:44,189 --> 00:54:45,656
If I had a wife.

761
00:54:47,258 --> 00:54:48,816
You don't?

762
00:54:49,194 --> 00:54:51,822
Last time I looked, I sure didn't.

763
00:55:19,424 --> 00:55:20,413
Vince!

764
00:55:23,895 --> 00:55:24,884
Vince!

765
00:55:41,746 --> 00:55:44,476
Vince! Vince!

766
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,817
Room below this one!

767
00:55:52,991 --> 00:55:55,482
- Get the house doctor.
- Right.

768
00:55:55,727 --> 00:55:57,718
Get some more men up here.

769
00:55:58,196 --> 00:56:00,664
- Oh, Vince.
- Operator? Get a doctor up here.

770
00:56:00,832 --> 00:56:03,164
- It hurts.
- Then get me police headquarters.

771
00:56:03,334 --> 00:56:04,733
Yeah.

772
00:56:08,473 --> 00:56:10,373
Let's get her in the bedroom.

773
00:56:20,818 --> 00:56:23,343
Now, hold it a minute.
Nobody's going in there.

774
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:24,911
What's happened?

775
00:56:25,089 --> 00:56:28,183
There's been a shooting
somewhere in the top stories, sir.

776
00:56:33,031 --> 00:56:35,090
- Who is he?
- No identification yet.

777
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:38,929
It wasn't the fall that killed him.
He was shot before he started down.

778
00:56:39,103 --> 00:56:41,799
All he needs now is a well-dug grave.

779
00:57:00,558 --> 00:57:02,890
You're hurting me!

780
00:57:03,061 --> 00:57:05,154
- How is she?
- She's got a crease through...

781
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:07,662
- I wanna talk to you!
- You'd better lie down.

782
00:57:07,832 --> 00:57:11,928
Enough of this lying down.
I wanna go to my nice, safe prison.

783
00:57:12,103 --> 00:57:14,230
You have to lie down
and let the shot work.

784
00:57:14,405 --> 00:57:17,067
There are too many shots already
working around here.

785
00:57:17,241 --> 00:57:19,334
You're better off here
than anyplace else.

786
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:22,877
- Lf you're not dying, you're doing fine.
- We're all doing our best.

787
00:57:23,047 --> 00:57:25,208
- Somebody isn't!
- I'll give orders that...

788
00:57:25,383 --> 00:57:28,614
- What's the matter with Willoughby?
- Doc!

789
00:57:31,222 --> 00:57:33,713
Ambulance! She should've
been taken care of first!

790
00:57:33,891 --> 00:57:37,759
She didn't say anything. I guess she
was waiting till you finished with her.

791
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,233
It wasn't too much of a trick
to get up there from that.

792
00:57:45,403 --> 00:57:48,099
- Fine, thanks.
- It was an awful thing to have happen.

793
00:57:49,173 --> 00:57:51,164
On your honeymoon.

794
00:57:53,911 --> 00:57:56,243
I thought it was the waiter
with the champagne.

795
00:57:56,414 --> 00:58:00,248
When I answered, they pushed past
me and one covered me with a gun.

796
00:58:00,418 --> 00:58:02,283
- How many of them?
- There were three.

797
00:58:02,453 --> 00:58:04,318
And they were just terrible to me.

798
00:58:04,489 --> 00:58:07,253
I'd have torn them to pieces
if it wasn't for that gun.

799
00:58:08,259 --> 00:58:11,092
Yeah, lucky for them
they thought to bring it along.

800
00:58:12,397 --> 00:58:16,891
They were wearing some overalls
and carrying those short planks.

801
00:58:19,604 --> 00:58:22,801
- Everything's under control.
- Come upstairs when you're through.

802
00:58:22,974 --> 00:58:24,032
Is that blood?

803
00:58:24,208 --> 00:58:27,473
I took two bullets through the chest.
Just routine.

804
00:58:27,645 --> 00:58:30,409
It was actually three bullets.
We haven't told him yet.

805
00:58:31,516 --> 00:58:33,507
All right, let's hurry up with this.

806
00:58:36,821 --> 00:58:38,755
There were four of them, not three.

807
00:58:38,923 --> 00:58:42,620
The fourth had a gun on the elevator
operator to keep the elevator ready.

808
00:58:42,794 --> 00:58:45,388
When the deal went sour,
they ran in the elevator...

809
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:48,191
...and dropped to the alley,
where they had a car.

810
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:50,959
I just clocked it.
They were out in 40 seconds.

811
00:58:51,135 --> 00:58:53,968
Nice to know how
they do these things.

812
00:58:54,272 --> 00:58:56,638
You still want to move her
to the city jail?

813
00:58:56,808 --> 00:58:58,241
Oh, you mean, now?

814
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:01,742
Now that Costain knows we got her
and Willoughby's shot to pieces?

815
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:04,711
Not before, when she should
have been there, is that it?

816
00:59:04,882 --> 00:59:09,046
I've got my side of the job on this,
to see she gets on that stand.

817
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:11,484
- Dead or alive?
- Alive, and that's your job.

818
00:59:11,656 --> 00:59:14,454
- That's what I'm trying to do!
- Do you want to take her?

819
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:16,923
Costain has probably got
this hotel covered...

820
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:20,064
...just waiting for us to pull
something stupid like that.

821
00:59:20,231 --> 00:59:22,461
Well, then I guess we better not.

822
00:59:22,633 --> 00:59:25,568
All this hasn't accomplished
very much, has it?

823
00:59:25,736 --> 00:59:28,967
You couldn't get her on that stand now
with a gun in her back.

824
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,005
Then why don't we just quit.

825
00:59:31,175 --> 00:59:34,872
Wave a white flag out the window and
maybe Costain will be nice enough...

826
00:59:35,046 --> 00:59:37,446
...and not make us leave the country.

827
01:00:31,769 --> 01:00:33,066
Hi.

828
01:00:33,437 --> 01:00:34,836
Hi.

829
01:00:42,613 --> 01:00:43,875
How you feel?

830
01:00:44,649 --> 01:00:46,276
Terrible.

831
01:00:47,285 --> 01:00:49,651
I feel groggy all over.

832
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:51,852
Something funny has been going on.

833
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:55,356
I couldn't get that dopey from
the dinner I ate last night.

834
01:00:56,394 --> 01:00:59,761
I'm not gonna drink or eat
anything until I know what's in it.

835
01:00:59,931 --> 01:01:03,423
You couldn't live two hours
without eating. Here.

836
01:01:07,004 --> 01:01:10,599
Watch. If we're gonna go,
we'll go together.

837
01:01:12,109 --> 01:01:13,508
See?

838
01:01:13,811 --> 01:01:15,870
Drink it up.
It'll make you feel better.

839
01:01:16,047 --> 01:01:18,072
When's that gonna be?

840
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:20,611
How's the arm?

841
01:01:22,019 --> 01:01:24,920
Feels like somebody's been
gnawing on it with dull teeth.

842
01:01:25,089 --> 01:01:28,923
- Want the doctor?
- Only the one at the prison.

843
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:34,790
I've never been appreciative enough of
how free from killers those places are.

844
01:01:34,966 --> 01:01:36,456
How's Willoughby?

845
01:01:36,634 --> 01:01:39,102
Just the same, no change.

846
01:01:40,471 --> 01:01:41,904
Hey!

847
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:45,269
I got a surprise for you.

848
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:47,743
There.

849
01:01:49,313 --> 01:01:50,974
Well, go on, open it.

850
01:01:51,148 --> 01:01:52,410
What's in it?

851
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:55,552
It's sitting right in your lap.
Why don't you find out.

852
01:02:03,661 --> 01:02:05,424
White with polka dots!

853
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:07,894
Hey, you better look at it
sitting down, huh?

854
01:02:08,065 --> 01:02:10,226
No, I'm all right now.

855
01:02:12,570 --> 01:02:14,435
Good as the Easter parade, 1902?

856
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:16,197
Better.

857
01:02:17,341 --> 01:02:19,275
Hey, wait a minute.

858
01:02:19,443 --> 01:02:24,210
Could there be sentiments behind this
not kosher enough to write on a card?

859
01:02:24,382 --> 01:02:27,613
- What?
- Government officials bribing people?

860
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:31,221
- I thought it was the other way around.
- What are you talking about?

861
01:02:31,389 --> 01:02:37,089
Mr. Hallett thinks that polka dots will
make me forget that visitor last night?

862
01:02:37,495 --> 01:02:40,328
Oh, no wonder taxes keep going up.

863
01:02:40,498 --> 01:02:44,366
Nobody uses their brains anymore,
only their expense accounts.

864
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:47,898
Somebody's gonna get investigated.

865
01:02:48,406 --> 01:02:50,966
Well, did I stumble onto the motive?

866
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:54,134
If you say so, sister, all right.

867
01:02:55,046 --> 01:02:56,809
So it's "sister" again, is it?

868
01:02:57,281 --> 01:02:58,373
Yeah.

869
01:02:58,549 --> 01:03:02,986
I don't care how bad the motive is,
I won't let it upset my enjoyment.

870
01:03:03,154 --> 01:03:08,217
So, purely out of curiosity about the fit,
I'm gonna try it on.

871
01:03:08,392 --> 01:03:11,020
So you can tell Mr. Hallett
quite clearly...

872
01:03:11,195 --> 01:03:14,255
...that my acceptance of this
gift doesn't mean I intend...

873
01:03:14,432 --> 01:03:17,367
...to get caught dead
on his witness stand.

874
01:03:17,535 --> 01:03:19,730
The intervals are getting
irregulated again.

875
01:03:19,904 --> 01:03:22,498
Somebody better spring
for my breakfast.

876
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:42,023
- Well?
- For the fifth time, it looks great.

877
01:03:42,293 --> 01:03:44,625
I thought so too,
but I wanted another opinion.

878
01:03:44,795 --> 01:03:47,286
Your breakfast is out there.
You're not gonna eat?

879
01:03:47,465 --> 01:03:49,558
Lmagine me having to be told that.

880
01:03:49,734 --> 01:03:52,100
But I'm so excited,
I couldn't eat a drop.

881
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:02,270
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

882
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:04,379
Good morning.

883
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:11,110
Well, look at you.

884
01:04:11,288 --> 01:04:13,848
Yeah, I got it on me.

885
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:16,424
Turn around, let's see you.

886
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:24,129
That looks like about $200 worth
of dress.

887
01:04:24,502 --> 01:04:27,528
And a million dollars' worth of model.

888
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:30,101
Where'd you get it?

889
01:04:30,508 --> 01:04:33,136
- What?
- Where'd it come from?

890
01:04:34,612 --> 01:04:36,409
I thought you and the government...

891
01:04:38,816 --> 01:04:41,478
Like those grafters with
their expense accounts.

892
01:04:43,721 --> 01:04:46,884
You and that dress were certainly
made for each other.

893
01:04:53,364 --> 01:04:56,162
It's the nicest dress I ever owned.

894
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:59,300
More polka dots, for one thing.

895
01:05:03,207 --> 01:05:04,970
I'm sorry.

896
01:05:05,543 --> 01:05:07,909
I really mean it, I'm sorry.

897
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:15,445
- Where'd you get it?
- Get it?

898
01:05:15,619 --> 01:05:17,382
Oh, it wasn't any trouble, really.

899
01:05:17,555 --> 01:05:19,455
I called up a guy I know in Jersey...

900
01:05:19,623 --> 01:05:21,955
...got him out of bed at
4:00 in the morning...

901
01:05:22,126 --> 01:05:25,095
...he drove in, opened his shop,
took him a couple hours.

902
01:05:25,262 --> 01:05:27,162
Wasn't any trouble, really.

903
01:05:28,098 --> 01:05:30,999
- Vince...
- You like it?

904
01:05:31,168 --> 01:05:32,897
Like it?

905
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:35,129
He gave it to me.

906
01:05:37,508 --> 01:05:39,635
Well, that's nice.

907
01:05:44,014 --> 01:05:46,676
I wish I could wear it
to church this morning.

908
01:05:46,851 --> 01:05:48,614
You religious, Sherry?

909
01:05:48,786 --> 01:05:50,811
Doesn't look very much like it, does it?

910
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:53,320
They tried to get me
to go to church in prison.

911
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:56,722
What kind of place is that to go?
Can I have a cigarette?

912
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:59,827
Well, there was a time
when I was a kid...

913
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:02,557
...that I used to go to church
every Sunday.

914
01:06:06,704 --> 01:06:09,468
I hope you understood
I meant what I said last night...

915
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:11,164
...about going back to prison.

916
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:12,434
Miss Conley, believe...

917
01:06:12,610 --> 01:06:15,704
- I'm not fooled by this lull in the killing.
- But if Costain...

918
01:06:15,913 --> 01:06:19,246
Mr. Costain and I are both
interested in one law:

919
01:06:19,416 --> 01:06:23,443
The law of self-preservation.
You've heard of it. It's on the books.

920
01:06:23,621 --> 01:06:25,885
Yes, I've heard of it.

921
01:06:26,490 --> 01:06:28,321
I know what I'm asking is dangerous.

922
01:06:28,492 --> 01:06:30,756
Take it from the target,
it's very dangerous.

923
01:06:30,928 --> 01:06:33,453
I know. But until we get rid
of Costain for good...

924
01:06:33,631 --> 01:06:35,258
...someone's always at risk.

925
01:06:35,432 --> 01:06:39,869
Since that life happens to be mine,
you'll excuse me if I turn and run.

926
01:06:40,037 --> 01:06:42,028
Until somebody finally
has the courage...

927
01:06:42,206 --> 01:06:45,175
If somebody doesn't start
getting me back to my cell...

928
01:06:45,342 --> 01:06:48,368
...l'm gonna scream for lawyers.
- No!

929
01:06:48,913 --> 01:06:51,507
Wait another hour, just an hour.

930
01:06:51,682 --> 01:06:54,549
It'll take that long
to arrange the move anyway.

931
01:06:54,718 --> 01:06:56,208
Please.

932
01:06:57,021 --> 01:06:58,784
All right.
One hour.

933
01:06:58,956 --> 01:07:01,652
But after, I'm gonna stick my head
out that window...

934
01:07:01,825 --> 01:07:05,022
...and start screaming
for some advice of counsel.

935
01:07:08,465 --> 01:07:10,592
What happens in an hour?

936
01:07:10,768 --> 01:07:13,066
We've located her older sister.

937
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:15,364
One of my men
is on his way with her now.

938
01:07:15,539 --> 01:07:18,565
- And what can she do?
- That's what I'm trying to find out.

939
01:07:18,742 --> 01:07:21,802
Can't keep her much longer
if she keeps screaming to go back.

940
01:07:21,979 --> 01:07:23,913
Why not?
She's a prisoner, isn't she?

941
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:26,049
Prisoners have some rights, Vince.

942
01:07:26,216 --> 01:07:28,980
She wasn't sentenced to battle
the whole Costain mob.

943
01:07:29,153 --> 01:07:32,748
Good lawyer could beat my brains
for keeping her here against her will.

944
01:07:32,923 --> 01:07:36,120
Look, do you mind if I duck home,
get myself a clean shirt?

945
01:07:37,361 --> 01:07:39,124
- Who's on duty?
- Fred Packer.

946
01:07:39,296 --> 01:07:43,995
- He can take care of anything.
- All right, but don't stay away too long.

947
01:08:08,692 --> 01:08:10,387
Get in.

948
01:08:19,703 --> 01:08:22,763
Your sister doesn't know
that you're coming.

949
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:24,908
Yeah, that's what you said.

950
01:08:25,075 --> 01:08:26,565
Packer.

951
01:08:31,382 --> 01:08:33,907
- Make yourself at home.
- You want me to clear out?

952
01:08:34,084 --> 01:08:35,813
Thanks, Fred.

953
01:08:40,891 --> 01:08:43,655
- Shall I get her, Mr. Hallett?
- Yes.

954
01:08:44,595 --> 01:08:46,790
Won't you sit down, please?

955
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:50,689
Would you care for a...?

956
01:08:50,868 --> 01:08:55,134
Well, I had no idea criminals
were treated like this.

957
01:08:55,305 --> 01:08:56,795
It isn't always like that.

958
01:08:56,974 --> 01:09:00,000
Maybe Sherry's been right
and I was wrong.

959
01:09:00,177 --> 01:09:03,408
Maybe it doesn't pay to be an honest,
hardworking woman...

960
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:05,707
...who never gets
into any kind of trouble.

961
01:09:05,883 --> 01:09:08,283
She doesn't really mean that,
Mr. Hallett.

962
01:09:08,452 --> 01:09:12,081
She never believes she was wrong
about anything in her whole life.

963
01:09:12,256 --> 01:09:15,089
Hardworking Clara,
give you the shirt off her back...

964
01:09:15,259 --> 01:09:19,218
...if you pay her twice its worth.
- How are you, Sherry?

965
01:09:19,396 --> 01:09:23,492
Do you really care?
Or is that all you could think of to say?

966
01:09:23,667 --> 01:09:27,194
- It's been a long time, so...
- Yeah. How long has it been, Clara?

967
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:30,568
- Six years? Eight? Elev...?
- I was laid up for quite a while.

968
01:09:30,741 --> 01:09:34,233
Bust all your fingers, so you couldn't
write a letter or a postcard?

969
01:09:34,411 --> 01:09:36,845
Or maybe you didn't know
I was in prison.

970
01:09:37,014 --> 01:09:40,074
- Yeah, Roy heard about it somewhere.
- How is good old Roy?

971
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:43,481
- Still kicking kids for exercise?
- I better leave you two alone.

972
01:09:43,654 --> 01:09:46,054
No, stick around.
Because I want you to see...

973
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:49,420
...what a dumb move this was
on your part. What was the plan?

974
01:09:49,593 --> 01:09:53,120
That my loving sister was gonna
talk me into going into that court?

975
01:09:53,297 --> 01:09:55,697
There really wasn't any plan.
I merely thought...

976
01:09:55,866 --> 01:09:59,131
Well, you goofed, Mr. Hallett.
You'd have had to dug real deep...

977
01:09:59,303 --> 01:10:01,965
...to find anybody that had less
of a chance with me.

978
01:10:02,139 --> 01:10:05,540
Even if she could've talked me
into anything, think she would...

979
01:10:05,709 --> 01:10:08,735
...unless there's something for her?
- That's not true.

980
01:10:08,912 --> 01:10:12,109
Why isn't it?
You mean you've changed, Clara?

981
01:10:12,282 --> 01:10:15,115
These days you'd bust both
your arms to help somebody...

982
01:10:15,285 --> 01:10:18,482
...who was in trouble? And if
somebody needed a place to stay...

983
01:10:18,655 --> 01:10:20,987
...you'd throw open all your doors?

984
01:10:21,158 --> 01:10:23,683
It isn't my fault!
Roy didn't want you to stay!

985
01:10:23,861 --> 01:10:25,488
- I asked you!
- He's my husband!

986
01:10:25,662 --> 01:10:27,857
- It was his house!
- I knew it wasn't mine...

987
01:10:28,031 --> 01:10:29,498
...the way I was shoved out!

988
01:10:29,666 --> 01:10:32,601
That's the kind of sister to have.
She lets you know...

989
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:36,399
...not a soul cares if you live or die.
- And what was I supposed to do?

990
01:10:36,573 --> 01:10:39,633
If I'd insisted you stay,
he'd have thrown me out with you!

991
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:43,302
You wouldn't wanna chance losing
such a wonderful guy as that?

992
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:47,007
You bet I wouldn't! Things hadn't been
any easier for me than for you.

993
01:10:47,184 --> 01:10:50,915
If you think I wanted to lose the only
home I'd ever had, you were crazy!

994
01:10:51,088 --> 01:10:53,886
I was crazy, all right!
Because somewhere I'd heard...

995
01:10:54,057 --> 01:10:56,389
...that sisters mean something
to each other.

996
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,721
But you knocked that idea
out of my head...

997
01:10:58,896 --> 01:11:03,230
...before it felt at home there.
- We all had to look out for ourselves.

998
01:11:04,001 --> 01:11:06,765
Maybe it never occurred to you...

999
01:11:06,937 --> 01:11:10,703
...that if I'd had anything that even
looked like a home when I was 16...

1000
01:11:10,874 --> 01:11:14,037
...that maybe I wouldn't have
ended up in prison.

1001
01:11:14,678 --> 01:11:17,647
Yeah. Maybe I could have
amounted to something...

1002
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:20,477
...if I'd had even a little help then.

1003
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:23,586
- Put yourself in my place.
- With that guy?

1004
01:11:23,754 --> 01:11:26,279
- He's been good to me!
- What's he done for you?

1005
01:11:26,456 --> 01:11:29,152
Except let you carry out
the garbage when it rains.

1006
01:11:29,326 --> 01:11:31,851
He gave me a home
and some security.

1007
01:11:32,029 --> 01:11:35,157
And you ought to know what that
meant after years of living...

1008
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:39,234
...with Mom and Pop fighting.
- I just ran out of sympathy.

1009
01:11:39,403 --> 01:11:42,270
Oh, what difference does it make?

1010
01:11:42,439 --> 01:11:47,103
It's a real laugh that you thought
she could talk me into anything.

1011
01:11:47,277 --> 01:11:51,077
Oh, I didn't come up here
to talk you into testifying.

1012
01:11:52,749 --> 01:11:55,775
I came up here to beg you not to.

1013
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:01,988
Why?
Why do you care what I do?

1014
01:12:02,159 --> 01:12:06,596
I don't. I mean, I know I don't have any
right to interfere, but Roy wanted me...

1015
01:12:06,763 --> 01:12:09,527
Are you trying to tell me
that old nasty-heart cares...

1016
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:13,363
...whether I stick my neck out or not?
- It isn't that.

1017
01:12:13,537 --> 01:12:16,404
You see, we own a small barroom
of our own now.

1018
01:12:16,573 --> 01:12:18,700
Roy thinks
if you go against Costain...

1019
01:12:18,876 --> 01:12:22,903
...he'll take it out on anybody
who's connected with you in any way.

1020
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:24,945
Did you hear that?

1021
01:12:25,115 --> 01:12:27,242
I shouldn't testify
against Costain...

1022
01:12:27,417 --> 01:12:30,147
...because it might be bad
for Roy's business!

1023
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:32,515
- Yeah. Well, it might be.
- Oh, no!

1024
01:12:32,689 --> 01:12:34,816
You don't know how it is
in bar business...

1025
01:12:34,992 --> 01:12:38,018
...with all those licenses they can
take away at any time.

1026
01:12:38,195 --> 01:12:41,926
All Costain would have to do is pick up
a phone and ruin anybody he wants.

1027
01:12:42,099 --> 01:12:45,626
- And you've got the nerve to ask me...
- Makes no difference to you...

1028
01:12:45,802 --> 01:12:49,169
...and it does to us.
- Lf I could take a kick...

1029
01:12:49,339 --> 01:12:53,537
...at that miserable husband of yours
by getting up on that stand, I'd...

1030
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:55,041
- Get out of here!
- Please!

1031
01:12:55,212 --> 01:12:57,612
Of all the lousy...
Get out of here!

1032
01:12:57,781 --> 01:12:59,544
Oh, Mrs. Moran.

1033
01:13:00,817 --> 01:13:04,378
You brought me up here to let me
be insulted by some cheap dame...

1034
01:13:04,554 --> 01:13:07,955
...even if she is my sister?
- Lf you don't get out of here...

1035
01:13:08,125 --> 01:13:10,923
...you'll find I got a sister
with no hair and no teeth!

1036
01:13:11,094 --> 01:13:13,460
Roy was right!
You're no good, like Pop...

1037
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:16,064
...and you're not worth helping!

1038
01:13:32,849 --> 01:13:35,079
I'm sorry, Miss Conley.

1039
01:13:36,053 --> 01:13:38,920
Why do we always have to act
like this? Like wild dogs...

1040
01:13:39,089 --> 01:13:41,819
...instead of blood sisters?

1041
01:13:41,992 --> 01:13:45,018
- But it wasn't altogether your fault.
- No.

1042
01:13:45,195 --> 01:13:47,720
I went after her
the minute I came into this room.

1043
01:13:47,898 --> 01:13:51,595
It's always been like that. Every time
I even see her, I don't know...

1044
01:13:51,768 --> 01:13:55,898
...all those little hurts swell up in me.
- I could see that.

1045
01:13:56,073 --> 01:13:59,804
Did you see her? Like a scared rabbit,
afraid of everything.

1046
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:04,311
Do you think she's ever shown any
sisterly responsibility to me? No.

1047
01:14:04,481 --> 01:14:07,973
Because it might be a threat
to her lousy little security.

1048
01:14:08,151 --> 01:14:10,585
- Yeah, I know.
- And what has it got her?

1049
01:14:10,754 --> 01:14:14,747
Solitary confinement with that
low character she's married to.

1050
01:14:14,925 --> 01:14:20,522
What a life. I'll bet if she admitted it,
she's miserable.

1051
01:14:20,697 --> 01:14:23,495
That's the thing I've been
trying to point out to you...

1052
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:27,159
...about facing responsibilities.
- Yeah.

1053
01:14:34,244 --> 01:14:36,872
Oh, I get your point...

1054
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:41,740
...but you've gotta be sure
that they are your responsibilities.

1055
01:14:41,918 --> 01:14:43,818
And provided...

1056
01:14:43,987 --> 01:14:49,323
...that what you gotta do doesn't take
all the nerve in the world...

1057
01:14:49,493 --> 01:14:53,554
...which you haven't got.
- You've got plenty, Sherry.

1058
01:14:54,364 --> 01:14:56,355
It takes courage.

1059
01:14:56,533 --> 01:14:59,024
And you gotta be born with it.

1060
01:15:00,637 --> 01:15:04,334
Or maybe I was born with it
and got it kicked out of me...

1061
01:15:04,508 --> 01:15:09,468
...by certain close members
of my immediate, crummy family.

1062
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:44,604
Hold it, Arny.

1063
01:15:59,696 --> 01:16:03,132
He's mad at you
for killing his brother last night.

1064
01:16:05,035 --> 01:16:08,027
Doing everything your own way
these days, huh?

1065
01:16:08,505 --> 01:16:10,598
Why'd you shake the tail
on you yesterday?

1066
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:13,572
Made it harder for me to find
out where you'd taken her.

1067
01:16:13,743 --> 01:16:16,507
Because I had
a smart matron in the car.

1068
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:19,171
And that guy tailing me
was wearing a neon sign...

1069
01:16:19,349 --> 01:16:21,510
...to advertise he was following me.

1070
01:16:21,685 --> 01:16:23,778
And on top of this,
I guess you figured...

1071
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:26,821
...you didn't have enough
front-page publicity lately.

1072
01:16:26,990 --> 01:16:30,050
Or did you just want to show
how good you can pop a gun?

1073
01:16:30,227 --> 01:16:33,628
It was your boy trying to get a medal.
He didn't care who he shot.

1074
01:16:33,797 --> 01:16:37,733
- He was after the girl.
- Then he read his instructions wrong.

1075
01:16:37,901 --> 01:16:40,961
Or did he figure you wanted two
for the price of one?

1076
01:16:41,738 --> 01:16:45,333
Next time, let's make it clear to him
who his friends are, huh?

1077
01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:50,368
Lots of things
will be different next time.

1078
01:16:50,547 --> 01:16:52,845
- Who's the woman they brought in?
- Her sister.

1079
01:16:53,016 --> 01:16:55,109
What do they want with her?

1080
01:16:55,285 --> 01:16:58,743
Hallett figures maybe
she can talk the girl into testifying.

1081
01:16:58,922 --> 01:17:00,116
- Can she?
- I don't know.

1082
01:17:00,290 --> 01:17:03,350
I left before they got there.
You want my opinion?

1083
01:17:03,894 --> 01:17:06,294
Nobody's gonna talk her
into nothing.

1084
01:17:06,963 --> 01:17:09,090
You got nothing to worry about.

1085
01:17:09,266 --> 01:17:13,293
Can you imagine how that relieves
me to hear him say I shouldn't worry?

1086
01:17:13,470 --> 01:17:15,700
That's what I pay him for,
to reassure me.

1087
01:17:16,506 --> 01:17:20,738
If anything goes wrong, he can
always say it was just an opinion.

1088
01:17:22,479 --> 01:17:26,108
Both ends against the middle, that's
the way Vince likes to play things.

1089
01:17:26,283 --> 01:17:28,979
- You asked me...
- I asked you to get rid of the girl...

1090
01:17:29,152 --> 01:17:31,746
...so she couldn't bother us.
- I told you, let's...

1091
01:17:31,922 --> 01:17:34,482
- He told me.
...see if she is gonna bother us.

1092
01:17:34,658 --> 01:17:37,252
Guess you forgot to tell me
he's running things now.

1093
01:17:37,427 --> 01:17:40,760
- I didn't mean it like that.
- Didn't you?

1094
01:17:42,933 --> 01:17:45,026
It would suit you just fine,
wouldn't it?

1095
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:46,999
To see me booted
out of the country?

1096
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:50,105
Wouldn't that be a sweet cover-up
for a cop on the take...

1097
01:17:50,273 --> 01:17:51,865
...the past 10 years?

1098
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:55,808
To have his whole smelly past
put on a boat and sent someplace...

1099
01:17:55,979 --> 01:17:58,106
...where it couldn't ever
bother him again.

1100
01:17:58,281 --> 01:18:00,806
What do you want everybody's
neck sticking out for?

1101
01:18:00,984 --> 01:18:03,179
She's not gonna talk anyway.

1102
01:18:03,353 --> 01:18:07,881
Because I like everybody's
neck stuck out when mine is.

1103
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:13,788
Know what's gonna happen
if she gets on that stand, don't you?

1104
01:18:13,964 --> 01:18:17,058
Look, she hasn't even come close
to saying she'll testify.

1105
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:20,260
You haven't come close to saying
what you'll do if she does.

1106
01:18:20,437 --> 01:18:23,338
Mr. Costain wants to know
if he can depend on you.

1107
01:18:23,506 --> 01:18:27,203
- Do what? Shove her out the window?
- Lf that's what it has to be.

1108
01:18:27,377 --> 01:18:30,346
Sure, with Hallett and 20 cops
watching every minute.

1109
01:18:30,513 --> 01:18:32,640
And why should I,
when it isn't necessary?

1110
01:18:32,816 --> 01:18:36,217
Because as long as she's still
at the hotel, we can give you help.

1111
01:18:36,386 --> 01:18:38,877
After she's moved
to the city jail tonight...

1112
01:18:39,055 --> 01:18:43,321
...you'll have to do it all by yourself.
- Nobody's moving her to any city jail.

1113
01:18:43,493 --> 01:18:46,223
At 8:00 tonight, they are.

1114
01:18:46,396 --> 01:18:48,796
- How do you know?
- You know I make it a point...

1115
01:18:48,965 --> 01:18:51,798
...to know everything about everything
that concerns me.

1116
01:18:51,968 --> 01:18:55,665
So if you want any help, you'll have
to get it before they move her.

1117
01:18:55,839 --> 01:18:59,707
- There isn't any way it can be done.
- We'll show you.

1118
01:18:59,876 --> 01:19:02,003
I don't want you to miss a word.

1119
01:19:02,178 --> 01:19:04,772
Next time we meet,
it could be a big celebration...

1120
01:19:04,948 --> 01:19:07,178
...lots of money
being passed around...

1121
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:09,818
...or it could be the last look
at your face...

1122
01:19:09,986 --> 01:19:12,284
...before they start
shoveling dirt on it.

1123
01:19:13,089 --> 01:19:14,920
You made your point.

1124
01:19:15,091 --> 01:19:16,581
Good.

1125
01:19:17,727 --> 01:19:21,493
You do exactly like we tell you,
you'll be completely in the clear.

1126
01:19:21,665 --> 01:19:25,032
You don't have to do more than
you've been doing the past 10 years.

1127
01:19:25,201 --> 01:19:28,967
You just have to turn your back
and not worry about what's going on.

1128
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:30,629
Yeah.

1129
01:19:30,807 --> 01:19:35,403
- What do I do?
- Just unlock the bathroom window...

1130
01:19:35,578 --> 01:19:38,775
...a couple of minutes
before 8:00 tonight.

1131
01:19:38,948 --> 01:19:41,314
The time is important.

1132
01:19:41,484 --> 01:19:46,979
Right before 8:00 tonight,
you unlock the bathroom window.

1133
01:19:47,657 --> 01:19:51,286
That way, maybe you'll get to live
a couple of years more.

1134
01:20:02,405 --> 01:20:04,100
No, sir!

1135
01:20:04,274 --> 01:20:06,469
Not me, Mr. Hallett.

1136
01:20:06,643 --> 01:20:09,669
If you just gotta move somebody
back to the city jail, fine.

1137
01:20:09,846 --> 01:20:13,179
- But it's not gonna be me.
- Isn't my idea, I was ordered to do it.

1138
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:15,284
I don't care
who ordered you to do it.

1139
01:20:15,452 --> 01:20:17,613
The streets below
crawling with killers...

1140
01:20:17,787 --> 01:20:20,915
...and you wanna eject me
from my showers and room service...

1141
01:20:21,091 --> 01:20:23,889
...for a small, iron room
with only bars for comfort?

1142
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:27,791
No, Mr. Hallett.
And in case you weren't listening, no.

1143
01:20:27,964 --> 01:20:29,591
You're a prisoner.

1144
01:20:29,766 --> 01:20:31,961
And you'll do
exactly as you're told.

1145
01:20:32,502 --> 01:20:36,097
Only if what I'm told to do
is to go back to my nice, safe prison...

1146
01:20:36,272 --> 01:20:40,003
...where I spent so many years without
being shot at or wounded even once.

1147
01:20:40,176 --> 01:20:43,805
What difference could it make whether
you're moved there or city jail?

1148
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:47,347
Because moving to the city jail
is closer to the witness stand...

1149
01:20:47,517 --> 01:20:51,044
...which is the last place in the world
I've decided I'm gonna be.

1150
01:20:51,221 --> 01:20:53,348
- So that's really it, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1151
01:20:53,523 --> 01:20:55,787
Doesn't make any difference
about city jail.

1152
01:20:55,959 --> 01:20:59,793
You've decided that, as far as you're
concerned, everybody can go hang.

1153
01:20:59,963 --> 01:21:03,228
- I've been keeping this a secret?
- You've been stalling...

1154
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:06,665
...until you can take another shower
or chisel another $20 meal.

1155
01:21:06,836 --> 01:21:09,600
Look, who dragged who
from prison?

1156
01:21:09,773 --> 01:21:12,970
Is it my secret police that dragged
you from your safe prison...

1157
01:21:13,143 --> 01:21:15,805
...to live in front of live ammunition
for two days?

1158
01:21:15,979 --> 01:21:20,109
- What's all this supposed to mean?
- I want out of here!

1159
01:21:20,283 --> 01:21:21,807
But alive!

1160
01:21:21,985 --> 01:21:26,479
And I'm not gonna testify even if you
give me gold plates on silver platters!

1161
01:21:26,656 --> 01:21:29,090
- Hello.
- She has it in her power to get rid of...

1162
01:21:29,259 --> 01:21:32,194
...one of the biggest menaces,
but she simply won't do it.

1163
01:21:32,362 --> 01:21:36,059
Right, and I want that menace to start
hearing I'm not gonna do anything.

1164
01:21:36,232 --> 01:21:39,360
I want all the newspapers
to say I'm not gonna do anything!

1165
01:21:39,536 --> 01:21:42,096
So nothing matters to you
except your own hide?

1166
01:21:42,272 --> 01:21:44,331
- Take it easy.
- Take it easy nothing!

1167
01:21:44,507 --> 01:21:47,374
This is the kind of selfishness
that turns my stomach.

1168
01:21:47,544 --> 01:21:49,774
"Me, me, me!
What's gonna happen to me?"

1169
01:21:49,946 --> 01:21:53,677
She doesn't care if the world burns
as long as the flames don't touch her!

1170
01:21:53,850 --> 01:21:55,215
- Calm down.
- Don't stall...

1171
01:21:55,385 --> 01:21:58,548
...it doesn't take long
for a bullet to go through a brain!

1172
01:22:00,824 --> 01:22:02,314
Well...

1173
01:22:02,492 --> 01:22:04,483
...weren't you a help out there.

1174
01:22:04,661 --> 01:22:08,791
- Why didn't you pitch in and help?
- I think she's been pitched at enough.

1175
01:22:08,965 --> 01:22:10,956
- Oh, you do?
- Yes, I do.

1176
01:22:11,134 --> 01:22:13,261
Look, she almost
got killed last night.

1177
01:22:13,436 --> 01:22:16,530
You been slugging at her
with everything from fancy meals...

1178
01:22:16,706 --> 01:22:19,800
...to you telling her how low she is.
- Maybe I feel that way.

1179
01:22:19,976 --> 01:22:21,841
Maybe you haven't
got any right to.

1180
01:22:22,011 --> 01:22:24,138
It's her life, you know.

1181
01:22:24,948 --> 01:22:27,610
You've been working
as long as I have on this case.

1182
01:22:27,784 --> 01:22:31,652
And to all appearances, you felt just
as strongly as I about getting Costain.

1183
01:22:31,821 --> 01:22:34,483
What's happened
to change you all of a sudden?

1184
01:22:34,657 --> 01:22:38,024
Maybe I'm getting fed up with all
the shooting going on.

1185
01:22:38,194 --> 01:22:41,561
They killed Tonelli, shot Willoughby.
We've gotta take her to city jail.

1186
01:22:41,731 --> 01:22:45,030
You're just giving me more good
reasons to get Costain.

1187
01:22:45,201 --> 01:22:48,637
They might be reasons to us,
but that doesn't mean they are to her.

1188
01:22:48,805 --> 01:22:51,672
She's the one that's got to get up
on that witness stand.

1189
01:22:51,841 --> 01:22:53,741
Well, I'll shed a few tears.

1190
01:22:57,814 --> 01:23:01,750
How'd you happen to find out
about this move to the city jail?

1191
01:23:02,619 --> 01:23:04,177
What...? What do you mean?

1192
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:06,686
I just finished talking to Sherry
a minute ago.

1193
01:23:06,856 --> 01:23:10,485
- She's the only one I said a word...
- Mr. Hallett, phone.

1194
01:23:10,927 --> 01:23:12,485
All right.

1195
01:23:15,164 --> 01:23:19,066
While you're sitting there phoning, you
can tell the newspapers the status.

1196
01:23:19,235 --> 01:23:20,896
All right.

1197
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:23,334
There goes our last chance.

1198
01:23:24,707 --> 01:23:26,197
Vince.

1199
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:27,934
I'm sorry.

1200
01:23:28,111 --> 01:23:30,671
Maybe you could have been
police chief...

1201
01:23:30,847 --> 01:23:34,180
...or a senator from someplace if I
had enough courage.

1202
01:23:34,350 --> 01:23:36,443
Don't worry about it.

1203
01:23:37,387 --> 01:23:38,877
Thanks.

1204
01:23:39,522 --> 01:23:41,353
What's the matter?

1205
01:23:44,527 --> 01:23:47,291
Willoughby died 20 minutes ago.

1206
01:23:47,830 --> 01:23:50,594
They thought
she was rallying, but...

1207
01:23:52,635 --> 01:23:54,500
Oh, no.

1208
01:23:56,706 --> 01:24:00,870
She must have been trying to drag
me out of the way when she got hit.

1209
01:24:02,779 --> 01:24:05,213
And she didn't even
say anything...

1210
01:24:06,349 --> 01:24:09,284
...until the doc was through
with me.

1211
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,410
Me.

1212
01:24:13,356 --> 01:24:14,846
Me.

1213
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:18,390
The kind of person you could lose
any day in the week...

1214
01:24:18,561 --> 01:24:20,859
...and it still wouldn't
make any difference.

1215
01:24:22,298 --> 01:24:24,994
And who's gonna
take care of her daughter?

1216
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:34,337
Who does that crazy jerk
think he is anyway?

1217
01:24:34,510 --> 01:24:38,002
Killing off nice people
like Willoughby.

1218
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:41,974
He better be careful,
because somebody just might...

1219
01:24:42,151 --> 01:24:44,949
...run him out of this country,
where he really belongs.

1220
01:24:45,121 --> 01:24:47,783
And I think I know
who that somebody's gonna be.

1221
01:24:47,957 --> 01:24:52,417
- Now, wait a minute...
- You just got yourself a witness.

1222
01:25:04,407 --> 01:25:08,275
<i>Friends, because it's Sunday night</i>
<i>here and I'm still going strong...</i>

1223
01:25:08,444 --> 01:25:10,435
<i>... my enemies</i>
<i>have started a rumor...</i>

1224
01:25:10,613 --> 01:25:13,912
<i>... that I haven't been on the job every</i>
<i>minute, that I nap...</i>

1225
01:25:14,083 --> 01:25:15,550
<i>... during the news bulletins.</i>

1226
01:25:15,718 --> 01:25:17,686
<i>Now, you folks know me</i>
<i>better than that.</i>

1227
01:25:17,854 --> 01:25:20,687
<i>I just don't play that kind</i>
<i>of dirty mahjong.</i>

1228
01:25:22,058 --> 01:25:23,548
Fred.

1229
01:25:26,095 --> 01:25:28,256
Really rotten news
about Willoughby.

1230
01:25:28,431 --> 01:25:30,296
- Yeah.
- How many more will we lose...

1231
01:25:30,466 --> 01:25:31,899
...in this move to the jail?

1232
01:25:32,068 --> 01:25:36,266
There's more guys coming.
Show them what you want them to do.

1233
01:25:36,439 --> 01:25:40,000
You wanna make a bet that she never
gets to the city jail alive?

1234
01:25:40,176 --> 01:25:43,475
I was only kidding, Vince.
Forget it.

1235
01:25:59,729 --> 01:26:00,787
Masters?

1236
01:26:00,963 --> 01:26:02,658
- Yeah?
- What's Conley doing now?

1237
01:26:02,832 --> 01:26:05,960
Changing her clothes
for the trip to the jail.

1238
01:26:06,436 --> 01:26:09,633
She says if there's shooting,
she doesn't wanna take a chance...

1239
01:26:09,806 --> 01:26:11,797
...with her new dress.

1240
01:26:29,358 --> 01:26:32,555
- Yeah?
- It's Vince. Can I come in?

1241
01:26:33,229 --> 01:26:35,754
Sure, I'm decent enough for you.

1242
01:26:41,003 --> 01:26:44,200
I was hoping I'd get a chance to see
you before D-day starts.

1243
01:26:44,373 --> 01:26:46,841
It's another let-out job.

1244
01:26:47,009 --> 01:26:51,412
Listen, how do you know Willoughby
wants you to get up on that stand?

1245
01:26:51,581 --> 01:26:54,379
Why shouldn't she want me
to get the guy who killed her?

1246
01:26:54,550 --> 01:26:58,213
She'd have been able to see
that all you'll do is get yourself killed.

1247
01:26:58,855 --> 01:27:00,447
I suppose that...

1248
01:27:00,623 --> 01:27:03,285
...in all the years
Mr. Costain has been a hotshot...

1249
01:27:03,459 --> 01:27:07,293
...there've been lots of people that
could've stopped him along the way.

1250
01:27:07,463 --> 01:27:10,159
But for some reason,
nobody ever did.

1251
01:27:10,333 --> 01:27:12,824
So now the buck has been passed
right on down...

1252
01:27:13,002 --> 01:27:15,527
- Yeah, but you didn't ask for it.
- But I got it.

1253
01:27:15,705 --> 01:27:18,902
- So, what am I gonna do?
- Who says it's up to you anyway?

1254
01:27:19,075 --> 01:27:22,442
Well, Mr. Hallett
keeps saying it all along.

1255
01:27:23,379 --> 01:27:27,076
And I guess right now
I'm saying it myself.

1256
01:27:40,496 --> 01:27:43,693
- What are you doing?
- Checking everything.

1257
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,560
Even if we're gonna move me?

1258
01:27:46,736 --> 01:27:49,000
We've still got half an hour.

1259
01:27:49,839 --> 01:27:51,966
Sherry, don't do it.

1260
01:27:52,408 --> 01:27:55,536
Don't worry about me, Vince.
I know what I'm getting into.

1261
01:27:55,711 --> 01:27:57,042
No, you don't.

1262
01:27:57,213 --> 01:28:01,240
Well, let's say it's 10 times worse
than I think it is now.

1263
01:28:01,417 --> 01:28:04,784
I'd still go ahead with it
because for the first time in my life...

1264
01:28:04,954 --> 01:28:08,321
...l'm facing up to something.
I kind of like the feeling.

1265
01:28:08,491 --> 01:28:09,981
Anyway...

1266
01:28:10,393 --> 01:28:13,419
...the nicest thing
that ever happened to me is that...

1267
01:28:13,596 --> 01:28:16,895
...you care whether I live or die.

1268
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:22,103
I don't expect you to feel this way
for the rest of your life...

1269
01:28:22,271 --> 01:28:24,933
...or even five days from now...

1270
01:28:25,107 --> 01:28:27,701
...but I would
just like to tell you that...

1271
01:28:27,877 --> 01:28:30,903
...I think it's nice
that you feel that way now.

1272
01:28:35,084 --> 01:28:38,713
Maybe this isn't exactly the time...

1273
01:28:39,589 --> 01:28:42,251
...but I just wanted to tell you.

1274
01:29:42,485 --> 01:29:43,975
Vince.

1275
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:47,517
- I wish you wouldn't be sore at me.
- For what?

1276
01:29:47,690 --> 01:29:49,317
For feeling this way about you.

1277
01:29:49,492 --> 01:29:52,017
I wouldn't hold you to anything
after this is over.

1278
01:29:52,194 --> 01:29:53,525
I'm not sore.

1279
01:29:53,696 --> 01:29:56,062
But with this move to the city jail...

1280
01:29:56,232 --> 01:30:00,032
...maybe this will be our last chance
to say anything.

1281
01:30:01,871 --> 01:30:04,533
<i>$ 10 if you'll sing</i>
<i>"The Girl From Cactus Valley."</i>

1282
01:30:04,707 --> 01:30:07,267
<i>Well, what are we</i>
<i>waiting on, fellas?</i>

1283
01:30:30,232 --> 01:30:33,963
- Harris!
- Yes, sir? Sorry, sir.

1284
01:30:34,136 --> 01:30:36,468
Would you turn that down?

1285
01:30:45,414 --> 01:30:48,178
<i>Timers are set</i>
<i>for as long as you need.</i>

1286
01:30:52,455 --> 01:30:56,414
Portrait of a modern man at war
with the machine age.

1287
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:00,785
- How is she?
- Leave her alone!

1288
01:31:01,230 --> 01:31:03,061
She's getting dressed.

1289
01:31:04,133 --> 01:31:06,124
Shouldn't that door be open?

1290
01:31:06,302 --> 01:31:10,102
Well, she's been screaming about not
getting privacy when she's dressing.

1291
01:31:15,277 --> 01:31:17,108
Well, I...

1292
01:31:19,015 --> 01:31:23,179
I thought she might like a hat
to go with that dress that you...

1293
01:31:23,386 --> 01:31:26,321
Well, there's that little shop
downstairs and...

1294
01:31:30,359 --> 01:31:31,986
I don't know why...

1295
01:31:32,161 --> 01:31:36,097
...but these things give women
some kind of strange courage.

1296
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,891
- Pretty awful, isn't it?
- Terrible.

1297
01:31:40,069 --> 01:31:41,559
Yeah.

1298
01:32:04,927 --> 01:32:08,488
You've gotten to think quite a lot
of that third-class citizen.

1299
01:32:08,664 --> 01:32:11,497
Almost always turns out that way.

1300
01:32:25,014 --> 01:32:28,575
Make a snap judgment of someone,
break them way down...

1301
01:32:29,351 --> 01:32:31,615
...then you find them
acting out so well...

1302
01:32:31,787 --> 01:32:34,984
...wonder how you had nerve
to grade them in the first place.

1303
01:32:37,193 --> 01:32:39,957
I never thought I'd see you
acting coy about anything.

1304
01:32:40,129 --> 01:32:41,994
Will you stop it?

1305
01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:53,335
We're all on edge.

1306
01:32:54,043 --> 01:32:57,570
Maybe we'll all go away
someplace after the trial.

1307
01:32:58,514 --> 01:33:00,880
You've been getting jumpy.

1308
01:33:01,383 --> 01:33:05,376
Besides, you could be with her all the
time, see that nothing happens to her.

1309
01:33:05,554 --> 01:33:09,217
You wouldn't be worried if you were
taking care of her yourself.

1310
01:33:09,391 --> 01:33:11,586
Why don't you leave her alone!

1311
01:33:13,262 --> 01:33:15,492
What's the matter, Vince?

1312
01:33:16,198 --> 01:33:19,395
Nothing! Nothing's the matter
except you kept hammering at her!

1313
01:33:19,568 --> 01:33:22,696
Wouldn't let her make up her mind!
So when she gets killed...

1314
01:33:33,616 --> 01:33:35,106
Vince!

1315
01:33:35,784 --> 01:33:37,274
Vince!

1316
01:33:37,786 --> 01:33:39,276
Vince!

1317
01:33:47,029 --> 01:33:50,192
This bathroom window
was unlocked from the inside.

1318
01:34:12,388 --> 01:34:15,516
Vince, Vince, Vince.

1319
01:34:22,598 --> 01:34:25,931
I don't think he expected
to find you here this morning.

1320
01:34:26,335 --> 01:34:29,133
There were times when I didn't expect
to be here myself.

1321
01:34:29,305 --> 01:34:30,795
Scared?

1322
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:32,730
No.

1323
01:34:32,908 --> 01:34:35,240
Just mad.

1324
01:34:44,787 --> 01:34:47,950
Will the government
call its next witness, please?

1325
01:34:48,757 --> 01:34:50,850
Miss Sherry Conley.

1326
01:34:51,227 --> 01:34:53,024
Here we go.

1327
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:00,494
Undesirable alien.

1328
01:35:06,041 --> 01:35:08,532
Do you swear the evidence
you're to give...

1329
01:35:08,711 --> 01:35:11,646
...before this court
will be the truth, the whole truth...

1330
01:35:11,814 --> 01:35:13,338
...and nothing but the truth?

1331
01:35:13,515 --> 01:35:15,107
I do.

1332
01:35:18,887 --> 01:35:20,787
Your name, please.

1333
01:35:20,956 --> 01:35:22,924
Sherry Conley.

1334
01:35:23,092 --> 01:35:25,287
What is your present address?

1335
01:35:26,095 --> 01:35:28,723
Upstate Women's Prison.

1336
01:35:30,266 --> 01:35:31,824
Occupation?

1337
01:35:33,402 --> 01:35:35,233
At present...

1338
01:35:35,404 --> 01:35:37,634
...gangbuster.
