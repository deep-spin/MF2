1
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,070
What are you doing here?

2
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,326
Get out! This is my house!

3
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:10,329
You speak English?

4
00:06:10,747 --> 00:06:12,706
Do you want to ruin me?

5
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,168
Go! Go, or I will call the police!

6
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,338
We - We no enemies!

7
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,501
You are English, aren't you?

8
00:06:22,701 --> 00:06:25,462
You can only make trouble for me!

9
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:36,605
Please, Signore... you must help us...

10
00:06:37,816 --> 00:06:41,819
What do you take me for?
I have to protect myself.

11
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:49,094
We... yesterday... railroad...

12
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:56,326
We thought... goodbye, Italy,
but then...

13
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,251
We - We very hungry.

14
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:13,226
My wife! She must not know
you are here.

15
00:07:14,162 --> 00:07:18,165
I'll bring food. Then you must go.
Understand?

16
00:10:15,635 --> 00:10:17,277
What are you carting today?

17
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:18,854
Wheat, why?

18
00:13:01,371 --> 00:13:03,631
Hey! Are you asleep? Stop!

19
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:05,341
Why? You know me.

20
00:13:06,226 --> 00:13:07,967
Good morning, Alfredo!

21
00:13:08,194 --> 00:13:11,863
Don't be foolish, children,
let me through.

22
00:13:13,324 --> 00:13:17,535
I am traveling for the State
and I am late already.

23
00:13:24,995 --> 00:13:28,539
Shut up and pay attention!
What have you to declare?

24
00:13:29,092 --> 00:13:31,834
Sugar... eggs... macaroni... rice...

25
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,849
...coffe... tea... and roast chickens.

26
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:40,412
The whole black market...
legal and illegal!

27
00:13:40,412 --> 00:13:41,736
Inspect each bag!

28
00:13:47,551 --> 00:13:48,645
Hands off my sacks!

29
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:57,986
Read this... if you <i>can</i> read.

30
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:02,791
What does it say there?
<i>State Mills</i>, it says.

31
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:08,922
Would you have the courage to touch
Government property?

32
00:14:10,191 --> 00:14:13,929
You dare suspect that the bags
contain contraband?

33
00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:17,551
My poor friend!
Suppose I should report you...

34
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:21,621
...and accuse you of mistrusting
a Government official.

35
00:14:21,871 --> 00:14:24,474
You would get at least
five years hard labor!

36
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,777
But I am too good-natured...

37
00:14:28,485 --> 00:14:30,611
Why didn't you speak up before?

38
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:36,636
Did I or didn't I say
that I was working for the State?

39
00:14:36,636 --> 00:14:38,103
All right, let him go.

40
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:49,256
What did you think I had in my cart?
Englishmen, perhaps?

41
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:55,582
If you want to see Englishmen...
go to Calabria!

42
00:14:55,582 --> 00:14:58,315
There you will find
as many as you wish!

43
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,616
Run for it.

44
00:18:41,975 --> 00:18:43,484
Don't be afraid.

45
00:18:57,674 --> 00:18:58,700
Are you English?

46
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,778
Yes... and it is too bad
I don't talk much Italian.

47
00:19:03,639 --> 00:19:06,883
I learned only a few words at camp.

48
00:19:06,883 --> 00:19:11,345
"How are you?" "It is warm today."
"Cigarettes." "To eat, to eat."

49
00:19:12,372 --> 00:19:13,830
And... "pretty girl".

50
00:19:14,007 --> 00:19:16,008
You speak Italian <i>very</i> well.

51
00:19:19,988 --> 00:19:22,609
There, other shore... Switzerland?

52
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:24,777
Oh, no, much further.

53
00:19:27,304 --> 00:19:28,972
And it is dangerous.

54
00:19:30,048 --> 00:19:33,319
Something always happens.
You understand?

55
00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:35,806
Dangerous... many soldiers.

56
00:19:38,082 --> 00:19:40,542
We will go only at night.

57
00:19:43,212 --> 00:19:46,840
They have many boats...
they patrol about 10 o'clock.

58
00:19:49,953 --> 00:19:54,850
Calabria is too far away...
there is only Switzerland.

59
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,918
Switzerland... that is a lucky country.

60
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:03,024
War is so horrible... But my father
hopes for peace soon.

61
00:20:06,978 --> 00:20:09,765
Someday I want to come back
to Italy.

62
00:25:23,036 --> 00:25:26,914
Hey, Johnny! Come back! Come back!

63
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:35,433
<i>Ar... mis... tice!</i>

64
00:26:08,101 --> 00:26:09,077
Isn't this risky?

65
00:26:09,077 --> 00:26:12,639
Oh, no! Allied prisoners
are in town celebrating.

66
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:16,643
They are crazy with joy!
The War has ended!

67
00:26:40,727 --> 00:26:42,103
What happened?

68
00:28:15,567 --> 00:28:16,801
Wait here.

69
00:28:19,121 --> 00:28:22,400
Uncle! Come down quickly!

70
00:28:30,046 --> 00:28:33,885
Englishmen? You crazy?
The Germans are here!

71
00:28:33,885 --> 00:28:35,278
You have to help them!

72
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:38,655
Easy...
first they need civilian clothes.

73
00:28:43,361 --> 00:28:46,196
Have you some old suits for them?

74
00:28:48,583 --> 00:28:50,042
You two wait here.

75
00:29:21,097 --> 00:29:23,301
Don't try to cross the lake!

76
00:29:23,701 --> 00:29:27,034
You must reach Switzerland
through the mountains.

77
00:29:27,071 --> 00:29:28,864
Get to the railroad!

78
00:29:34,627 --> 00:29:38,296
With luck, you may find
a freight car to hide in.

79
00:32:10,184 --> 00:32:14,388
Let me through!
Let me go with my husband!

80
00:32:19,533 --> 00:32:23,610
No, no, don't! What you are doing
won't help us any.

81
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:15,654
We are escaped prisoners.

82
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:16,930
English?

83
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:18,847
I am. He is American.

84
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,486
Where do you want to go?

85
00:34:22,486 --> 00:34:23,246
Switzerland.

86
00:34:23,546 --> 00:34:25,813
Let them go... they are all right.

87
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,188
Is the frontier open?

88
00:34:31,388 --> 00:34:35,525
Yes, hurry. The Germans may patrol here
any moment.

89
00:34:39,461 --> 00:34:43,983
Be careful in town.
You may endanger our people.

90
00:36:00,712 --> 00:36:02,171
Can I help you?

91
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:06,225
We are looking...
My friend... and I...

92
00:36:08,696 --> 00:36:11,397
Perhaps you prefer to speak French?

93
00:36:12,491 --> 00:36:13,950
You are English?

94
00:36:15,394 --> 00:36:17,389
And my friend is American.

95
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:21,468
We didn't know where to go,
so we came here.

96
00:36:21,725 --> 00:36:22,661
You did well.

97
00:36:22,661 --> 00:36:24,880
But... we are not Catholics.

98
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,657
That doesn't matter.

99
00:36:29,751 --> 00:36:34,337
They said we could reach Switzerland
this way. True?

100
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,887
But you are not the only ones
who want to get there.

101
00:36:38,887 --> 00:36:41,220
Every day there are more fugitives.

102
00:37:02,727 --> 00:37:04,728
There is nothing to fear.

103
00:37:10,368 --> 00:37:13,998
In any case, you can't go
any further tonight.

104
00:37:14,598 --> 00:37:19,194
It will do you good to rest...
you look exhausted.

105
00:37:22,096 --> 00:37:26,220
We are very tired, but by tomorrow
we will be all right.

106
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,404
I shall do my best for you.

107
00:37:30,606 --> 00:37:34,609
I have another guest...
an interesting one.

108
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:57,115
You have returned. What happened?

109
00:37:57,333 --> 00:38:01,920
A terrible snow storm in the mountains
forced us back.

110
00:38:02,756 --> 00:38:03,899
Where is Giuseppe?

111
00:38:03,899 --> 00:38:05,101
At the Inn.

112
00:38:05,301 --> 00:38:08,588
We are desperate!
For Heaven's sake, help us!

113
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:13,332
Go to the Inn... You're soaked.
I'll join you shortly.

114
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:23,634
I have an idea...

115
00:38:26,714 --> 00:38:31,343
Come with me. I'll get you one
who knows the way.

116
00:38:38,718 --> 00:38:41,386
We must cross the street very quickly.

117
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:55,770
I am afraid we are giving you
a lot of trouble.

118
00:38:55,970 --> 00:39:00,016
Don't be afraid.
We're here to help each other.

119
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:02,501
One must not magnify one's fears.

120
00:39:05,438 --> 00:39:10,108
Much would not have happened
if we had been less afraid.

121
00:39:12,211 --> 00:39:13,879
I shall cross first.

122
00:39:53,302 --> 00:39:55,970
Giuseppe! The Priest is here.

123
00:39:57,222 --> 00:39:59,891
I understand how unpleasant
this waiting is.

124
00:40:02,695 --> 00:40:07,323
I know those mountains.
People freeze to death there.

125
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:10,737
They don't realize the danger!

126
00:40:12,148 --> 00:40:15,050
The Germans are getting closer,
Father!

127
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,887
At any moment they may arrive here!

128
00:40:22,383 --> 00:40:26,251
You are not the only one
who is in danger.

129
00:40:31,733 --> 00:40:34,819
But how much longer
must we wait here?

130
00:40:35,212 --> 00:40:37,797
Giuseppe, can you start out
tomorrow?

131
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,902
Maybe, but I can't promise.

132
00:40:39,902 --> 00:40:43,197
Now I am going back home
to see my mother.

133
00:40:43,821 --> 00:40:47,449
When the weather improves
I'll come for these people.

134
00:40:51,554 --> 00:40:54,592
There is somebody else
who wants to join you.

135
00:40:54,892 --> 00:40:59,105
A young Englishman who came to me
with his friend.

136
00:41:00,698 --> 00:41:03,918
This is Giuseppe.
You can speak in English.

137
00:41:05,144 --> 00:41:06,811
He lived in America once.

138
00:41:09,899 --> 00:41:14,018
Giuseppe will tell you everything
you need to know.

139
00:41:15,788 --> 00:41:18,684
Must you take all with you?

140
00:41:18,984 --> 00:41:21,636
We will leave behind what we can.

141
00:41:26,883 --> 00:41:30,837
I collected these papers
for thirty years, Father.

142
00:41:32,037 --> 00:41:36,624
These papers are more important
than my life.

143
00:41:47,056 --> 00:41:50,523
DEVELOPMENT OF EUROPE'S
MINORITY PROBLEM SINCE 1815

144
00:42:25,403 --> 00:42:28,840
Go to sleep... I will mend
your stockings when they dry.

145
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,708
After my prayers
may I have a Zwieback?

146
00:42:35,989 --> 00:42:39,892
Wait... don't run barefoot
over the cold floor.

147
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:43,468
I will carry you piggyback.

148
00:43:25,265 --> 00:43:27,007
They are staying here.

149
00:43:27,426 --> 00:43:30,012
That would endanger the inn-keeper.

150
00:43:30,212 --> 00:43:32,089
You will stay with me.

151
00:43:33,699 --> 00:43:37,636
Meanwhile, I am going to get you
something to eat.

152
00:43:37,836 --> 00:43:41,474
When you get to the church,
go upstairs.

153
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:44,291
You will find somebody there.

154
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:49,440
Go ahead... there is nothing to fear.

155
00:43:55,604 --> 00:43:59,607
We were sent here...
Does the Priest happen to be here?

156
00:44:10,562 --> 00:44:12,497
I have a letter for you.

157
00:44:26,546 --> 00:44:29,482
I believe you can stay here.

158
00:47:40,212 --> 00:47:42,547
Careful, Father... that puddle.

159
00:47:44,692 --> 00:47:47,986
Bad weather... bad times.

160
00:47:51,374 --> 00:47:53,375
Those people at the Inn...

161
00:47:53,577 --> 00:47:56,628
Your "proteges"...
they haven't left yet, eh?

162
00:47:57,014 --> 00:47:58,941
They are probably leaving tomorrow.

163
00:47:58,941 --> 00:48:02,674
Oh, there is no rush. Right now
they are not in danger.

164
00:48:05,763 --> 00:48:08,390
Two new ones arrived tonight,
didn't they?

165
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:12,588
Yes, a poor woman and her son.

166
00:48:12,930 --> 00:48:17,224
A few days ago she lost her husband...
he was deported.

167
00:48:18,711 --> 00:48:21,963
She was on their list, too,
but she was warned.

168
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,533
These stories make your blood boil.

169
00:48:27,855 --> 00:48:32,515
They'll pay for their crimes
sooner or later.

170
00:48:34,327 --> 00:48:37,788
Tell me, it is Giuseppe
who will guide them, isn't it?

171
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:41,333
Ah, Giuseppe knows his business.

172
00:48:41,693 --> 00:48:46,322
You're kind to take
these poor people's fate to heart.

173
00:48:50,402 --> 00:48:53,548
Thank Heaven
you have nothing to fear.

174
00:48:53,748 --> 00:48:56,881
After all,
they are not military refugees.

175
00:50:58,587 --> 00:51:01,197
You see, I have not forgotten you.

176
00:51:07,787 --> 00:51:12,458
We leave tomorrow...
these two and myself. It's better.

177
00:51:25,073 --> 00:51:29,066
Father... that man...
isn't he a suspicious character?

178
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:38,211
Not long ago he changed
his political opinions.

179
00:51:38,877 --> 00:51:42,741
<i>It's official. The coup at Gran Sasso
has succeeded.</i>

180
00:51:42,741 --> 00:51:44,359
<i>Il Duce is free!</i>

181
00:51:44,617 --> 00:51:49,079
<i>Badoglio's plan to give him
to the Allies failed.</i>

182
00:51:50,891 --> 00:51:54,703
<i>The German paratroopers and the SS
made the attack.</i>

183
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:03,160
<i>No doubt the maneuver
was carefully planned.</i>

184
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:10,334
<i>The troops landed
without arousing suspicion.</i>

185
00:52:10,611 --> 00:52:14,489
<i>Keep tuned to this station.
More details will follow.</i>

186
00:52:25,259 --> 00:52:27,218
What am I to do now?

187
00:52:28,779 --> 00:52:30,822
Nothing! Absolutely nothing!

188
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,486
Don't mix in politics anymore!

189
00:52:37,455 --> 00:52:39,456
<i>You</i> of all people say that?

190
00:52:39,474 --> 00:52:44,061
Tell me, who made money for us?
Who gave us position?

191
00:52:46,105 --> 00:52:48,843
While the Fascist party existed
we did well.

192
00:52:48,843 --> 00:52:51,403
When it collapsed,
what happened to me?

193
00:52:51,403 --> 00:52:55,365
Once I had power and influence.
Now nothing.

194
00:52:58,235 --> 00:53:01,070
They all avoided me...
even the Priest!

195
00:53:03,634 --> 00:53:05,959
I haven't forgotten his sermons.

196
00:53:06,503 --> 00:53:11,131
All he did was denounce informers...
profiteers... bribers.

197
00:53:14,226 --> 00:53:16,863
Those speeches were for <i>my</i> benefit.

198
00:53:22,427 --> 00:53:25,982
But listen... things are different
again, I assure you.

199
00:53:25,982 --> 00:53:28,919
Now it is <i>their</i> turn to lick <i>my</i> boots!

200
00:53:31,194 --> 00:53:32,778
I am going to the valley.

201
00:53:35,132 --> 00:53:38,885
And if anyone asks where I am,
you don't know.

202
00:54:44,395 --> 00:54:46,021
Did you hear that, Father?

203
00:54:46,272 --> 00:54:48,607
Yes, yes.
But where are they shooting from?

204
00:54:48,975 --> 00:54:52,637
Not far from here.
Near the bridge, I think.

205
00:54:52,637 --> 00:54:56,098
Not the bridge.
They can't be that close.

206
00:54:58,810 --> 00:55:02,438
You are right!
That means they are coming here!

207
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:08,119
They are attacking the village!
You must leave immediately!

208
00:55:27,048 --> 00:55:28,006
They are coming!

209
00:55:28,426 --> 00:55:31,143
The whole village must be evacuated!

210
00:55:31,569 --> 00:55:34,571
Our men can't hold them off
much longer!

211
00:56:06,973 --> 00:56:10,559
Maria! Get the children,
and some clothing! Hurry!

212
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:02,169
Father, what about the children?

213
00:57:05,169 --> 00:57:06,829
They will stay with me.

214
00:57:07,883 --> 00:57:12,011
The old people stay too.
The rest hide in the woods.

215
00:57:28,062 --> 00:57:32,649
What! No guide for the people!
Giuseppe isn't here!

216
00:57:33,109 --> 00:57:37,362
Send them all to the church.
Quickly, please!

217
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:50,419
You have to leave, too, Father!
You can't stay here!

218
00:57:50,419 --> 00:57:53,764
Be calm. Ring for Mass... it is time.

219
00:58:02,105 --> 00:58:05,274
Remember those people you saw
at the Inn?

220
00:58:05,918 --> 00:58:07,794
Well, they are outside.

221
00:58:09,007 --> 00:58:11,634
They must get to Giuseppe,
the guide.

222
00:58:14,643 --> 00:58:17,270
I beg you, Gentlemen,
take them with you.

223
00:58:22,535 --> 00:58:25,203
Impossible. We can't take them.

224
00:58:25,431 --> 00:58:28,717
They will never find their way
all alone.

225
00:58:30,496 --> 00:58:35,072
It's not far to Giuseppe's village...
then you're free.

226
00:58:38,168 --> 00:58:40,313
After all, they are fugitives, too.

227
00:59:22,766 --> 00:59:24,426
Alright, we will take them.

228
00:59:24,526 --> 00:59:25,877
God bless you!

229
00:59:26,077 --> 00:59:29,272
These men will take you to the guide.

230
00:59:44,303 --> 00:59:47,415
Go that way and continue
beyond the wood!

231
00:59:47,415 --> 00:59:51,418
You will find a few houses...
ask anyone for Giuseppe!

232
01:02:05,292 --> 01:02:08,294
Father... they are waiting for you
outside.

233
01:02:11,265 --> 01:02:14,350
I... I have to conduct you to them.

234
01:02:19,290 --> 01:02:22,209
You mean... I am under arrest?

235
01:02:22,668 --> 01:02:26,630
Why didn't you go, too?
I thought you had gone.

236
01:02:27,649 --> 01:02:31,235
You know perfectly well
that I would have stayed on.

237
01:02:36,725 --> 01:02:40,645
In these last years
I have seen many horrible things.

238
01:02:41,605 --> 01:02:45,399
I knew that sooner or later
they'd spare nobody.

239
01:02:47,202 --> 01:02:49,871
And now... my hour has come.

240
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:54,133
I swear on my own soul
I didn't want this!

241
01:02:55,836 --> 01:02:57,462
Will you permit me to see
my little flock just once more?

242
01:05:04,069 --> 01:05:07,363
It is deserted...
There is not a soul anywhere.

243
01:05:07,698 --> 01:05:10,032
But the guide must be here.

244
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:40,816
Try to understand...
Where is the guide?

245
01:06:40,942 --> 01:06:42,234
Where is Giuseppe?

246
01:06:47,958 --> 01:06:49,041
My son...

247
01:06:54,323 --> 01:06:55,615
Dead... dead.

248
01:07:03,332 --> 01:07:07,088
They came at midnight
and ransacked the village.

249
01:07:07,088 --> 01:07:09,264
They found only one shotgun!

250
01:07:09,856 --> 01:07:11,106
For that, they murdered our men
and burned our homes.

251
01:07:19,572 --> 01:07:21,907
Where did they go?
Toward the frontier?

252
01:07:22,241 --> 01:07:25,577
No, no, no! They went that way
over the mountains!

253
01:07:26,437 --> 01:07:27,472
How many were there?

254
01:07:27,472 --> 01:07:28,972
Many... many... many.

255
01:07:43,672 --> 01:07:47,675
Let me show you
what these beasts are capable of!

256
01:08:12,677 --> 01:08:15,345
That guide was our only hope.

257
01:08:16,913 --> 01:08:18,914
We will never make it now.

258
01:08:19,309 --> 01:08:23,604
If we were alone,
I'd try finding our way.

259
01:08:25,774 --> 01:08:29,836
But if you get lost in this weather,
you are finished.

260
01:08:29,836 --> 01:08:33,130
We can't just <i>talk!</i>
We must keep going!

261
01:08:33,307 --> 01:08:35,266
And those soldiers have a map.

262
01:08:35,475 --> 01:08:38,769
Oh, those Englishmen!
They only think of themselves!

263
01:08:38,979 --> 01:08:41,898
It is so, isn't it?
You heard them yourself.

264
01:08:42,507 --> 01:08:45,759
What are we to them?
"A lot of jerks!"

265
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,495
I beg you,
take these children with you!

266
01:09:33,395 --> 01:09:35,462
They have no homes! No parents!

267
01:09:36,606 --> 01:09:39,566
At least,
in Switzerland they won't starve!

268
01:11:05,205 --> 01:11:08,457
Such incredible stupidity
lugging those papers!

269
01:11:17,293 --> 01:11:20,831
Surviving is more important!
The devil with your suitcase!

270
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:22,715
Are you mad? My manuscript!

271
01:11:27,987 --> 01:11:31,990
Oh, I will take it...
it is too heavy for you.

272
01:11:44,105 --> 01:11:46,131
I can't go on... I can't.

273
01:11:46,439 --> 01:11:48,017
I have to rest a little.

274
01:11:54,431 --> 01:11:57,767
You go on and look after the child.

275
01:11:58,302 --> 01:11:59,886
Don't sit down.

276
01:12:24,473 --> 01:12:28,351
<i>Oh, Lord! Cast us not off
in our old age!</i>

277
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:31,829
<i>Forsake us not
when our strength faileth.</i>

278
01:13:37,940 --> 01:13:39,132
Where is your Uncle?

279
01:13:39,132 --> 01:13:40,300
I don't know!

280
01:16:38,214 --> 01:16:40,424
Bernard, don't be childish.

281
01:17:28,450 --> 01:17:32,572
Whenever we thought we were safe,
they appeared.

282
01:17:35,672 --> 01:17:37,516
But... we are used to walking.

283
01:17:37,516 --> 01:17:40,849
One emigration more or less
doesn't matter to us.

284
01:17:43,779 --> 01:17:47,365
But the child,
at least should have a little peace.

285
01:17:47,509 --> 01:17:50,803
Oh, God! If the Swiss only let us in!

286
01:17:51,971 --> 01:17:55,009
Don't worry... they will let you in
with the child.

287
01:17:55,009 --> 01:17:58,469
They are a friendly people...
they are like us Dutch.

288
01:19:36,399 --> 01:19:41,069
Losing your illusions
about the close ones was awful.

289
01:19:44,264 --> 01:19:48,935
Neighbors, friends...
even relatives betrayed you.

290
01:23:07,457 --> 01:23:10,892
<i>I bet there is wood for a fire
in that hut.</i>

291
01:23:10,892 --> 01:23:15,563
<i>No stopping. We must close
the border gap by five.</i>

292
01:24:52,815 --> 01:24:56,108
If only we hadn't made
this wretched stop...!

293
01:25:38,663 --> 01:25:40,239
Now we are finished!

294
01:25:41,281 --> 01:25:43,642
For this we have gone through
so much.

295
01:25:43,642 --> 01:25:48,206
For ten years we kept moving
just to die here!

296
01:25:52,067 --> 01:25:55,987
This is nothing to these soldiers.
Let's trust them.

297
01:25:56,571 --> 01:26:00,468
What more do you want.
We put them in danger.

298
01:28:33,343 --> 01:28:35,135
What is wrong with you?

299
01:28:37,022 --> 01:28:38,082
Nothing, Mother.

300
01:28:38,091 --> 01:28:40,750
You look strange, come, sit down.

301
01:28:42,002 --> 01:28:43,670
What are you thinking about?

302
01:28:45,973 --> 01:28:48,725
I have - I mean, they have a plan.

303
01:28:51,896 --> 01:28:54,898
Everything is going to be all right.

304
01:28:56,434 --> 01:28:59,728
Come, lie down...
you look awfully tired.

305
01:30:34,912 --> 01:30:36,397
Why are we stopping?

306
01:30:38,608 --> 01:30:40,642
The frontier can't be far.

307
01:31:20,593 --> 01:31:22,870
Where is my Bernard? Where is he?

308
01:31:22,970 --> 01:31:25,756
Up there, with the others.

309
01:31:48,412 --> 01:31:50,789
Bernard! He has gone mad.

310
01:35:12,683 --> 01:35:14,726
Halt! Switzerland!

311
01:35:58,956 --> 01:36:00,998
These people must have food.

312
01:36:04,987 --> 01:36:07,947
We can stay here Lieutenant,
can't we?

313
01:36:08,584 --> 01:36:11,870
For now, yes. I am powerless later.

314
01:36:18,893 --> 01:36:23,522
Only children and those over 65
can enter the country.

315
01:36:25,434 --> 01:36:29,645
They must return or prove
they're political refugees.

316
01:36:30,063 --> 01:36:33,065
But we can't be sent back!

317
01:36:33,376 --> 01:36:34,919
Don't worry now.

318
01:36:35,470 --> 01:36:40,156
I'm in touch with the authorities
and I'll do my best.

319
01:36:54,831 --> 01:36:59,042
The boy must undergo surgery.
Have you a truck here?

320
01:37:03,264 --> 01:37:04,973
Get the lorry.

321
01:38:00,465 --> 01:38:02,425
Get me Berne again.

322
01:39:11,373 --> 01:39:13,374
The lorry is here, Sir.

323
01:39:41,963 --> 01:39:43,881
Berne is on the wire, Sir!

324
01:39:48,570 --> 01:39:52,740
Yes... speaking.
Is the Chief still busy?

325
01:39:53,492 --> 01:39:56,785
I can't wait that long.
This is an emergency.

326
01:39:56,995 --> 01:40:00,289
The people must go
into the valley at once.

327
01:40:00,599 --> 01:40:03,935
Give me the authority to do
as I see fit.

328
01:41:10,844 --> 01:41:14,472
What? You give me full authority?
Good.

329
01:42:13,653 --> 01:42:15,987
We will do what we can, but...

330
01:42:25,065 --> 01:42:26,398
Is he asleep?

331
01:42:27,484 --> 01:42:29,151
Yes, he is asleep.

332
01:42:31,329 --> 01:42:34,790
And Uncle Hillel,
will they let him sleep, too?

333
01:42:34,842 --> 01:42:38,469
Yes, Hannele...
no one will disturb him anymore.

334
01:42:39,963 --> 01:42:41,297
And Bernard?

335
01:42:43,192 --> 01:42:47,028
Bernard is sleeping too...
deeply and soundly.

336
01:42:48,914 --> 01:42:51,082
Where are we going now?

337
01:42:52,802 --> 01:42:57,430
I don't know, Hannele.
There's nothing to fear now.

338
01:42:58,441 --> 01:43:00,776
We don't have to hide any longer.

339
01:44:39,430 --> 01:44:42,633
Poor boy... he is all alone now.

340
01:44:43,735 --> 01:44:46,354
And for us... life begins again.

341
01:44:48,572 --> 01:44:52,577
For myself, I know I must not give up
my work.

342
01:44:52,577 --> 01:44:56,890
It is true. All is lost except
these sheets of paper.

343
01:44:57,490 --> 01:45:00,842
But I now can say
what I intended to say.

344
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:08,750
No, Madame Monnier,
I shall not give up.

345
01:45:08,786 --> 01:45:13,000
I shall begin again...
We are <i>all</i> going to begin again.
