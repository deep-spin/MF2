1
00:01:45,978 --> 00:01:47,186
Oi! What's happened here?

2
00:02:09,894 --> 00:02:10,603
Sand.

3
00:02:11,228 --> 00:02:11,978
Sabotage.

4
00:02:12,269 --> 00:02:12,894
Wrecking.

5
00:02:13,561 --> 00:02:14,061
Deliberate.

6
00:02:14,561 --> 00:02:15,311
What's at the back of it?

7
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:16,103
Who did it?

8
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,894
I know how the law stands.

9
00:02:57,103 --> 00:02:59,644
You broke a contract, therefore
you broke the law.

10
00:03:01,561 --> 00:03:02,935
But it's everywhere - look at the street.

11
00:03:02,936 --> 00:03:04,537
I paid my money to look at the pictures.

12
00:03:04,603 --> 00:03:08,978
"Just a song at twilight."

13
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:14,853
If I want to sit in the dark
I can do it at 'ome.

14
00:03:14,936 --> 00:03:17,228
- Yes, free of charge.
- Yes.

15
00:03:18,061 --> 00:03:21,061
I think it's a blinkin' shame, robbing
the poor people like that.

16
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:23,519
We've got to have our money back.

17
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:26,978
It's an act of providence, like... an
earthquake, or a thunderbolt.

18
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:28,144
Or a baby.

19
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:30,353
Will you kindly not interfere?

20
00:03:30,394 --> 00:03:31,715
We've got to have our money back.

21
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:33,394
I'm so sorry I'm late, Mrs Verloc...

22
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,103
...but I had a hell of a time trying to eat
my egg on toast in the dark.

23
00:03:36,228 --> 00:03:38,102
Half of it's in my ear now!

24
00:03:38,103 --> 00:03:39,623
Nothing more or less than the Queen...

25
00:03:40,311 --> 00:03:42,478
They want their money back,
but we can't afford it.

26
00:03:43,353 --> 00:03:44,978
I do wish Mr Verloc would come.

27
00:05:30,436 --> 00:05:32,894
Rotten place, anyhow. Can't
even see the pictures.

28
00:05:33,144 --> 00:05:35,353
- They're getting nasty.
- Nasty? Hmph.

29
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:36,603
Leave 'em to me.

30
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:38,603
Hey, you.

31
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:39,810
What's all this about?

32
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:41,310
Lend me your flashlight, Jake.

33
00:05:41,311 --> 00:05:42,394
I want my money back.

34
00:05:42,644 --> 00:05:44,394
Is it our fault if the light fails?

35
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,845
Supposing you were a policeman
and got hit over the nut?

36
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:48,894
Do you think the government would
ask for their money back?

37
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:49,936
I paid for my seat.

38
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:52,144
Yes. And what about the one
you put your feet on?

39
00:06:09,853 --> 00:06:12,019
Carl! When did you get home?

40
00:06:12,269 --> 00:06:13,644
I haven't been out.

41
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:15,380
You weren't in twenty minutes ago.

42
00:06:15,644 --> 00:06:17,061
I came and called up the stairs.

43
00:06:17,228 --> 00:06:18,103
I was asleep.

44
00:06:18,894 --> 00:06:20,894
Why are you shining that torch on me?

45
00:06:21,228 --> 00:06:22,811
Can't you switch on the
light, or something?

46
00:06:22,894 --> 00:06:24,019
We can't - it's failed.

47
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:25,019
What?

48
00:06:25,061 --> 00:06:26,311
The fuse gone, then?

49
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:28,769
No, it's everywhere - in the
streets and the trams.

50
00:06:29,186 --> 00:06:31,186
And the audience downstairs
wants their money back.

51
00:06:31,228 --> 00:06:32,789
They're making a terrible row about it.

52
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:34,269
Well, give it back.

53
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,561
We... we can't possibly afford it.

54
00:06:37,686 --> 00:06:38,811
Oh, yes, we can.

55
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:40,311
You must be crazy.

56
00:06:40,603 --> 00:06:41,853
It'll clear us right out.

57
00:06:42,186 --> 00:06:43,978
You're always saying we don't
cover expenses.

58
00:06:44,936 --> 00:06:45,978
That's all right.

59
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:48,394
It doesn't pay to antagonise
the public.

60
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:50,061
I've got some money coming in.

61
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:51,228
Goon.

62
00:06:53,894 --> 00:06:55,603
Well, it's for you to say.

63
00:06:56,769 --> 00:06:58,811
If we're going to be generous,
let's do it properly.

64
00:06:59,228 --> 00:07:00,811
Come on downstairs and make
a speech about it.

65
00:07:00,894 --> 00:07:02,811
No, no. They're used to you.

66
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:04,019
You do it.

67
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:05,561
All right.

68
00:07:05,936 --> 00:07:07,144
I still think you're crazy.

69
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,769
It's an Act of God, I tell yer.

70
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:10,561
And what do you call an
Act of God?

71
00:07:10,686 --> 00:07:13,206
I call your face one, and you won't
get your money back on that.

72
00:07:14,103 --> 00:07:16,353
Now, if a plane were to come along
and drop a bomb on you...

73
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,436
...that would be an unfriendly act, within
the meaning of the Act.

74
00:07:19,728 --> 00:07:21,769
But if the juice dries up
of its own accord...

75
00:07:21,853 --> 00:07:23,353
...that's an Act of Providence.

76
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,478
As laid down in the Act of
William the Fourth.

77
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:29,060
Where an Act is defined
as "any activity"...

78
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:31,269
...“actuated by actual action."

79
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:33,186
No wonder the blinkin'
lights went down!

80
00:07:33,644 --> 00:07:34,811
It's a moot point.

81
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:37,144
I'll moot point 'em.
Make 'em pay!

82
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:38,478
- That's right, ma.
- Yes.

83
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:39,440
We want our money back.

84
00:07:39,644 --> 00:07:41,853
And how are you going to get it?
Apply sanctions?

85
00:07:42,103 --> 00:07:44,644
Are you familiar with the details
of the Covenant?

86
00:07:45,103 --> 00:07:47,394
If you'd studied Article 257...

87
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:49,019
...paragraph 24, line six...

88
00:07:49,144 --> 00:07:51,186
...Sanction B. It says, definitely, "no"!

89
00:07:51,353 --> 00:07:51,894
Oh.

90
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:53,894
Yes. You didn't know that, did you?

91
00:07:54,061 --> 00:07:55,144
You're all ignorant.

92
00:07:55,603 --> 00:07:58,268
Now, if you take my advice you'll go off
home, because there's nothing doing here.

93
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,311
Now, go on - get off.

94
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:01,436
What do you think you're doing?

95
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:02,936
Just lending a hand.

96
00:08:03,311 --> 00:08:04,644
I thought I told you not to interfere?

97
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:06,936
I've been delivering a little counter-attack.
Look, they're on the run.

98
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,269
Well they can come right back.

99
00:08:09,186 --> 00:08:11,786
Listen, ladies and gentlemen, you're
going to get your money back.

100
00:08:12,853 --> 00:08:14,686
Don't give in now - I'll stand by you.

101
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,853
I'd be afraid to go and stand
by your apple stall.

102
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:22,353
Ladies and gentlemen, I've been
speaking to Mr Verloc.

103
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:25,103
And since you're all regular patrons
and good friends...

104
00:08:25,644 --> 00:08:26,894
...he's going to let you have
your money back.

105
00:08:26,936 --> 00:08:29,144
There'll be no money back, I
tell you. Go on, get off.

106
00:08:29,978 --> 00:08:31,539
Please! Don't pay any attention to him!

107
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:33,603
I tell you, you're crazy!
I had it all fixed.

108
00:08:33,853 --> 00:08:35,133
Will you mind your own business?

109
00:08:35,144 --> 00:08:36,728
Of all the obstinate people...

110
00:08:36,769 --> 00:08:38,728
If you don't go away, I'll...
call the police.

111
00:08:44,061 --> 00:08:44,853
Renee.

112
00:08:45,061 --> 00:08:46,769
Start refunding the patrons
their money.

113
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:47,394
Oh!

114
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:51,353
Over here, Pat!

115
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:13,061
Oi! None of that. You 'aven't
been in before - 'op it!

116
00:09:15,186 --> 00:09:16,353
Thank you for your trouble.

117
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,644
I'm sure you meant well.

118
00:09:17,686 --> 00:09:19,353
Not at all. I like trouble.

119
00:09:37,353 --> 00:09:40,228
Left the conference
absolutely mortified!

120
00:09:44,978 --> 00:09:46,218
- How many?
- Two seats, please.

121
00:09:46,228 --> 00:09:48,228
Two? Right. Thank you.

122
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:50,728
- How many?
- Two shillings, please.

123
00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:51,728
Two shillings?

124
00:09:52,311 --> 00:09:52,811
Right.

125
00:09:53,728 --> 00:09:54,978
Wait for your change, please.

126
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,978
- How many?
- One.

127
00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:57,519
Thank you.

128
00:09:58,894 --> 00:09:59,436
How many?

129
00:09:59,561 --> 00:10:00,186
None, thanks.

130
00:10:00,228 --> 00:10:02,436
Oh, the vegetables is all ready
for dishing up.

131
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:04,228
Please tell Mrs Verloc, miss.

132
00:10:04,436 --> 00:10:06,353
Oh! There you are, ma'am.

133
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:10,394
I've got to hurry home now, 'cause me husband's
havin' trouble with his kidneys again.

134
00:10:10,603 --> 00:10:12,144
And I can't leave 'im for long.

135
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:13,935
Your young brother's lookin' after 'em.

136
00:10:13,936 --> 00:10:16,228
- What, the kidneys?
- No, the vegetables!

137
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:49,811
Oh, Stevie. Have you done
all this by yourself?

138
00:10:50,103 --> 00:10:51,811
Oh, come on. Don't be so modest.

139
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:06,186
Well...

140
00:11:06,353 --> 00:11:08,769
...we didn't have to pay them back
their money, after all.

141
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:11,019
Oh, Stevie! Sorry, sorry.

142
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:17,769
Always that woman, Mrs Jones, manages
to make the cabbage brown.

143
00:11:18,186 --> 00:11:20,394
I'm always telling her you
like things green.

144
00:11:20,728 --> 00:11:21,936
I'll make you a salad.

145
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:24,519
Stevie, run next door and get a
nice big head of lettuce.

146
00:11:24,561 --> 00:11:25,769
Long or round?

147
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,978
- I like long best.
- Whichever's freshest.

148
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,186
Tell them to charge it.

149
00:11:31,353 --> 00:11:34,353
We nearly wouldn't have been able to afford
lettuce if we'd payed them back.

150
00:11:37,186 --> 00:11:39,228
You didn't seem very interested
when I told you.

151
00:11:40,311 --> 00:11:40,936
I mean...

152
00:11:41,978 --> 00:11:43,858
...why were you so keen to pay
them back at all?

153
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:45,603
No, it's not that.

154
00:11:45,853 --> 00:11:47,811
Only... anything for quiet.

155
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:51,019
I don't like attention being
drawn to us like that.

156
00:11:52,728 --> 00:11:54,978
Good evening, Mrs Verloc. Forgive me for
butting in on your private affairs...

157
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,228
...but this prize specimen didn't appear
to know whether he wanted long, round...

158
00:11:57,269 --> 00:11:58,643
...square or oblong lettuce. So I
brought a selection.

159
00:11:58,644 --> 00:12:00,436
I distinctly said "long
ones" - you know I did.

160
00:12:00,478 --> 00:12:01,769
Did you? I thought you said "long ones".

161
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:03,103
I SAID "long ones"!

162
00:12:04,228 --> 00:12:05,394
Oh, good evening, Mr Verloc.

163
00:12:05,603 --> 00:12:07,311
So you came home just in time
to see the trouble, eh?

164
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:10,061
Me? I've been in all the afternoon.

165
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:12,061
But I could have sworn I saw you
come in, just about...

166
00:12:12,103 --> 00:12:13,186
Well, you were wrong.

167
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,311
I didn't know anything about it
until you woke me. Did I?

168
00:12:16,394 --> 00:12:17,019
No.

169
00:12:17,228 --> 00:12:19,186
He was lying down upstairs.
I had to call him.

170
00:12:19,394 --> 00:12:21,186
Sorry. My mistake, I suppose.

171
00:12:21,936 --> 00:12:23,436
Well, here we are.

172
00:12:29,894 --> 00:12:31,436
I thought someone was
committing a murder!

173
00:12:31,478 --> 00:12:32,936
Someone probably is.

174
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:34,186
From the scream there.

175
00:12:34,228 --> 00:12:36,436
Stevie, hop on a chair and
fix that fan light.

176
00:12:36,894 --> 00:12:38,735
Look out George Arliss doesn't
bite you, Steve!

177
00:12:38,978 --> 00:12:40,228
Well, good night all.

178
00:12:57,061 --> 00:12:59,141
All right, lady. I'll look round
the market tomorrow.

179
00:12:59,228 --> 00:12:59,936
Thank you.

180
00:13:00,394 --> 00:13:01,936
Do you mind if I knock off
early tonight, guv?

181
00:13:02,144 --> 00:13:03,436
- Okay, Ted.
- Thank you.

182
00:13:14,936 --> 00:13:15,936
Good night, boys.

183
00:13:19,228 --> 00:13:21,269
That feller seems to knock
off whenever he likes.

184
00:13:45,103 --> 00:13:47,019
All right. We'll put someone onto that.

185
00:13:53,353 --> 00:13:54,811
Well, Sergeant - you saw what
happened tonight.

186
00:13:54,936 --> 00:13:56,228
- Yes, sir.
- Anything your end?

187
00:13:56,728 --> 00:13:59,478
I'm not certain, but I could have sworn I saw
Verloc come back in the middle of it all.

188
00:14:00,103 --> 00:14:02,103
Later, when I challenged him, he said
he'd never been out at all.

189
00:14:02,311 --> 00:14:03,143
His wife confirmed it.

190
00:14:03,144 --> 00:14:05,144
Naturally. She would if she's in it.

191
00:14:05,811 --> 00:14:07,571
You'd better find some way
of talking to her.

192
00:14:08,186 --> 00:14:10,436
Now, listen, Spencer. The Home Office
have been on...

193
00:14:10,644 --> 00:14:12,894
...and they're scared something worse than
tonight's job may happen.

194
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:15,019
What's the idea, sir? What's the
point of all this wrecking?

195
00:14:15,144 --> 00:14:17,825
Making trouble at home to take our minds
off what's going on abroad.

196
00:14:18,269 --> 00:14:20,603
Same as in a crowd. One man
treads on your toe...

197
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:22,603
...and while you're arguing with him,
his pal picks your pocket.

198
00:14:22,686 --> 00:14:23,519
Who's behind it?

199
00:14:23,644 --> 00:14:25,805
Ah, they're the people that you
and I will never catch.

200
00:14:26,061 --> 00:14:28,186
It's the men they employ
that we're after.

201
00:14:42,228 --> 00:14:43,708
Don't you know that's very dangerous?

202
00:14:43,936 --> 00:14:44,311
What?

203
00:14:44,394 --> 00:14:45,834
Leaving stuff like that lying about.

204
00:14:45,853 --> 00:14:47,561
Supposing you or me was to
break our leg on that.

205
00:14:47,728 --> 00:14:49,394
You'd be very pleased with
yourself, I suppose.

206
00:14:49,436 --> 00:14:51,396
That would depend whether
it was your leg or mine.

207
00:14:51,478 --> 00:14:54,728
Can't tempt you, I suppose? Oranges,
very nice today. Good for the feet.

208
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:01,422
Hello, guv. Going to the pictures?

209
00:15:02,853 --> 00:15:04,728
As a matter of fact I'm off
to a trade show.

210
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:06,853
Well, pick us a good one, then. You
know - plenty of murders.

211
00:15:07,061 --> 00:15:08,519
This love stuff makes me sick.

212
00:15:08,978 --> 00:15:10,519
The women like it, though.

213
00:15:15,311 --> 00:15:16,102
He's just going.

214
00:15:16,103 --> 00:15:18,784
Oh, then tell him not to come back too
late, 'cause we're going out.

215
00:15:21,061 --> 00:15:23,686
I'm told to tell you not to come back too
late because we're both going out.

216
00:15:23,728 --> 00:15:25,478
I'll be back as soon as I can.

217
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:39,103
A penny each pineapple.
Pineapples a penny each.

218
00:15:39,228 --> 00:15:41,686
A penny each pineapple.
Pineapples a penny each.

219
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:44,936
A penny each pineapple.
Pineapples a penny each.

220
00:16:20,186 --> 00:16:20,936
Robbie, come here!

221
00:16:31,269 --> 00:16:33,936
What's them bubbles, Dad?
Has the fish got 'iccups?

222
00:16:34,103 --> 00:16:36,853
You'd have 'iccups if you had
to live on ants' eggs.

223
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:46,103
- They're funny looking things.
- Yes.

224
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:47,853
They're funny looking things.

225
00:16:48,478 --> 00:16:51,769
It'll take three like that to make soup for
the Lord Mayor's banquet next Saturday.

226
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:53,103
Think of that.

227
00:16:53,561 --> 00:16:55,103
They say it's digestible, though.

228
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,228
Hmph. There's a thing with a moustache.

229
00:17:06,311 --> 00:17:08,603
I hope you're satisfied with
last night's show.

230
00:17:09,436 --> 00:17:10,936
It wasn't as easy as it looked.

231
00:17:11,478 --> 00:17:12,936
I had to spend money, too.

232
00:17:13,394 --> 00:17:14,019
No doubt.

233
00:17:14,478 --> 00:17:15,561
A neat job, though.

234
00:17:15,853 --> 00:17:17,561
The sort of thing to make people sit up.

235
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:20,909
I think you'll agree I've
earned my money?

236
00:17:23,478 --> 00:17:26,103
I hope you didn't mind my asking
for it in pound notes?

237
00:17:29,311 --> 00:17:30,728
You made London laugh.

238
00:17:32,228 --> 00:17:34,061
When one sets out to put the
fear of death into people...

239
00:17:34,103 --> 00:17:35,664
...it's not helpful to make them laugh.

240
00:17:36,228 --> 00:17:37,519
We're not comedians.

241
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:40,019
It's not my fault if they are such fools.

242
00:17:40,228 --> 00:17:42,019
Londoners are not fools.

243
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:45,186
They laughed because they realised what
happened last night was laughable.

244
00:17:45,894 --> 00:17:46,934
They did right to laugh...

245
00:17:47,103 --> 00:17:47,894
...this time.

246
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:50,186
What do you mean?

247
00:17:51,728 --> 00:17:52,686
Mr Verloc.

248
00:17:53,936 --> 00:17:55,978
You will be paid your money
when you've earned it.

249
00:17:57,603 --> 00:17:58,436
I don't follow.

250
00:18:00,186 --> 00:18:01,436
My dear Verloc.

251
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:06,519
I once read a sign in Piccadilly Circus,
calling it the centre of the world.

252
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,436
I think you'd better pay a visit there,
in a couple of days' time.

253
00:18:10,728 --> 00:18:14,103
Leave a small parcel in the cloakroom
at the Underground station.

254
00:18:14,853 --> 00:18:16,311
What sort of a parcel?

255
00:18:17,019 --> 00:18:17,853
Oh, I don't know.

256
00:18:18,894 --> 00:18:21,436
Let's say... a parcel of fireworks.

257
00:18:25,644 --> 00:18:26,519
I couldn't do it.

258
00:18:29,353 --> 00:18:32,561
I'm not going to be connected with
anything that means loss of life.

259
00:18:33,394 --> 00:18:34,715
You'll have to get somebody else.

260
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:36,978
I won't touch it.

261
00:18:37,311 --> 00:18:38,519
Very well, then, Mr Verloc.

262
00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:40,644
If you think you're so well-off that...

263
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:41,409
You know I'm not.

264
00:18:42,478 --> 00:18:43,394
You know my position.

265
00:18:43,811 --> 00:18:44,686
All right, then.

266
00:18:45,269 --> 00:18:47,061
You'll be payed your money when...

267
00:18:48,936 --> 00:18:51,269
In any case, if you're so fussy
about doing it yourself...

268
00:18:52,228 --> 00:18:54,603
...surely you have some kind friends
who would help you?

269
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:57,190
Now, don't be so silly.

270
00:19:00,853 --> 00:19:02,019
Go and see this man.

271
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:09,436
He's a very nice old gentleman, and he
makes lovely fireworks.

272
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:14,686
I'll try and see him.

273
00:19:16,728 --> 00:19:18,019
And don't forget the date.

274
00:19:19,311 --> 00:19:20,269
Saturday next.

275
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:22,269
Lord Mayor's Show day,

276
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:24,269
Lots of people.

277
00:19:25,436 --> 00:19:26,894
Do you want me to come and report?

278
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:29,478
Thanks, no.

279
00:19:30,478 --> 00:19:32,936
If your report itself is...
loud enough...

280
00:19:33,603 --> 00:19:34,603
...it won't be necessary.

281
00:19:37,394 --> 00:19:39,394
Which is the way out, please?

282
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:41,811
Thank you.

283
00:19:45,103 --> 00:19:48,103
This bivalve's rate of fertility
is extremely high.

284
00:19:48,436 --> 00:19:51,311
After laying a million eggs the female
oyster changes her sex.

285
00:19:51,353 --> 00:19:53,311
Hmph! I don't blame her!

286
00:20:39,728 --> 00:20:41,269
Excuse me, can I help you?

287
00:20:41,311 --> 00:20:43,269
Oh, urn, thank you.

288
00:20:53,728 --> 00:20:55,686
Cor, its feet are cold!

289
00:20:59,144 --> 00:21:00,186
Isn't it fat?

290
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:03,728
You'd be fat too if you were fed corn,
and bits of bread all day long.

291
00:21:03,894 --> 00:21:05,455
Why, if it isn't Stevie and Mrs Verloc.

292
00:21:05,478 --> 00:21:06,977
Ooh, it's Ted. Look, Ted!

293
00:21:06,978 --> 00:21:08,186
Yes, it always is.

294
00:21:08,311 --> 00:21:10,186
Fat, isn't it? Ought to
eat more fruit, eh?

295
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,978
You and your fruit, that's
our lunch today.

296
00:21:13,186 --> 00:21:15,561
Why, is that all? How about a nice juicy
steak with me? What about it?

297
00:21:15,686 --> 00:21:16,436
I'm all for it.

298
00:21:16,603 --> 00:21:16,894
Stevie.

299
00:21:16,936 --> 00:21:17,896
Good, where shall we go?

300
00:21:17,936 --> 00:21:19,394
I'd like to go to Simpson's.

301
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,644
Boy I know's uncle took him there once.

302
00:21:21,728 --> 00:21:24,436
Don't be silly, Stevie. We're going to the
Corner House or a tea shop.

303
00:21:24,478 --> 00:21:26,598
Oh, don't be too hard, Mrs V.
Let's make it Simpson's.

304
00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:31,144
Come on.

305
00:21:40,436 --> 00:21:41,769
Have you ever been here before?

306
00:21:41,894 --> 00:21:42,769
No, never.

307
00:21:54,103 --> 00:21:56,543
Oh, Stevie - look what you're doing!
You're pulling the table.

308
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:02,769
I saw a picture once, where a chap snatched
the tablecloth off the table...

309
00:22:02,936 --> 00:22:04,456
...and left everything standing on it.

310
00:22:04,478 --> 00:22:05,728
You ought to try that at home one day.

311
00:22:05,894 --> 00:22:06,478
He did.

312
00:22:08,144 --> 00:22:09,644
All this is very expensive, isn't it?

313
00:22:10,936 --> 00:22:12,297
Yes. It looks like it, doesn't it?

314
00:22:16,019 --> 00:22:17,644
I've got a pound note, if you want it?

315
00:22:18,186 --> 00:22:19,186
It's all right.

316
00:22:20,936 --> 00:22:22,894
Now. Steve. Setting aside the
steak for a moment...

317
00:22:22,936 --> 00:22:25,269
...we have here before us
oysters, caviar...

318
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:28,186
...smoked salmon, fried, grilled
or boiled sole.

319
00:22:28,228 --> 00:22:28,810
I'll have a...

320
00:22:28,811 --> 00:22:31,228
Roast saddle of mutton, Kentish
chicken pudding...

321
00:22:31,311 --> 00:22:33,228
...boiled silverside, roast sirloin...

322
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,686
...chops, steaks, grilled kidneys
or roast duck.

323
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:37,894
I think Stevie'd like a nice
poached egg on toast.

324
00:22:37,936 --> 00:22:39,894
And I'll have a mixed salad.

325
00:22:41,478 --> 00:22:42,394
Here, drink this.

326
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:44,103
Poached egg? Here at Simpson's?

327
00:22:44,144 --> 00:22:46,504
Why, that's enough to make the
roast beef turn in its gravy!

328
00:22:46,561 --> 00:22:46,978
Oh.

329
00:22:47,061 --> 00:22:49,228
Three bullocks roasted whole,
and a cup of coffee.

330
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:51,811
Sirloins at number eight.

331
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:53,978
When did you come over
from America?

332
00:22:54,186 --> 00:22:55,103
About a year ago.

333
00:22:55,644 --> 00:22:57,228
Business wasn't too good over there.

334
00:22:57,394 --> 00:22:58,061
That's funny.

335
00:22:58,436 --> 00:23:01,394
People used to go over to the States because
business wasn't too good over here.

336
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:03,144
How are things working out now?
Not too good, hmm?

337
00:23:03,353 --> 00:23:04,353
Not terribly.

338
00:23:04,894 --> 00:23:06,894
I thought I hadn't noticed you
turning people away.

339
00:23:07,436 --> 00:23:09,519
It's hard to make a one-man
business pay these days.

340
00:23:09,811 --> 00:23:11,228
Unless you run a sideline.

341
00:23:12,728 --> 00:23:14,228
Has Mr Verloc a sideline?

342
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:17,728
No, but we're quite satisfied
with things as they are.

343
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:19,728
Just one happy little family?

344
00:23:24,978 --> 00:23:27,061
Just one happy little family.

345
00:23:29,311 --> 00:23:31,478
Mr Verloc's very kind to Stevie.

346
00:23:31,894 --> 00:23:33,561
And that means a lot
to Stevie's sister?

347
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:35,320
It means everything.

348
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,644
Now, here we are.

349
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:38,728
Good morning, sir.

350
00:23:39,894 --> 00:23:41,394
No fat for you, as usual?

351
00:23:41,728 --> 00:23:42,849
You see I don't forget, sir.

352
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:44,561
Haven't seen you for a long time.

353
00:23:46,103 --> 00:23:47,269
Do I look as though I don't like fat?

354
00:23:47,436 --> 00:23:48,478
What's the big idea?

355
00:23:48,853 --> 00:23:49,394
What idea?

356
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,481
First, pretending never to have
been here before.

357
00:23:51,603 --> 00:23:53,686
Second, affording to come
here on your salary.

358
00:23:53,811 --> 00:23:56,492
That's what everyone would like to know.
There's a mystery about me!

359
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,103
Come to think of it, there's a mystery
about most people.

360
00:23:59,186 --> 00:24:00,853
Haven't you got some
terrible secret?

361
00:24:01,061 --> 00:24:02,103
Never mind about that!

362
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:04,436
What goes on after hours in
that cinema of yours?

363
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:05,644
Deeds of darkness!

364
00:24:05,936 --> 00:24:08,019
Does your husband go on
mysterious journeys?

365
00:24:08,061 --> 00:24:10,018
He does - wearing false whiskers.

366
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:12,059
Ah-ha! That means there's another
woman in his life.

367
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,269
What's the joke?

368
00:24:13,811 --> 00:24:14,894
If you only knew him.

369
00:24:15,478 --> 00:24:19,103
He's the quietest, most harmless,
home-loving person.

370
00:24:52,853 --> 00:24:54,936
Well? What luck with Mrs Verloc?

371
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:57,061
She knows nothing, sir.
Nothing at all.

372
00:24:57,103 --> 00:24:57,811
What makes you think so?

373
00:24:57,936 --> 00:25:00,336
She has a straight answer to everything.
Besides, her manner.

374
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:01,269
Pretty woman?

375
00:25:03,186 --> 00:25:04,936
- What's that got to do with it, sir'?
- Ah, I know.

376
00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:06,394
I'm too tender-hearted myself.

377
00:25:06,603 --> 00:25:08,144
Especially where women are concerned.

378
00:25:08,394 --> 00:25:09,186
What about Verloc?

379
00:25:09,561 --> 00:25:10,103
I'm not certain.

380
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:12,185
But if he is mixed up in this he's
not giving himself away.

381
00:25:12,186 --> 00:25:13,561
I'm not so sure about that.

382
00:25:13,853 --> 00:25:15,644
- Your assistant... er... what's his name?
- Hollingshead.

383
00:25:15,853 --> 00:25:18,393
Hollingshead was signalled by you this
morning to follow this man.

384
00:25:18,394 --> 00:25:18,894
Yes, sir.

385
00:25:19,103 --> 00:25:20,944
Well, er... just reach me
that paper, will you?

386
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:25,103
This is his report. Telephoned from
a call box, ten minutes ago.

387
00:25:25,603 --> 00:25:27,228
"Verloc went to the zoo aquarium."

388
00:25:27,353 --> 00:25:28,519
"Evidently by appointment."

389
00:25:29,186 --> 00:25:32,644
"And met a certain foreign individual,
who handed him a paper."

390
00:25:33,186 --> 00:25:35,978
"He then proceeded to go to 65
Liverpool Road, Islington."

391
00:25:36,103 --> 00:25:37,061
"Which is a bird shop."

392
00:25:37,436 --> 00:25:39,769
"I'm waiting for him to come out, and
will report again later on."

393
00:25:39,978 --> 00:25:41,186
- Islington?
- Exactly.

394
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:42,799
Doesn't mean much to me, either.

395
00:26:03,811 --> 00:26:05,269
But I can't understand, madam.

396
00:26:05,311 --> 00:26:06,936
One of my best songbirds.

397
00:26:07,061 --> 00:26:09,019
It sang all day before you
purchased it.

398
00:26:09,228 --> 00:26:11,394
Perhaps in a few days
it will settle down.

399
00:26:11,478 --> 00:26:13,728
Nothing won't make it settle
down. I've tried all ways.

400
00:26:13,769 --> 00:26:14,561
Whistling to it...

401
00:26:14,728 --> 00:26:15,519
...clapping me 'ands...

402
00:26:15,561 --> 00:26:16,686
...frying bacon. No use.

403
00:26:16,728 --> 00:26:18,936
It just sits there and makes
me look silly.

404
00:26:19,061 --> 00:26:21,144
Not the bird's fault, I assure
you, madam.

405
00:26:21,269 --> 00:26:21,978
Isn't it?

406
00:26:22,311 --> 00:26:23,853
I'll have my two-and-nine, please.

407
00:26:23,936 --> 00:26:25,144
And there's yer bird back.

408
00:26:25,394 --> 00:26:26,894
I want a canary for company.

409
00:26:27,144 --> 00:26:28,894
Perhaps I can make him sing?

410
00:26:34,061 --> 00:26:35,394
There, now.

411
00:26:35,853 --> 00:26:36,936
You sure it was 'im?

412
00:26:37,103 --> 00:26:38,228
Listen again.

413
00:26:41,144 --> 00:26:42,394
I see his beak open.

414
00:26:42,478 --> 00:26:43,811
Of course you did.

415
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:44,853
There's a good boy.

416
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:47,811
Now, don't forget - plenty of watercress
and you must whistle to him.

417
00:26:47,894 --> 00:26:48,644
Me, whistle?

418
00:26:48,769 --> 00:26:51,436
Perhaps you'd like me to sit in the cage,
and him do the housework?

419
00:26:54,061 --> 00:26:57,561
Yes, of course. You want something from
my other department, don't you?

420
00:26:57,811 --> 00:26:59,561
Mmm hmm? This way.

421
00:27:10,686 --> 00:27:11,936
My daughter.

422
00:27:18,853 --> 00:27:21,228
Much better than having
strangers doing for you.

423
00:27:21,394 --> 00:27:23,853
Strangers... too inquisitive,
you know?

424
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:26,103
Now, where are my keys?

425
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,144
Tut, tut, tut, tut.

426
00:27:28,353 --> 00:27:30,144
How very careless.

427
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:32,853
She oughtn't to let the child
play up here.

428
00:27:33,228 --> 00:27:34,436
Very dangerous.

429
00:27:34,811 --> 00:27:37,061
There you are... no father,
no discipline.

430
00:27:37,186 --> 00:27:38,311
What can you expect?

431
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:40,311
Is the little girl's father dead?

432
00:27:40,936 --> 00:27:42,144
I don't know.

433
00:27:43,186 --> 00:27:44,311
He might be. Heh.

434
00:27:44,686 --> 00:27:46,728
I don't know. Nobody knows.

435
00:27:47,644 --> 00:27:49,519
My daughter would like
to know, too.

436
00:27:50,103 --> 00:27:51,228
But there you are.

437
00:27:51,686 --> 00:27:53,936
It's her cross, and she
must bear it.

438
00:27:54,436 --> 00:27:56,186
We all have our cross to bear.

439
00:27:56,603 --> 00:27:57,311
Mmm hmm?

440
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:02,228
Everything there looks pretty harmless.

441
00:28:02,478 --> 00:28:03,811
You are right, my friend.

442
00:28:04,311 --> 00:28:04,811
But...

443
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:06,228
...if I were to mix, say...

444
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:07,978
...a little tomato sauce...

445
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,436
...with some strawberry jam.

446
00:28:10,853 --> 00:28:11,936
Then...

447
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:17,436
I gather from our mutual friend...

448
00:28:17,978 --> 00:28:20,936
That Saturday is the day. And the
hour, 1:45.

449
00:28:21,478 --> 00:28:23,519
But, how do I start the mechanism?

450
00:28:23,603 --> 00:28:25,228
Oh, you leave that to me.

451
00:28:25,686 --> 00:28:28,853
By the time you receive it, everything
will have been set in motion.

452
00:28:30,603 --> 00:28:32,083
- Uh huh.
- You seem a little nervous.

453
00:28:32,103 --> 00:28:32,603
Mmm.

454
00:28:32,936 --> 00:28:33,769
Don't be afraid.

455
00:28:34,103 --> 00:28:37,561
Say to yourself "there is one
man who envies you".

456
00:28:38,394 --> 00:28:39,353
Envies me?

457
00:28:40,603 --> 00:28:42,728
I've been a fighter always, until now.

458
00:28:42,936 --> 00:28:46,394
But alas, I'm no longer wanted
in the front line.

459
00:28:46,603 --> 00:28:48,686
I must keep the fighters... supplied.

460
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,644
- But I would rather be in your shoes.
- Hm.

461
00:28:58,644 --> 00:28:59,894
My dear!

462
00:29:00,186 --> 00:29:01,894
Just look here.

463
00:29:03,311 --> 00:29:05,061
Yes, yes. Perhaps you're right.

464
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:07,478
I must have put it there myself.

465
00:29:11,103 --> 00:29:11,603
Oh.

466
00:29:12,894 --> 00:29:15,311
There, there. No harm done.

467
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:19,311
Well, I...

468
00:29:19,478 --> 00:29:21,311
...think everything is quite clear.

469
00:29:23,894 --> 00:29:26,644
Slap me hard! Grandads
been very naughty.

470
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,561
Look there! What's he doing?

471
00:29:33,978 --> 00:29:36,144
He might be watching me.
Why not?

472
00:29:36,436 --> 00:29:38,144
They probably know too much already.

473
00:29:38,478 --> 00:29:39,561
They'll raid you one day.

474
00:29:40,811 --> 00:29:44,144
I shall give them a nice warm
welcome, if they do.

475
00:29:45,228 --> 00:29:46,228
He didn't see me.

476
00:29:48,353 --> 00:29:50,019
On Saturday - without fail, sir.

477
00:29:50,353 --> 00:29:53,436
Two canaries in a nice cage,
with a very deep tray.

478
00:29:53,644 --> 00:29:56,936
Don't forget, Saturday at 1:45.
Good day, sir.

479
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:58,394
Good day.

480
00:30:02,436 --> 00:30:04,061
That child again.

481
00:30:05,353 --> 00:30:06,394
And now, sir.

482
00:30:06,644 --> 00:30:09,353
I want a nice singing canary.

483
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:16,478
A canary. You say it and my dear little
birds, at once, answer for themselves.

484
00:30:20,353 --> 00:30:23,519
Of course, I realise he wasn't really a
greengrocer's assistant at all.

485
00:30:23,728 --> 00:30:27,394
I mean, a greengrocer's assistant can hardly
afford to lunch at Simpson's, can he?

486
00:30:27,686 --> 00:30:28,978
He's really quite well off.

487
00:30:29,228 --> 00:30:30,708
And he's there to learn the business.

488
00:30:30,811 --> 00:30:32,478
It's one of a big chain, that shop.

489
00:30:33,103 --> 00:30:36,394
If you ask me, I believe he's the son
of the man who owns them.

490
00:30:36,853 --> 00:30:38,728
How'd you like a job
selling fruit, Stevie?

491
00:30:38,894 --> 00:30:40,061
I wouldn't mind with Ted.

492
00:30:40,269 --> 00:30:41,811
He makes it all sound fun.

493
00:30:42,394 --> 00:30:44,728
Wouldn't it be grand to have steak
whenever you like?

494
00:30:45,019 --> 00:30:46,728
Crumbs, I'd have it three times a day!

495
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,019
You'd soon get sick of it.

496
00:30:48,103 --> 00:30:50,894
Bet I wouldn't. I don't see how you could
get sick of things to eat.

497
00:30:51,144 --> 00:30:52,186
'Cept poached eggs.

498
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:53,728
What's the matter with
poached eggs?

499
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,728
I think they're the worst
things in the world.

500
00:30:55,811 --> 00:30:57,144
I bet Ted doesn't eat them.

501
00:30:57,311 --> 00:30:58,186
I'm sure he does.

502
00:30:58,478 --> 00:31:00,279
I bet he doesn't, they're
beneath his dignity.

503
00:31:00,603 --> 00:31:02,811
I don't think Ted's so
terribly dignified.

504
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,436
Well, he's too dignified
to eat eggs.

505
00:31:04,644 --> 00:31:05,852
Hey, now! See - you're bunching it up!

506
00:31:05,853 --> 00:31:07,644
Oh, now! It's all right, Stevie.

507
00:31:08,061 --> 00:31:09,821
Do you think Ted'll come
with us and sail it?

508
00:31:09,853 --> 00:31:11,103
He might if you ask him.

509
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,103
He's more likely to if you ask him.

510
00:31:14,686 --> 00:31:15,853
Sailing boats is fun.

511
00:31:16,061 --> 00:31:16,769
I like it.

512
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:18,853
But Ted knows about
all sorts of things.

513
00:31:18,936 --> 00:31:20,853
Gangsters and burglars
and everything.

514
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:22,978
- How does he know?
- He reads about 'em.

515
00:31:23,144 --> 00:31:25,686
He says gangsters are not nearly so
frightening as you'd think.

516
00:31:25,936 --> 00:31:27,497
Some of them are quite
ordinary looking.

517
00:31:27,603 --> 00:31:29,686
Like you and me and Mr Verloc.

518
00:31:30,103 --> 00:31:31,103
Perhaps he's right.

519
00:31:31,436 --> 00:31:33,603
After all, if gangsters looked
like gangsters...

520
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:36,004
the police would soon get after them,
wouldn't they, I mean?

521
00:31:43,853 --> 00:31:44,936
Sixpence, please.

522
00:31:46,353 --> 00:31:46,936
Thank you.

523
00:31:49,061 --> 00:31:50,561
Is Mr Verloc in?

524
00:31:50,811 --> 00:31:52,561
- Was he expecting you?
- Yes.

525
00:31:52,936 --> 00:31:55,061
- Do you know your way through?
- Yes, I think so.

526
00:31:55,228 --> 00:31:57,561
- Pass one, Jack.
- Thank you.

527
00:32:05,644 --> 00:32:07,561
I have an appointment with Mr Verloc.

528
00:32:07,853 --> 00:32:09,144
- Do you know your way through?
- No.

529
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:10,603
You go right through the theatre.

530
00:32:10,894 --> 00:32:12,603
- Pass one, Jack.
- Thank you.

531
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:17,019
Apples a pound there!

532
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:18,519
Lady there, Ted.

533
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,728
Yes, madam. What can I do for you?

534
00:32:19,936 --> 00:32:21,728
Pound of those apples, please.

535
00:32:22,144 --> 00:32:23,728
I have to slip away in a minute.

536
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:27,728
Maybe I won't be bothering you any
more again after tonight.

537
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:32,894
Thank you.

538
00:32:48,144 --> 00:32:49,384
Keep an eye out, Jim, will you?

539
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:54,061
One balcony, please.

540
00:32:54,269 --> 00:32:55,686
Pass one, Jack.

541
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,144
"I'm glad you found this."

542
00:33:02,353 --> 00:33:04,769
"It's the most important of the lot.
I'll burn it, too."

543
00:33:04,853 --> 00:33:06,436
"Oh, huh, allow me."

544
00:33:06,686 --> 00:33:07,769
"Oh, thank you."

545
00:33:10,353 --> 00:33:13,061
"Well - all our troubles are over now."

546
00:33:15,853 --> 00:33:16,353
"Oh!"

547
00:33:25,644 --> 00:33:27,519
"Ch! Oh! Oh!"

548
00:33:28,061 --> 00:33:29,519
- "What's that?"
- "What's what?"

549
00:33:38,144 --> 00:33:38,935
"Look out!"

550
00:33:38,936 --> 00:33:41,186
"Ah-Ooh! Ah-ooh!"

551
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:42,686
"Hold the phone!"

552
00:33:43,644 --> 00:33:44,894
"Come on, Sidney."

553
00:33:45,978 --> 00:33:47,102
Hello, Ted. Where are you going?

554
00:33:47,103 --> 00:33:48,353
Just going to have a word
with Mr Verloc.

555
00:33:48,394 --> 00:33:50,103
Oh, he doesn't talk through
loudspeakers.

556
00:33:50,144 --> 00:33:50,686
Is that what's in there?

557
00:33:50,936 --> 00:33:52,811
Oh, it's only the screen - not
much to look at.

558
00:33:57,061 --> 00:33:59,853
<i>“Oh, Oh?</i>

559
00:34:00,144 --> 00:34:01,769
Where does that lead to?

560
00:34:02,478 --> 00:34:05,228
To our front room. You
remember, when it fell open?

561
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,853
I'll give old Mr V a surprise!

562
00:34:07,936 --> 00:34:10,978
- "It's the door!"
- "Come out of that."

563
00:34:11,894 --> 00:34:13,061
"I'm your nephew."

564
00:34:13,228 --> 00:34:14,061
"Oh, are you?"

565
00:34:17,353 --> 00:34:21,436
"Oh, don't fiddle about, that's no good.
Leave it to me, I'll get it out of him."

566
00:34:26,186 --> 00:34:27,603
"Don't you do that to me!"

567
00:34:27,728 --> 00:34:29,603
"Well, don't you talk like that to me."

568
00:34:29,894 --> 00:34:31,311
"Remember, I'm yer uncle..."

569
00:34:31,394 --> 00:34:32,644
Not at all.

570
00:34:33,186 --> 00:34:36,478
I'm only too glad to pay what
the job's worth.

571
00:34:36,686 --> 00:34:39,394
Well, I don't see anything against it.

572
00:34:39,728 --> 00:34:42,436
I'll call in tomorrow, about
eleven o'clock.

573
00:34:43,269 --> 00:34:44,853
And afterward...

574
00:34:45,686 --> 00:34:47,353
I'll settle with you...

575
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:49,353
...when you've done the job.

576
00:34:51,853 --> 00:34:52,894
Of course...

577
00:34:53,061 --> 00:34:57,686
...if the Arsenal lose to Birmingham on
Saturday, I shan't be so pleased.

578
00:34:57,978 --> 00:34:58,811
Arsenal?

579
00:34:59,561 --> 00:35:00,394
I don't follow.

580
00:35:00,561 --> 00:35:03,893
No, no, I know you don't follow Arsenal,
but they're a good bet.

581
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:08,978
Believe me. Don't forget, I... filled
in about ten coupons.

582
00:35:09,603 --> 00:35:11,978
Stands me in at about
fifteen bob!

583
00:35:12,186 --> 00:35:13,353
So I'd better...

584
00:35:17,561 --> 00:35:19,061
Why... I know him!

585
00:35:19,394 --> 00:35:20,353
What were you doing up there?

586
00:35:20,394 --> 00:35:21,019
Who is he?

587
00:35:21,228 --> 00:35:22,478
Well, he's from from the
fruiterer next door.

588
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:23,269
I know him, all right, but...

589
00:35:23,394 --> 00:35:24,269
What happened?

590
00:35:24,603 --> 00:35:27,436
I was showing Ted the back of the
screen and the loudspeakers.

591
00:35:28,103 --> 00:35:29,436
Wasn't that all right?

592
00:35:30,228 --> 00:35:31,603
Hope I didn't hurt you?

593
00:35:31,644 --> 00:35:32,936
You never know, you know?

594
00:35:33,061 --> 00:35:35,603
Well, Mr Verloc... no harm
done, I hope!

595
00:35:36,394 --> 00:35:38,811
I must be getting back to the shade
of the old apple tree.

596
00:35:39,394 --> 00:35:39,894
Sorry.

597
00:35:44,103 --> 00:35:44,894
Good night, all.

598
00:35:45,353 --> 00:35:46,103
Good night.

599
00:35:47,811 --> 00:35:51,561
That is Detective Sergeant Spencer
of Scotland Yard.

600
00:35:53,144 --> 00:35:54,103
But who's he after?

601
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:55,061
You're having us on?

602
00:35:55,103 --> 00:35:56,353
But what are we going to
do about it?

603
00:35:56,478 --> 00:35:58,918
But he's connected with the fruit
store next door, I tell you!

604
00:35:58,978 --> 00:36:01,538
Spencer got me my last stretch - the
one I'm on licence from now.

605
00:36:01,811 --> 00:36:02,519
What are we going to do about it?

606
00:36:02,603 --> 00:36:03,186
One thing.

607
00:36:03,353 --> 00:36:05,186
This job is off, out, finished.

608
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:06,811
We go quick from here, and scatter.

609
00:36:06,853 --> 00:36:07,686
And keep scattered.

610
00:36:07,978 --> 00:36:09,853
And if he comes here again, tell him you
don't know where we live.

611
00:36:10,311 --> 00:36:11,978
Say we've gone abroad -
anything you like!

612
00:36:47,644 --> 00:36:49,811
Yesterday - at Simpson's...

613
00:36:50,311 --> 00:36:51,831
...when you had lunch with
that fellow.

614
00:36:52,103 --> 00:36:53,269
With Ted, you mean?

615
00:36:53,894 --> 00:36:55,353
Remember what he said to you.

616
00:36:56,144 --> 00:36:58,394
Did he ask you any questions
about yourself?

617
00:36:58,769 --> 00:36:59,561
About me?

618
00:37:00,186 --> 00:37:02,061
None that I can think of. Why?

619
00:37:02,561 --> 00:37:04,603
Because he's a detective from
Scotland Yard.

620
00:37:04,811 --> 00:37:05,603
That's why.

621
00:37:06,144 --> 00:37:08,061
Spying on us - on me.

622
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:09,269
Through you.

623
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:12,061
But... why should he? What is
there to find out?

624
00:37:12,603 --> 00:37:13,936
Well, I'm all right.

625
00:37:14,478 --> 00:37:16,978
It must be one of those fellows
who came here tonight.

626
00:37:17,353 --> 00:37:18,978
But you said he was spying on you.

627
00:37:20,228 --> 00:37:21,894
No, not me.

628
00:37:22,978 --> 00:37:24,394
This place, I meant.

629
00:37:24,811 --> 00:37:28,019
Well, if he has anything against anybody,
why didn't he come straight to you?

630
00:37:28,186 --> 00:37:29,061
You'd help him.

631
00:37:30,144 --> 00:37:31,893
I'll talk to "Mr Detective Ted".

632
00:37:31,894 --> 00:37:34,311
No, no, no. I'll speak to him myself.

633
00:37:42,978 --> 00:37:46,103
- Haven't been cleaned all day.
- Righto, guv'nor.

634
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,894
- Where's Ted?
- He's gorn.

635
00:37:55,769 --> 00:37:57,228
Has he gone to Scotland Yard?

636
00:37:57,436 --> 00:37:58,561
Sorry, Mr Verloc.

637
00:37:58,978 --> 00:38:02,519
'Course, I didn't like the idea but I
couldn't refuse. See, it was official.

638
00:38:03,186 --> 00:38:05,228
Mmm. But why? What's wrong?

639
00:38:05,561 --> 00:38:06,801
Did they say what it was about?

640
00:38:06,936 --> 00:38:08,186
Not so far as I know.

641
00:38:09,311 --> 00:38:11,894
You must have been showing some
funny sort of films, I dare say.

642
00:38:12,228 --> 00:38:13,894
You know, perhaps a bit too "hot"?

643
00:38:29,978 --> 00:38:30,686
Was he there?

644
00:38:35,936 --> 00:38:36,686
Post.

645
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:10,144
I was trying to get hold of him since
first thing this morning.

646
00:39:10,353 --> 00:39:11,978
Wasn't there anybody there
to answer?

647
00:39:12,061 --> 00:39:12,686
No.

648
00:39:13,728 --> 00:39:15,353
Well, it's too late to stop him now.

649
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,894
He's gone outwith an order.

650
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:18,686
All right.

651
00:39:19,603 --> 00:39:20,686
All right.

652
00:39:23,978 --> 00:39:25,061
An old man just left this.

653
00:39:25,144 --> 00:39:26,624
I thought he must have
made a mistake.

654
00:39:26,686 --> 00:39:28,519
No, no... th-that's all right.

655
00:39:29,478 --> 00:39:31,353
It's only a pair of birds for Stevie.

656
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:33,353
I was just phoning about it.

657
00:39:33,686 --> 00:39:34,978
You're terribly good to him.

658
00:39:36,936 --> 00:39:38,269
Not to you?

659
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:40,891
You're good to him, you're good
to me. You know that.

660
00:39:41,061 --> 00:39:42,019
Yes, I know.

661
00:39:43,061 --> 00:39:44,186
What made you think of it?

662
00:39:44,561 --> 00:39:47,103
Oh... someone made the suggestion.

663
00:39:48,478 --> 00:39:49,936
Go and call him, will you?

664
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:30,228
Stevie?

665
00:40:32,061 --> 00:40:33,353
What are you doing up there?

666
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,186
There's a surprise for you inside.

667
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:40,769
- What is it?
- Go and see.

668
00:40:48,144 --> 00:40:49,353
There was no one on the door.

669
00:40:49,561 --> 00:40:51,103
Forgive me for busting in like this.

670
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:52,686
We're getting used to it.

671
00:40:53,603 --> 00:40:55,811
I'm afraid we've nothing showing
at this early hour.

672
00:40:55,894 --> 00:40:58,061
I'm sorry, Mrs Verloc, but I'm
here on business.

673
00:40:59,561 --> 00:41:00,978
Same business as last night?

674
00:41:02,603 --> 00:41:04,769
Mrs Verloc, there's nothing
personal in all this.

675
00:41:04,894 --> 00:41:05,936
Isn't there?

676
00:41:06,686 --> 00:41:07,936
You had us fooled all right.

677
00:41:08,436 --> 00:41:10,686
Trying to make Stevie and me
think you were a friend.

678
00:41:10,728 --> 00:41:11,768
Do you think I enjoyed it?

679
00:41:12,144 --> 00:41:13,384
- Then, why did you...
- Listen.

680
00:41:13,478 --> 00:41:15,603
I asked to be taken off this
job this morning.

681
00:41:16,061 --> 00:41:17,061
You can guess why.

682
00:41:18,644 --> 00:41:19,978
But it's not as easy as that.

683
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:21,664
In my job you have to do
as you're told.

684
00:41:21,686 --> 00:41:22,978
And what have you been told?

685
00:41:23,644 --> 00:41:25,185
If it's about the men who came
here last night...

686
00:41:25,186 --> 00:41:26,811
...my husband had nothing
to do with it.

687
00:41:27,019 --> 00:41:28,394
You'd better realise that.

688
00:41:29,228 --> 00:41:31,769
They came here on business.
About the cinema.

689
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:32,811
That's just it...

690
00:41:33,061 --> 00:41:34,701
...you've no idea what their
business was.

691
00:41:34,769 --> 00:41:37,436
Whatever it was, I'm sure my husband
hasn't done anything wrong.

692
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:39,103
I hope you're right.

693
00:41:40,936 --> 00:41:42,057
Why do you say it like that?

694
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:45,479
Because we believe there's something going
on here connected with sabotage.

695
00:41:46,228 --> 00:41:46,644
Sabota...

696
00:41:46,728 --> 00:41:48,644
That blackout the other night.
Do you remember?

697
00:41:50,186 --> 00:41:52,769
Well, my husband hasn't anything
to do with sabotage.

698
00:41:53,103 --> 00:41:55,311
He told me that night he'd
been in all evening.

699
00:41:56,769 --> 00:41:57,728
That wasn't true.

700
00:41:58,478 --> 00:42:00,436
I saw him come back with
my own eyes.

701
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,436
I don't believe it.

702
00:42:03,811 --> 00:42:05,728
You're making things very
difficult for me.

703
00:42:06,394 --> 00:42:08,354
I'm afraid I've got to ask you
a lot of questions.

704
00:42:08,936 --> 00:42:10,103
Now, about those men...

705
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:13,479
But I've told you before, he's the most
harmless person in the whole world.

706
00:42:13,686 --> 00:42:14,846
He wouldn't do anything to...

707
00:42:22,144 --> 00:42:23,864
Did these men arrive together
or one by one?

708
00:42:26,728 --> 00:42:28,769
- Did you recognise any of them?
- No.

709
00:42:29,811 --> 00:42:32,853
Are you quite certain you didn't know
one of them by sight?

710
00:42:32,894 --> 00:42:36,015
- I don't think I ever saw any of them.
- They seemed to know their way around.

711
00:43:29,186 --> 00:43:30,269
Stevie!

712
00:43:39,936 --> 00:43:40,936
They're beauties.

713
00:43:41,186 --> 00:43:42,228
Which one's the hen?

714
00:43:42,894 --> 00:43:45,144
You'll have to wait 'til one of them
lays an egg.

715
00:43:45,644 --> 00:43:48,353
Wouldn't it fool everybody if one
day the gent laid an egg?

716
00:43:48,686 --> 00:43:49,853
Gosh, wouldn't that be funny?

717
00:43:49,936 --> 00:43:50,686
You're right.

718
00:43:51,394 --> 00:43:55,019
Er, by the way, has that two-reeler gone
over to The Canterbury yet?

719
00:43:55,269 --> 00:43:56,561
Oh, there's plenty of time.

720
00:43:56,644 --> 00:43:58,561
Mmm, I was just wondering.

721
00:43:58,603 --> 00:44:00,353
Maybe you could take it along now?

722
00:44:00,728 --> 00:44:04,269
Because... there's another little job I
want doing at the same time.

723
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:06,269
You know, kill two birds
with one stone.

724
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:07,436
Not my birds!

725
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,436
No, no. They'll be here when
you come back.

726
00:44:09,728 --> 00:44:11,686
No, it's er... that er...

727
00:44:11,936 --> 00:44:14,228
...projector gadget wants seeing to.

728
00:44:14,728 --> 00:44:18,061
Harris out at Watford says he'll do it
cheaper than they will in town.

729
00:44:18,394 --> 00:44:20,436
But he can't come right
away and fetch it...

730
00:44:20,478 --> 00:44:21,894
...so, what they do is this.

731
00:44:22,019 --> 00:44:24,478
You leave it in the cloakroom
at Piccadilly Circus.

732
00:44:24,936 --> 00:44:27,144
Harris picks it up - at half past one.

733
00:44:27,478 --> 00:44:29,144
But can he get it without the ticket?

734
00:44:29,603 --> 00:44:33,061
Oh, that's all right. You leave the
ticket with the man.

735
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:37,519
Harris knows me. We've done this before.

736
00:44:37,686 --> 00:44:40,811
- You'd better get along now.
- Well, there's no hurry.

737
00:44:40,853 --> 00:44:44,353
- You'll have to walk all the way.
- Walk? What for'?

738
00:44:44,894 --> 00:44:48,394
You know! You can't take film tins
in public vehicles.

739
00:44:48,436 --> 00:44:49,853
Oh, yes, I forgot.

740
00:44:50,936 --> 00:44:53,686
You needn't tell your sister that you're
going as far as Piccadilly.

741
00:44:53,728 --> 00:44:57,478
You know what she is. Always thinking
you are going to get run over.

742
00:44:57,519 --> 00:44:58,894
Oh, she needn't worry.

743
00:44:59,811 --> 00:45:01,478
I wash. I don't.

744
00:45:03,478 --> 00:45:04,186
Tails it is!

745
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:25,769
For God's sake, why don't you go?!

746
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:32,728
I mean, hurry up. You might be late.

747
00:45:33,228 --> 00:45:35,644
Don't forget, it's got to be there
by 1:30 at the latest.

748
00:45:53,811 --> 00:45:57,331
- Hello Steve. What have you got there?
- I'm taking a two-reeler over to The Canterbury.

749
00:45:57,561 --> 00:46:01,853
Hmm. “Bartholomew the Strangler”. That
sounds a juicy one. Have you seen it?

750
00:46:01,894 --> 00:46:04,394
- Fourteen times!
- Must be quite a wrench parting from it?

751
00:46:04,853 --> 00:46:06,769
- Well, so long, "Bartholomew".
- So long.

752
00:46:06,811 --> 00:46:09,603
- Careful of the crossings.
- I can look after myself, can't I?

753
00:46:09,686 --> 00:46:12,936
- Oh, Steve. Ls Mr Verloc in?
- Yes, I just left him.

754
00:46:21,561 --> 00:46:25,311
I'm afraid I've had to impose on you, Mr Verloc.
I couldn't afford to let you in on this.

755
00:46:25,978 --> 00:46:27,394
Now I can put my cards
on the table.

756
00:46:30,936 --> 00:46:33,144
I've come here to ask for your
help - nothing more.

757
00:46:34,603 --> 00:46:35,228
I see.

758
00:46:36,311 --> 00:46:38,394
About those men who were
here the other night...

759
00:46:39,436 --> 00:46:40,557
...when I dropped in myself.

760
00:46:41,353 --> 00:46:45,603
I've been instructed to get a little information about them.
We'd be very grateful if you'd help us.

761
00:46:46,269 --> 00:46:48,936
Well, any help I can give,
then of course.

762
00:46:49,769 --> 00:46:52,978
About yourself, Mr Verloc. When did you
first come to this country?

763
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:55,686
- Can I get you a drink or something?
- Not now, thanks.

764
00:46:57,436 --> 00:46:59,116
We'll, I've got to think, now.
Let's see...

765
00:46:59,811 --> 00:47:02,769
Perhaps it would be better if you put it
down on paper. Just a formality.

766
00:47:03,811 --> 00:47:08,519
Would you find a pen and ink? We could start right away.
You know, “I, Carl Anton Verloc... ”.

767
00:47:18,853 --> 00:47:21,853
Now, ladies and gentlemen. I want
to ask you a question.

768
00:47:21,894 --> 00:47:26,353
- What is it causes teeth to fall out?
- Why, a punch on the jaw!

769
00:47:26,394 --> 00:47:30,186
The process of decay - inevitable in
all human organisms.

770
00:47:30,269 --> 00:47:34,769
But decay can be arrested, instantaneously
arrested. And by what?

771
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:37,186
- A copper.
- Yes, exactly. But...

772
00:47:37,228 --> 00:47:41,853
...if I may say so, by rather more than one
copper - by a few coppers.

773
00:47:41,936 --> 00:47:46,936
I have here in my hand, a tube of that
remarkable preparation, Salvodont.

774
00:47:46,978 --> 00:47:51,853
"Toothache".

775
00:47:51,894 --> 00:47:57,561
Sixpence for the small tube, and a shilling for
the large tube, containing four times as much.

776
00:47:57,686 --> 00:47:59,566
Now let me give you just
a little demonstration.

777
00:47:59,936 --> 00:48:03,103
Now, if somebody... Ah! I see
here a young gentleman...

778
00:48:03,144 --> 00:48:05,186
...who will, I'm sure, be happy
to assist me.

779
00:48:05,228 --> 00:48:06,894
- No, I wouldn't.
- Yes, you would.

780
00:48:06,936 --> 00:48:09,144
Come on - bung him up.

781
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:10,811
- In the chair, sir, if you don't mind.
- But I...

782
00:48:10,894 --> 00:48:14,186
- Allow me to relieve you of the toffee, eh?
- It isn't toffee and I...

783
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:16,769
All right, all right, all right! Stay where you are.
Don't get excited. Now then...

784
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:22,519
...here we are. The first thing to do is take
the tube in the left hand and remove the cap.

785
00:48:22,561 --> 00:48:28,019
Like so. Then we pick up a toothbrush, and
we squeeze some of the Salvodont...

786
00:48:28,103 --> 00:48:32,936
...along the bristles, like so. Then, I want
you to observe, ladies and gentlemen...

787
00:48:32,978 --> 00:48:36,019
- ...that the young gentleman's teeth are very dirty.
- They are not!

788
00:48:36,061 --> 00:48:38,394
Yes, they are. Now, come along. Open your
mouth, that's a good boy.

789
00:48:38,436 --> 00:48:40,353
We now proceed to use the brush.

790
00:48:40,394 --> 00:48:45,269
Now with your ordinary commercial dentrifices,
what 'appens? It is either too gritty...

791
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:49,853
...and takes all the enamel orf - or it
ain't, and it don't take nothing orf!

792
00:48:49,894 --> 00:48:52,643
But with Salvodont, that's
the 'appy medium.

793
00:48:52,644 --> 00:48:57,936
Neither too strong, nor too weak. It
performs the functions that nature forgot.

794
00:48:57,978 --> 00:49:02,728
It cleanses the teeth, refreshes the mouth
and removes all traces of 'alitosis.

795
00:49:02,811 --> 00:49:04,978
- Alley... what?
- "Bad breath" to you, sir.

796
00:49:05,019 --> 00:49:07,103
- Same to you.
- Thank you, I don't need it.

797
00:49:07,186 --> 00:49:10,853
Come on. There you are, now. Relax,
sonny - don't be afraid.

798
00:49:11,394 --> 00:49:15,436
Now, ladies and gentlemen. You will observe
that I have, unfortunately, disarranged...

799
00:49:15,478 --> 00:49:19,186
...the young gentleman's hair. But
that is easily attended to.

800
00:49:19,269 --> 00:49:24,061
Now, I have here, a bottle of Glosswell.
A shilling for that size.

801
00:49:24,144 --> 00:49:27,853
But I have a large size - four times the
size - which is only eighteen pence.

802
00:49:27,894 --> 00:49:30,103
I will now give you a demonstration
of how it's used.

803
00:49:30,144 --> 00:49:32,769
You put it on the 'air
like that, you see?

804
00:49:32,811 --> 00:49:36,228
It's remarkable stuff, which is guaranteed
to give the appearance...

805
00:49:36,269 --> 00:49:39,061
...of patent leather to the
human thatch.

806
00:49:39,103 --> 00:49:42,728
You are now "groomed for stardom",
as they say.

807
00:49:42,769 --> 00:49:45,061
Go on, buzz off, you little basket. Go on.

808
00:50:11,769 --> 00:50:13,269
What do you want? Go on hop it!

809
00:50:13,311 --> 00:50:17,686
Souvenirs for the Lord Mayor's Show!
Souvenirs for the Lord Mayor's Show!

810
00:50:31,228 --> 00:50:37,603
Hey, where are you going? Go on, back to
your place! Go on. Go on. Go on!

811
00:50:37,853 --> 00:50:39,686
Go on, son. Get right back.

812
00:50:50,936 --> 00:50:52,269
Here they come.

813
00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:48,478
I say, do you think we'll get to
Piccadilly Circus by 1:30?

814
00:52:48,561 --> 00:52:51,853
Yes, 1:30 in the morning. You got
to meet a young lady there?

815
00:52:52,561 --> 00:52:55,353
Here, you can't bring those there in a public vehicle.
They're films, ain't they?

816
00:52:55,394 --> 00:52:55,811
Yes.

817
00:52:55,853 --> 00:52:58,019
Then they're flammable. Go on -
hop off, big boy.

818
00:52:58,061 --> 00:53:01,501
But I've got to get to Piccadilly. Can't I
leave them out on the platform or somewhere?

819
00:53:01,728 --> 00:53:05,977
Ah... it's “Bartholomew the Strangler”. Oh,
well, as it's you Bartholomew, me old feller...

820
00:53:05,978 --> 00:53:09,186
...you can stay - as long as you promise not
to set about me or any of the passengers.

821
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:09,936
Thank you.

822
00:55:20,269 --> 00:55:24,436
Well, now. Everything seems to be all right.
Will you have your drink after all?

823
00:55:25,644 --> 00:55:26,311
No, thanks.

824
00:55:32,894 --> 00:55:34,103
Come in.

825
00:55:34,811 --> 00:55:37,853
Oh, excuse me. Will you ring
up "Whitehall 1212"?

826
00:55:39,228 --> 00:55:40,144
May I use your phone?

827
00:55:49,728 --> 00:55:51,608
Put me through to Superintendent
Talbot, please.

828
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:56,906
Spencer here, sir.

829
00:56:08,519 --> 00:56:11,228
A whole busload of people have been
blown up in the West End.

830
00:56:11,436 --> 00:56:13,936
- How awful.
- What time?

831
00:56:14,978 --> 00:56:15,811
Why do you ask?

832
00:56:16,936 --> 00:56:20,853
Well, after all, I can't be in two places
at the same time, can I?

833
00:56:21,936 --> 00:56:22,519
I suppose not.

834
00:56:27,936 --> 00:56:29,103
I may be back, later on.

835
00:57:06,561 --> 00:57:09,061
- Got on to anything?
- I'm not sure.

836
00:57:09,144 --> 00:57:11,686
Well, make up your mind.
What is it anyway?

837
00:57:13,019 --> 00:57:16,311
"Bartho... ". "Bartholomew" something?

838
00:57:16,561 --> 00:57:18,228
Well, that's a film tin, isn't it?

839
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:21,644
I thought you said Verloc hadn't been
out since this morning.

840
00:57:21,686 --> 00:57:22,352
He hadn't.

841
00:57:22,353 --> 00:57:23,478
Well, you'd best go back there and...

842
00:57:23,561 --> 00:57:25,436
- ...see if that's one of their films.
- You want me, sir?

843
00:57:25,478 --> 00:57:27,311
Yes, yes. You'd better join Hollingshead
at the bird shop.

844
00:57:27,353 --> 00:57:27,811
Yes, sir.

845
00:57:27,853 --> 00:57:29,493
Don't go inside. Just keep
your eyes open.

846
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:31,769
- I will, sir.
- All right, Spencer - cut off.

847
00:57:35,978 --> 00:57:37,936
Is that anything to do with it,
Mr Spencer?

848
00:57:39,269 --> 00:57:41,394
“Bartholomew the Strangler”.

849
00:57:41,728 --> 00:57:42,849
That's a film tin, isn't it?

850
00:57:45,103 --> 00:57:47,436
No. Sardines.

851
00:57:57,394 --> 00:57:59,103
News! Street bomb sensation!

852
00:57:59,144 --> 00:58:01,394
Late extra news!
Street bomb sensation!

853
00:58:04,394 --> 00:58:08,394
He's all right. He can take care of himself.
You've got nothing to worry about.

854
00:58:08,894 --> 00:58:11,811
Late extra news! Street bomb sensation!
Big bomb sensation!

855
00:58:11,853 --> 00:58:14,394
- Give me a penny.
- Late extra news! Street bomb sensation!

856
00:58:14,936 --> 00:58:17,686
Late extra news! Late extra news!
Street bomb sensation!

857
00:58:18,019 --> 00:58:20,936
Late extra news! Late extra news!
Street bomb sensation!

858
00:58:34,853 --> 00:58:38,228
- Look at that.
- Look, the lady's fainted.

859
00:58:39,936 --> 00:58:43,561
Give her air.

860
00:58:54,019 --> 00:58:55,061
I want Mr Verloc.

861
00:58:57,019 --> 00:58:58,728
I want to see Mr Verloc.

862
00:59:01,978 --> 00:59:04,644
I didn't mean any harm to
come to the boy.

863
00:59:06,978 --> 00:59:09,811
Come on, we've got to
think of tomorrow.

864
00:59:11,144 --> 00:59:14,769
You'll need all your wits about you,
if they get on to me.

865
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:19,186
You must answer a fellow.

866
00:59:23,144 --> 00:59:24,478
Do be reasonable.

867
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:28,603
What would it have been...
if you had lost me?

868
00:59:35,686 --> 00:59:38,061
That swine in the aquarium...

869
00:59:39,769 --> 00:59:44,269
...silly jeering dangerous brute with
no more sense than...

870
00:59:44,936 --> 00:59:47,144
You didn't know. Quite right too.

871
00:59:48,103 --> 00:59:51,686
I'm not the chap to...
worry a woman...

872
00:59:53,103 --> 00:59:54,311
...that's fond of me.

873
00:59:55,728 --> 00:59:57,519
You have no business to know.

874
01:00:09,144 --> 01:00:11,061
You'll have to pull yourself
together, my girl.

875
01:00:12,144 --> 01:00:13,936
What's done can't be undone.

876
01:00:21,103 --> 01:00:22,103
You go to bed now.

877
01:00:23,894 --> 01:00:25,603
What you want is a good cry.

878
01:00:27,936 --> 01:00:29,561
I know how you feel.

879
01:00:31,144 --> 01:00:32,894
Do you think it doesn't touch me?

880
01:00:33,353 --> 01:00:35,644
Do you think I fixed it so
that he'd be killed?

881
01:00:36,769 --> 01:00:39,561
No, but I tell you who did.

882
01:00:40,019 --> 01:00:43,311
Your Scotland Yard friend from
next door - Ted. Blame him.

883
01:00:44,186 --> 01:00:47,561
I'd have carried the thing myself, but
he was hanging around watching, spying.

884
01:00:47,603 --> 01:00:48,894
I couldn't get away.

885
01:00:59,603 --> 01:01:02,478
Listen... It's done, now...

886
01:01:03,644 --> 01:01:04,811
...and there's the future...

887
01:01:06,144 --> 01:01:10,103
Perhaps... I don't know?
Perhaps, if we...

888
01:01:11,644 --> 01:01:13,061
...had a kid of our own?

889
01:02:23,186 --> 01:02:26,603
"Who killed Cock Robin?"

890
01:02:26,811 --> 01:02:28,269
"Who killed Cock Robin?"

891
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:32,853
Everything's dished up. Young Stevie
ain't in, but I've laid for him.

892
01:02:32,936 --> 01:02:34,644
Well, I'm getting along now.

893
01:02:36,811 --> 01:02:41,603
"Who who who who whooo
killed Cock Robin?"

894
01:02:42,269 --> 01:02:45,228
"Who killed Cock Robin?"

895
01:02:45,269 --> 01:02:47,686
"Who killed Cock Robin?"

896
01:02:47,728 --> 01:02:51,686
"Who got him with a shot and
put him on the spot?"

897
01:03:01,103 --> 01:03:02,603
Pulled yourself together a bit?

898
01:03:03,936 --> 01:03:04,936
That's better.

899
01:03:15,019 --> 01:03:19,228
Never green. Why can't that woman
cook green stuff any better?

900
01:03:19,978 --> 01:03:23,603
Surely she's been long enough here to know
how fond I am of that sort of thing.

901
01:03:48,978 --> 01:03:50,811
I don't think I want any cabbage.

902
01:03:51,728 --> 01:03:53,478
Couldn't we send next door for some...

903
01:05:24,603 --> 01:05:27,436
No, don't!

904
01:05:48,603 --> 01:05:51,103
Stevie! Stevie!

905
01:06:40,686 --> 01:06:42,978
- You've heard?
- Yes.

906
01:06:44,186 --> 01:06:45,561
I'm terribly sorry.

907
01:06:47,144 --> 01:06:48,519
I don't know what to say.

908
01:06:51,269 --> 01:06:53,353
- You know why I'm here.
- Yes.

909
01:06:54,353 --> 01:06:55,519
I'll have to arrest him.

910
01:06:57,269 --> 01:06:57,978
Yes.

911
01:06:58,894 --> 01:07:02,228
I'll help him if I can, of course.
For your sake, if not for his.

912
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,061
I'd do anything for you. You
know that, don't you?

913
01:07:06,811 --> 01:07:08,228
That's very good of you, Ted.

914
01:07:08,936 --> 01:07:10,856
There isn't anything you can
do for either of us.

915
01:07:11,394 --> 01:07:12,769
Things aren't as bad as that.

916
01:07:13,436 --> 01:07:17,353
The evidence is against him, I admit. But
nothing's going to happen to you.

917
01:07:21,269 --> 01:07:23,228
I know this isn't a very good
time to tell you.

918
01:07:24,436 --> 01:07:26,478
I shouldn't tell you at all,
I suppose.

919
01:07:27,394 --> 01:07:29,853
But... before I take him along,
I want you to know that...

920
01:07:31,061 --> 01:07:33,103
...what happens to you means
to a lot me.

921
01:07:33,561 --> 01:07:36,686
I didn't want to tell you how I felt
about you, but there it is.

922
01:08:08,686 --> 01:08:12,519
I guess I'd better get my coat if we're
going. I can't stop shivering.

923
01:08:12,603 --> 01:08:15,269
- For God's sake, what happened?
- He killed Stevie.

924
01:08:17,686 --> 01:08:20,269
- I feel warmer now. Let's go.
- Go where?

925
01:08:20,519 --> 01:08:22,894
- To the police, of course.
- No. Hold on! Wait a minute.

926
01:08:39,353 --> 01:08:41,186
Take a look at this book!

927
01:08:41,436 --> 01:08:43,978
Do you realise what this
means to you?

928
01:09:14,603 --> 01:09:17,603
- Listen to me. You can't go through with this.
- Ted, let me go.

929
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:21,686
You're not guilty. I know it was an accident.
Anyway, you only did the hangman's job for him.

930
01:09:21,853 --> 01:09:24,728
- Please, let me go.
- I know the facts, but no one else does.

931
01:09:24,811 --> 01:09:26,644
What chance would you stand
with a judge and jury?

932
01:09:26,769 --> 01:09:28,228
I don't care anymore.

933
01:09:28,894 --> 01:09:31,334
You're telling me you've nothing more
to live for. Is that it?

934
01:09:31,769 --> 01:09:32,853
Look at me.

935
01:09:34,894 --> 01:09:35,686
Ted!

936
01:09:36,186 --> 01:09:38,347
My dear, we're going to get out
of all this. Clear out.

937
01:09:38,936 --> 01:09:42,936
- You know it's no good. You'd just ruin yourself.
- Oh, to hell with that!

938
01:09:43,478 --> 01:09:47,159
It's Saturday night. We don't need passports for
the Continent if we ask for weekend tickets.

939
01:09:47,228 --> 01:09:48,811
The train leaves at nine.

940
01:09:49,853 --> 01:09:52,686
Will someone try and get in that room?
Mrs Jones or anyone?

941
01:09:52,728 --> 01:09:55,019
Mrs Jones comes in at eight
o'clock in the morning.

942
01:09:55,311 --> 01:09:57,728
Eight o'clock? And you say
we've got no chance?

943
01:09:57,978 --> 01:10:00,269
Why, we've twelve hours start before
anyone can find him.

944
01:10:00,936 --> 01:10:03,137
You shut up! I don't want to hear
another word from you.

945
01:10:03,478 --> 01:10:07,394
Now, go straight to that cinema and bring that birdcage
right back - before the police get there and find it.

946
01:10:07,436 --> 01:10:09,311
How could you be so mad as
to do such a thing?!

947
01:10:09,603 --> 01:10:12,311
- A birdcage with a bomb in it.
- My dear, I couldn't help...

948
01:10:12,394 --> 01:10:14,853
Well, you can help now. Here's your
hat and your coat.

949
01:10:14,894 --> 01:10:18,103
- My dear, but what of the risk?
- Risk? Who to? You?

950
01:10:18,144 --> 01:10:21,811
What about me and the child? Haven't our
lives been one long risk for months?

951
01:10:21,894 --> 01:10:25,353
Now, go on. Get into that taxi.
And get that birdcage!

952
01:10:26,561 --> 01:10:28,144
Bijou Cinema, Penfork Road.

953
01:10:41,269 --> 01:10:42,394
Follow that taxi.

954
01:10:46,894 --> 01:10:48,054
Put this through to the Yard.

955
01:10:49,103 --> 01:10:53,311
- "Police van..." What's our number?
- UDC4768.

956
01:10:53,353 --> 01:10:58,144
Man under observation
has just left bird shop..."

957
01:10:58,186 --> 01:11:01,769
"...is making for the Bijou cinema,
in a taxi which we are following."

958
01:11:02,269 --> 01:11:03,603
"Any instructions?"

959
01:11:09,061 --> 01:11:12,436
“Arrest man and Verloc
on arrival at cinema."

960
01:11:12,478 --> 01:11:14,269
"Chief Inspector coming from Yard.”

961
01:11:16,186 --> 01:11:18,478
I'm all right now. I just...

962
01:11:18,519 --> 01:11:20,320
You mustn't look as though
you've been crying.

963
01:11:20,478 --> 01:11:22,353
- I'm all right.
- Come on.

964
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:23,936
Ted?

965
01:11:26,436 --> 01:11:29,019
Whatever happens...

966
01:11:47,103 --> 01:11:48,644
Is Mr Verloc in?

967
01:11:56,561 --> 01:11:57,686
What is it?

968
01:12:01,144 --> 01:12:02,061
Police.

969
01:12:02,436 --> 01:12:04,103
- Come on.
- Not that way.

970
01:12:16,811 --> 01:12:18,731
- Are you in charge?
- Sorry. No time now, madam.

971
01:12:18,769 --> 01:12:21,311
- But I'm Mrs Verloc.
- Oh! Where have you been, Spencer?

972
01:12:21,353 --> 01:12:21,853
Look here, sir...

973
01:12:21,894 --> 01:12:23,603
He was just taking me along
to the police station.

974
01:12:23,644 --> 01:12:26,144
Oh, I see. Does Mrs Verloc know we
want to question her?

975
01:12:26,269 --> 01:12:29,186
Yes, he's explained all that. I told him
I wanted to make a statement.

976
01:12:29,228 --> 01:12:31,603
- Statement, eh? What kind of statement?
- Mrs Verloc, you can make your...

977
01:12:31,769 --> 01:12:32,936
...statement later, at the station.

978
01:12:32,978 --> 01:12:35,853
All right, Spencer. I'm in charge of this.
Is the statement to do with your husband?

979
01:12:35,894 --> 01:12:38,186
- The old man's gone through to the back, sir.
- Right, I'm coming over.

980
01:12:38,353 --> 01:12:40,061
You wait here. Your husband will
be along in a minute.

981
01:12:40,103 --> 01:12:41,311
- It's no...
- But, Mrs Verloc!

982
01:12:41,353 --> 01:12:44,769
Yes, no time now, I'm afraid. Later. You
stay here by the car, Spencer.

983
01:12:44,811 --> 01:12:49,103
How many men have gone
round the back?

984
01:13:03,603 --> 01:13:04,686
Mr Verloc?

985
01:13:25,686 --> 01:13:28,311
- Mr Verloc?
- Come on, grandpa. Open up.

986
01:13:28,353 --> 01:13:32,603
- It'll save a lot of trouble.
- You open that door, I'll blow the place sky high!

987
01:13:32,936 --> 01:13:35,394
- Perhaps he's got a bomb?
- Half a tick. Better clear the cinema!

988
01:13:35,436 --> 01:13:37,876
- I'll look after the old man.
- No, thanks. I'm staying here.

989
01:13:38,269 --> 01:13:40,669
- You've got a wife.
- All the more reason why I should stop.

990
01:13:40,686 --> 01:13:44,061
Go on - get the audience out.

991
01:13:50,228 --> 01:13:52,186
He's gone to the back. He's got a bomb.
Says he's going to use it.

992
01:13:52,394 --> 01:13:54,227
Bomb? Ls Verloc inside too'?

993
01:13:54,228 --> 01:13:56,188
I don't know. Perhaps something's
happened to him.

994
01:14:01,686 --> 01:14:04,936
Ladies and gentlemen, I must ask you
all to leave the cinema.

995
01:14:23,769 --> 01:14:26,490
- Mrs Verloc, is your husband inside there?
- She knows nothing, sir!

996
01:14:26,519 --> 01:14:29,686
- Why do you keep interfering, Spencer?
- Yes, he's inside.

997
01:14:29,728 --> 01:14:34,353
The old man's got a bomb. What's your
husband's nerve like? Can he control him?

998
01:14:34,394 --> 01:14:36,311
- No.
- He can't?

999
01:14:37,269 --> 01:14:37,978
He's dead!

1000
01:15:03,769 --> 01:15:06,560
The roof's gone. The whole of the back
of the place - clean blown off.

1001
01:15:06,561 --> 01:15:07,311
Anybody...?

1002
01:15:07,353 --> 01:15:09,894
All the audience was clear,
thank goodness.

1003
01:15:11,186 --> 01:15:14,894
God, I saw some things in
the war, but...

1004
01:15:14,936 --> 01:15:17,394
- ls there enough left to identify?
- I wouldn't say so, sir.

1005
01:15:17,936 --> 01:15:20,936
You'd better get a first-aid man to
attend to that head of yours.

1006
01:15:22,811 --> 01:15:23,936
Spencer.

1007
01:15:26,644 --> 01:15:31,769
You'd better look after Mrs Verloc. Her
husband's dead - blown to glory.

1008
01:15:33,478 --> 01:15:34,686
You can break it to her.

1009
01:15:35,728 --> 01:15:37,311
There'll be a few enquiries later.

1010
01:15:38,144 --> 01:15:40,519
There's nothing against her,
so far as I can gather.

1011
01:15:40,603 --> 01:15:42,144
Yes, sir.

1012
01:15:54,561 --> 01:15:56,686
- Make way, there.
- That's queer!

1013
01:15:57,561 --> 01:16:01,144
Is that girl psychic? She said
that Verloc was...

1014
01:16:01,186 --> 01:16:04,061
Dead, sir? Well, you don't need second
sight in a case like this.

1015
01:16:04,103 --> 01:16:05,478
But she said it before.

1016
01:16:07,478 --> 01:16:08,811
Or was it after...?

1017
01:16:10,894 --> 01:16:12,269
I can't remember.
