1
00:01:12,415 --> 00:01:16,556
This is the Letterman General Hosiptal
at San Francisco, California.

2
00:01:16,616 --> 00:01:21,219
For those outside these gates the
war is over, a thing of the past.

3
00:01:21,279 --> 00:01:26,888
For those behind these gates there's a
grim, hard, bitter fight still going on.

4
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:31,518
Take one case, the case
of Eddie Rice, age 33.

5
00:01:31,578 --> 00:01:37,206
Enlisted from Los Angeles, 1943.
Holder of the Silver Star, but today...

6
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:43,026
A name and date number, a medical file.
For five years a chart on a hospital bed.

7
00:01:43,256 --> 00:01:47,340
A victim of amnesia.
A mind with a blocked out past.

8
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:51,127
Where were you born, Eddie?
Who are your parents?

9
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,912
Any brothers? Sisters?

10
00:01:54,277 --> 00:01:58,775
Where did you go to school?
What's your trade? Profession?

11
00:01:59,433 --> 00:02:01,748
Are you rich?
Poor?

12
00:02:02,051 --> 00:02:03,689
Got a girl?

13
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,289
Married?

14
00:02:05,349 --> 00:02:06,869
I don't know.

15
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:09,015
I don't know!

16
00:02:09,824 --> 00:02:11,537
I can't remember.

17
00:02:12,444 --> 00:02:14,571
I just can't remember, doctor.

18
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,922
You had me open. What did you quit for?
-We did the best we could, Eddie.

19
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:33,439
It'll just have to stay there.

20
00:02:34,606 --> 00:02:38,483
Is that final?
-Unless you want your name on a headstone.

21
00:02:38,543 --> 00:02:43,592
That shrapnel's too deep in your brain.
Scar tissue has grown all around it.

22
00:02:43,652 --> 00:02:46,980
Believe me, we tried.
-Yeah, I guess you did.

23
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:52,551
Where do I go from here?
-Eddie, there are two kinds of amnesia:

24
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:54,895
psychological and organic.

25
00:02:55,178 --> 00:03:00,240
The psychological form is temporary, but
it can be cured through psychotherapy.

26
00:03:01,016 --> 00:03:03,876
Yours is organic, it's permanent.

27
00:03:04,347 --> 00:03:07,772
That piece of steel in your brain
has blocked out your memory.

28
00:03:07,832 --> 00:03:10,863
Which doesn't leave me much
of a future, does it?

29
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:15,071
Of course it does, physically
you're normal and healthy.

30
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:17,771
You've received the maximum
medical benefits

31
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:22,559
You've completed training courses that make
you fit to hold down a job and face life.

32
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:26,540
With no address, no next
of kin, nothing.

33
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:29,567
Enlisted from Los Angeles...

34
00:03:29,627 --> 00:03:32,397
Intelligence ran that down
for us, remember?

35
00:03:32,867 --> 00:03:35,818
Oh sure, there were a lot of
people named Rice there...

36
00:03:36,026 --> 00:03:37,682
but not this Eddie Rice.

37
00:03:37,742 --> 00:03:41,777
But, Army Intelligence didn't mow
Los Angeles lawns as a kid, Eddie.

38
00:03:41,837 --> 00:03:44,292
They didn't trade at the corner market.

39
00:03:44,352 --> 00:03:48,775
They didn't work with people in a factory,
in an office, as you might have done.

40
00:03:48,986 --> 00:03:50,136
Now...

41
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:54,081
If you went down there...and ran
into somebody who knew you,

42
00:03:54,141 --> 00:03:55,918
just one person...

43
00:03:56,384 --> 00:03:57,694
Yes...

44
00:03:58,992 --> 00:04:01,702
If I ran into just one person
who knew me.

45
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:03,689
One guy...

46
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:07,149
Who would come up to me and say:

47
00:04:07,616 --> 00:04:08,775
"Eddie."

48
00:04:08,986 --> 00:04:10,491
"Eddie Rice."

49
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:12,253
"How have you been?"

50
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:14,132
"Where have you been?"

51
00:04:14,192 --> 00:04:15,577
That's it, Eddie.

52
00:04:15,637 --> 00:04:18,766
And then, they'd tell me about
someone else I used to know.

53
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,626
And, I'd meet somebody else.

54
00:04:22,635 --> 00:04:24,141
And another...

55
00:04:25,342 --> 00:04:26,908
And another...

56
00:04:57,774 --> 00:05:00,996
<i>Sure, it scares you to go out into
a world you don't remember...</i>

57
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:02,959
<i>but you're here now.</i>

58
00:05:03,742 --> 00:05:05,473
<i>It'll be a new life.</i>

59
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,295
<i>A new start.</i>

60
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:10,189
<i>Find yourself a place to live.</i>

61
00:05:10,957 --> 00:05:12,613
<i>Get yourself a job.</i>

62
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,540
<i>Get going.</i>

63
00:05:15,353 --> 00:05:16,919
<i>Get going, Eddie!</i>

64
00:05:19,198 --> 00:05:20,357
Eddie!

65
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:22,736
You know, it's a small world, Eddie.

66
00:05:22,796 --> 00:05:25,266
We came down here to pick
up a little of one thing,

67
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:28,650
and we ran into a little of another!
-A lot of us thought you were dead.

68
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,851
Yes, and...those that didn't hoped you
were. What are you doing in town?

69
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:36,642
I'm just in from San Francisco.

70
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:40,060
I didn't ask you that.
-He asked you what you were doing in town.

71
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,354
I cam here to look up some...people.

72
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,989
Funny, I...I had a feeling that was it.

73
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:48,443
Anderson one of them?
-Anderson?

74
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:50,698
Maybe.

75
00:05:50,758 --> 00:05:54,251
I think you're lying, Eddie. I don't think you
were gonna look up Anderson at all.

76
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:57,458
Barrett, do you think he was gonna
look up Anderson? -No, Joe.

77
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:00,108
Not Anderson.
-I'll tell you what...

78
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:02,737
I got a car and nothing
to do for a while...

79
00:06:02,797 --> 00:06:05,478
Let's go see Anderson together.
Any objections?

80
00:06:07,616 --> 00:06:09,016
No objections.

81
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:11,256
Stick around, Kelly may still show.

82
00:06:11,452 --> 00:06:12,506
Let's go.

83
00:06:35,122 --> 00:06:37,667
'Honorable discharge of Edward Rice.'

84
00:06:41,972 --> 00:06:43,568
What's the gimmick?

85
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,399
If you'd put away your blackjacks
long enough

86
00:06:46,459 --> 00:06:48,431
maybe I could get it through
your heads that...

87
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,714
I don't know what you're talking about.

88
00:06:50,774 --> 00:06:52,912
You got yourself a sense
of humor, Eddie.

89
00:06:52,972 --> 00:06:56,010
You think you come back here with
a dumb look and a Silver Star...

90
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,958
That changes a no good heel?
-But, I'm trying to tell you that...

91
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,382
You don't have to tell us
anything about yourself.

92
00:07:01,442 --> 00:07:03,881
We got it all down in black and white.

93
00:07:06,019 --> 00:07:07,630
Read it, Riccardi.

94
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:09,313
We didn't dream it up.

95
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:12,355
Possession of a weapon
with intent to kill.

96
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:14,553
Suspicion of murder.

97
00:07:17,184 --> 00:07:18,566
<i>Riccardi...</i>

98
00:07:19,274 --> 00:07:20,960
<i>Eddie Riccardi.</i>

99
00:07:21,638 --> 00:07:25,236
<i>That's not me, it can't be.
It only looks like me!</i>

100
00:07:26,348 --> 00:07:29,103
<i>I better get out of here!
I've got to get out!</i>

101
00:07:29,163 --> 00:07:33,093
Five years ago we hustled you out of town,
for good. Now what are you here for?

102
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:35,939
<i>You've got to play ball.</i>

103
00:07:35,999 --> 00:07:39,153
<i>You need time. You need more
time to find out about yourself.</i>

104
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,894
Riccardi's just playing dumb, Captain.

105
00:07:42,556 --> 00:07:44,122
Put him in the lockup.

106
00:07:44,498 --> 00:07:47,085
I'm finding about these...
discharge papers.

107
00:07:47,145 --> 00:07:49,358
If they're phonies, we'll pin a
real one on him.

108
00:07:49,418 --> 00:07:50,999
Just a minute, Lieutenant.

109
00:07:52,426 --> 00:07:56,627
I guess, maybe I didn't want the army
to know about Eddie...Riccardi.

110
00:07:57,317 --> 00:08:00,133
The only friends I have
know me as Eddie Rice.

111
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:02,813
I'd like to keep it that way.

112
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:05,945
That's probably the first honest
thing you've ever said.

113
00:08:06,005 --> 00:08:07,537
Pick up your things.

114
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:14,008
Be Eddie Rice in some other
town, but not here.

115
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:18,540
Now, we can't hold you, but...you step
out of line once and we step on you.

116
00:08:26,034 --> 00:08:28,278
Notice anything different
about him, Williams?

117
00:08:28,338 --> 00:08:31,138
Nothing! If Riccardi stays in town
there's gonna be trouble.

118
00:08:31,198 --> 00:08:34,210
I don't know. He had a strange
look about him.

119
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:37,934
Send to Washington for a complete
report on Edward Rice.

120
00:08:37,994 --> 00:08:40,870
That Silver Star, you really
do something to get one.

121
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:43,686
Yeah, buy it in a pawn
shop for two bits.

122
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,944
Nina, my sweet!
My beautiful, lovely...

123
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:07,609
All right, Nick! Let's keep
it all business.

124
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:13,240
Who is it this time?
-Petey. Suspicion of robbery.

125
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,251
Get him out before they start
shifting him around. -Petey?

126
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,588
Him?

127
00:09:17,648 --> 00:09:19,726
He wouldn't steal his own shadow.

128
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:22,056
That was William's gag to get
him out of the way.

129
00:09:22,116 --> 00:09:25,670
I wouldn't know. Bail's $1000.
-Inflation!

130
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,823
That's the whole trouble these days.

131
00:09:28,847 --> 00:09:30,714
Alexander, he unhappy?

132
00:09:31,252 --> 00:09:34,188
Nick. Keep your mind on your business.

133
00:09:34,248 --> 00:09:36,233
Let Vince worry about his, huh?

134
00:09:36,293 --> 00:09:39,259
Sure, beautiful Sure.
Forget I mentioned it.

135
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:55,970
Take my advice, you leave town.

136
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,837
I've got things to do.

137
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,125
Adios, boy! You're on your own.

138
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:05,941
Kelly never showed.

139
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:07,071
Odd.

140
00:10:07,131 --> 00:10:08,606
We'll hear from him.

141
00:10:18,132 --> 00:10:20,074
One of the usual fronts?

142
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:24,064
You have a lot of Jane Does, Nick.
Use one of them.

143
00:10:26,732 --> 00:10:28,328
Of course, there's a big difference

144
00:10:28,388 --> 00:10:30,617
between the Florida oranges
and the California oranges.

145
00:10:30,677 --> 00:10:33,131
At least that's what the Chamber
of Commerce in Florida says.

146
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:35,661
And the Chamber of Commerce
in California says...

147
00:10:35,872 --> 00:10:37,874
Orange juice, please.
-Yes, ma'am.

148
00:10:41,153 --> 00:10:42,388
Eddie.

149
00:10:44,691 --> 00:10:47,281
I thought it was you from
across the street.

150
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:49,940
Hello.

151
00:10:51,204 --> 00:10:53,794
Is that the only thing
you've got to say?

152
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,640
Well, there's a lot more
I could say, but...

153
00:10:57,107 --> 00:10:58,311
but you...

154
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:00,609
Let's see...

155
00:11:01,814 --> 00:11:03,425
Nacy Morgan?

156
00:11:03,711 --> 00:11:05,051
Nora Murphy?

157
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:09,176
No, you don't look like Nora Murphy.
-What'd you come back for, Eddie?

158
00:11:10,216 --> 00:11:12,610
A man has a right to come
home, hasn't he?

159
00:11:14,552 --> 00:11:17,699
My car is across the street,
I'll take you there.

160
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:18,994
Sure!

161
00:11:19,175 --> 00:11:20,228
Thanks.

162
00:11:45,318 --> 00:11:47,089
Vince know you're back?

163
00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:48,360
Vince?

164
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,025
Should he?

165
00:11:51,762 --> 00:11:53,419
You oughta know.

166
00:12:02,797 --> 00:12:04,499
Thanks for the lift.

167
00:12:07,503 --> 00:12:08,828
Coming in?

168
00:12:09,264 --> 00:12:11,447
Who said this was the end of the road?

169
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,091
Who's complaining? Not me.

170
00:12:40,205 --> 00:12:41,530
Checking in?

171
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:42,870
Long?

172
00:12:44,466 --> 00:12:45,896
I don't know yet.

173
00:12:46,739 --> 00:12:48,019
Alone?

174
00:12:48,648 --> 00:12:49,672
Yes.

175
00:12:52,517 --> 00:12:55,393
Edward Rice...San Francisco.

176
00:12:58,702 --> 00:13:00,042
304.

177
00:13:03,234 --> 00:13:06,757
I'll throw the stuff in the room and
be right back. -If you say so.

178
00:13:29,744 --> 00:13:32,665
Hello? hello, this is Nina.
I want to talk to Vince.

179
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:33,885
He's busy.

180
00:13:33,945 --> 00:13:36,203
Not too busy for what
I've got to tell him.

181
00:13:36,263 --> 00:13:37,479
<i>He's not here.</i>

182
00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:41,379
Look, let's not keep where he is a
secret it might upset your whole future.

183
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:42,945
Put me through to him!

184
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:56,719
You talk too much.

185
00:13:57,397 --> 00:13:59,189
Another treatment, Kelly?

186
00:14:00,453 --> 00:14:01,603
Any...

187
00:14:02,265 --> 00:14:04,750
Any second...breaks, Vince?

188
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:09,176
I'm easy to do business with.

189
00:14:10,165 --> 00:14:11,520
If you talk...

190
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,830
you live.

191
00:14:14,034 --> 00:14:16,865
All i want to hear is your
angle with Joe Williams.

192
00:14:19,271 --> 00:14:22,463
Give him a cigarette, Danny.
It'll relax him.

193
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,609
I'm...trusting you, Vince.

194
00:14:30,834 --> 00:14:32,792
Sure. Sure, Kelly.

195
00:14:33,474 --> 00:14:35,612
I told you we'd turn you loose.

196
00:14:35,672 --> 00:14:37,388
You understand how I...

197
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:40,942
How a guy feels when he's been
kicked out of the organization?

198
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,633
I know...

199
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,533
I shouldn't of been a sucker and
told Williams about the...

200
00:14:48,253 --> 00:14:50,828
...about the silver dollar.
-Forget that.

201
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,915
What did you tell him about this?
-Nothing!

202
00:14:56,455 --> 00:14:58,201
Nothing much, really.

203
00:14:59,044 --> 00:15:01,755
Vince!
-What did you tell him, Kelly?

204
00:15:01,815 --> 00:15:03,185
Really, Vince...

205
00:15:03,381 --> 00:15:04,931
Nothing important.

206
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:06,757
Just...

207
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:08,970
a little of this and...

208
00:15:09,527 --> 00:15:11,304
that about the...

209
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,532
about the slot machines and...

210
00:15:14,315 --> 00:15:16,333
and the take. But, I...

211
00:15:16,787 --> 00:15:18,564
I phonied the figures.

212
00:15:19,403 --> 00:15:22,550
Honest I did.
-These figures aren't phoney.

213
00:15:22,836 --> 00:15:24,447
Where'd you get 'em?

214
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,684
Snatched them out of your safe, Vince.

215
00:15:31,219 --> 00:15:33,192
Williams is waiting for 'em.

216
00:15:33,535 --> 00:15:37,359
He was going to bundle me out of town,
bring me back for the trial.

217
00:15:38,696 --> 00:15:42,083
But, I was gonna duck.
They never would of found me.

218
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,480
That's the truth, Vince!

219
00:15:54,771 --> 00:15:56,021
Hello.

220
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:58,264
Hello, Nina.

221
00:16:02,956 --> 00:16:05,242
You sure it's him?
-I was with him!

222
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:08,524
First I saw him outside police
headquarters talking to Joe Williams,

223
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:10,466
then I drove him to the Cortez.

224
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:14,362
He cked in under the name
of Eddie Rice, room 304.

225
00:16:14,422 --> 00:16:15,552
Thanks.

226
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,164
You still want to take that trip, Kelly?

227
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:41,560
You don't have to worry about me, Vince.

228
00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:43,028
Don.

229
00:16:44,194 --> 00:16:45,820
Big mouth Kelly.

230
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:48,832
You think what he's got
may be contagious?

231
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,563
Very...catchy.

232
00:16:51,562 --> 00:16:54,648
What's your opinion, Don?
-Very, definitely.

233
00:16:56,621 --> 00:16:58,283
What can I do?

234
00:16:59,322 --> 00:17:01,686
The consultation's in agreement.

235
00:17:04,595 --> 00:17:05,769
Kelly!

236
00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:07,380
You're dead!

237
00:17:09,097 --> 00:17:10,527
Oh, and Kelly...

238
00:17:10,774 --> 00:17:14,749
When you get to where you're going,
have 'em give you a nice, even burn.

239
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:17,579
Don't let them just fry you on one side.

240
00:18:01,054 --> 00:18:05,210
I'm sorry to bother you again, but..
has there been any sign of the girl yet?

241
00:18:07,876 --> 00:18:09,051
Thanks.

242
00:18:40,394 --> 00:18:42,743
Don't you believe in knocking on doors?

243
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:45,814
Who are you? What do you want?

244
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:02,661
So, that's where you've been hold up...

245
00:19:02,932 --> 00:19:04,498
Eddie Rice!

246
00:19:05,181 --> 00:19:08,990
No wonder I couldn't get a line on you.
Are you back sightseeing?

247
00:19:09,378 --> 00:19:10,854
Mr Rice?

248
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:15,326
This supposed to be a free country?

249
00:19:15,684 --> 00:19:17,250
Free town?

250
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,951
Open to anyone?

251
00:19:19,011 --> 00:19:20,366
Not with me in it.

252
00:19:20,635 --> 00:19:23,240
You didn't waste much time
picking up with the cops.

253
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,395
Why should it worry you about
me talking to Williams?

254
00:19:27,455 --> 00:19:29,274
You've got me confused, Eddie.

255
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:33,460
Only a sucker would walk back in
town after the deal you pulled.

256
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,979
Some things a fella has to...

257
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:39,102
find out for himself.

258
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,948
Not about you and me.

259
00:19:50,768 --> 00:19:53,283
I've been saving this for five years.

260
00:19:54,021 --> 00:19:57,378
Everyone in life has his bible,
this is mine.

261
00:19:58,978 --> 00:20:03,661
I take it out and read it every day. I read
it to remind me of a guy I grew up with.

262
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:05,648
Got shoved around with.

263
00:20:06,277 --> 00:20:08,566
We used to take a lot of raps together.

264
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:13,143
Some people would call a guy
like that a...a loyal friend.

265
00:20:13,968 --> 00:20:15,353
He was.

266
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:22,050
Until he turned into a dirty stool pigeon,
and let me take the rap for him!

267
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:40,070
Eddie...

268
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,811
Riccardi?

269
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:47,105
My good friend who sold me out
to a cop named Joe Williams!

270
00:20:58,268 --> 00:21:00,541
Don't mess up his face too much.

271
00:21:03,876 --> 00:21:05,909
I ought to kill you, Eddie.

272
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:08,709
But, you're not worth taking
another rap for!

273
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:11,058
In 24 hours...disappear!

274
00:21:11,935 --> 00:21:15,006
Otherwise, I might be tempted
to change my mind!

275
00:21:15,624 --> 00:21:17,205
Give him some air!

276
00:22:11,865 --> 00:22:14,153
<i>Why didn't the girl come back?</i>

277
00:22:15,523 --> 00:22:17,812
<i>What did she know about me?</i>

278
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,808
<i>Why did she bring me here?</i>

279
00:22:21,847 --> 00:22:23,111
<i>Vince...</i>

280
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,123
<i>Why didn't Vince kill me?</i>

281
00:22:27,402 --> 00:22:29,450
<i>Maybe I deserved it.</i>

282
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:33,140
<i>Maybe Dr Kemble ought to know?</i>

283
00:22:34,224 --> 00:22:36,051
<i>I better tell him.</i>

284
00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:39,033
<i>I better call him.</i>

285
00:22:40,328 --> 00:22:41,908
<i>I better...</i>

286
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:45,879
Hello.

287
00:22:46,391 --> 00:22:50,456
I want to put through a call, person
to person. Dr Kemble...

288
00:22:50,652 --> 00:22:53,392
Letterman Genral Hospital,
San Francisco.

289
00:22:54,435 --> 00:22:56,091
K-E-M-B-L-E

290
00:22:57,411 --> 00:22:58,736
Thank you.

291
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:15,961
Hello, Dr Kemble?

292
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,812
When do you expect him back?

293
00:23:19,219 --> 00:23:20,920
Not till tomorrow?

294
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:24,500
Never mind, I'll see him personally.

295
00:24:15,503 --> 00:24:18,780
Forget about Union Station.
Take me to 7 Braxton Avenue.

296
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,476
Wait for me.

297
00:24:51,762 --> 00:24:53,961
Thanks a lot Lou, for driving me home.

298
00:24:54,021 --> 00:24:57,393
Just a minute, darling.
I'll walk to the door with you.

299
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:02,378
It's early, Nina. A little drink for
a nightcap won't hurt you.

300
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:04,456
That's what you think.

301
00:25:04,516 --> 00:25:07,825
You could make me forget that
thousand I dropped tonight, Nina.

302
00:25:07,885 --> 00:25:11,182
I can forget a lot of things, Lou.
You, for instance.

303
00:25:11,242 --> 00:25:13,633
Good night.
-Just a minute, baby.

304
00:25:13,693 --> 00:25:16,328
I'd like a little receipt
for that grand.

305
00:25:19,246 --> 00:25:20,827
That's better.

306
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,539
That's your receipt. Good night.

307
00:25:45,117 --> 00:25:46,758
Now listen...

308
00:25:50,045 --> 00:25:51,461
Go ahead.

309
00:25:51,521 --> 00:25:53,237
Take a good look.

310
00:25:53,629 --> 00:25:58,055
If you came to tell me how Vince welcomed
you back, you've said it. So, goodbye!

311
00:25:58,673 --> 00:26:02,272
I want to know what you had
to do with me...in my life.

312
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,057
And this.

313
00:26:10,473 --> 00:26:12,160
December the 24th,

314
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,801
1943.

315
00:26:14,162 --> 00:26:16,120
Ah, that was a lovely Christmas.

316
00:26:16,903 --> 00:26:19,041
One I'll never forget.

317
00:26:24,136 --> 00:26:26,380
Only one of your presents!

318
00:26:29,297 --> 00:26:33,664
Sure, I told Vince Alexander
you're back. I work for him.

319
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,946
This clipping...

320
00:26:40,955 --> 00:26:45,366
Why couldn't you testify at the trial?
-Oh, no routines, I've heard them all.

321
00:26:48,454 --> 00:26:51,436
Listen to me!
I'm just out of an army hospital

322
00:26:51,496 --> 00:26:54,507
with a piece of steel in my head
and no memory to go with it.

323
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:57,756
I'm here to find out about myself and
I'm getting answers the hard way!

324
00:26:57,816 --> 00:27:00,677
I don't know you, Vince Alexander...

325
00:27:00,737 --> 00:27:05,055
or anybody called Eddie Riccardi!
All I know is one person, Eddie Rice! Me!

326
00:27:07,178 --> 00:27:09,391
You're the last person I can turn to.

327
00:27:10,472 --> 00:27:12,263
Please believe me.

328
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:14,115
Help me.

329
00:27:16,584 --> 00:27:19,039
That's a very touching speech.

330
00:27:21,477 --> 00:27:23,901
You lost your memory.

331
00:27:24,564 --> 00:27:28,298
You don't know why I couldn't
testify at the trial.

332
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:32,067
You've forgotten how you used me to
make sure Vince would go to prison

333
00:27:32,127 --> 00:27:33,829
so you'd be set free.

334
00:27:33,889 --> 00:27:37,966
But, if you're back to your old tricks
again I've got sad news for you,

335
00:27:38,026 --> 00:27:40,752
I tore up your raincheck
three years ago.

336
00:27:43,494 --> 00:27:45,587
I'm not your wife anymore.

337
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,090
Now to the station?
-Back to the hotel.

338
00:28:47,065 --> 00:28:49,579
You act like a cop that just
lost a conviction?

339
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:52,877
Maybe I have, take a look at these.
Fresh out of the photo lab.

340
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:56,808
Sharks don't talk, the
fingerprints spell Kelly.

341
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:59,413
The Coroner said he was dead two
hours before he hit the water.

342
00:28:59,473 --> 00:29:01,807
Too bad. With the information
Kelly had for us

343
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:04,186
we could have put Vince
away for a long stretch.

344
00:29:05,335 --> 00:29:07,066
What's eating you, Joe?

345
00:29:07,563 --> 00:29:09,295
I was a smart cop.

346
00:29:09,355 --> 00:29:12,712
I put Petey away to get him off of
Kelly's tail, and this is what happens.

347
00:29:12,772 --> 00:29:14,594
I feel like I killed Kelly.

348
00:29:14,654 --> 00:29:16,897
Riccardi...think he's tied up in it?

349
00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:19,909
Walking back into town that day
could tie him up in anything.

350
00:29:20,237 --> 00:29:22,706
Is the case my baby?
-All yours.

351
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:26,301
Now what?

352
00:29:26,361 --> 00:29:28,936
I figure we shouldn't keep
it a secret from Vince.

353
00:29:40,844 --> 00:29:43,087
Only six days in the week now, huh?

354
00:29:43,455 --> 00:29:46,557
How do you like that, the card
must have fell out.

355
00:29:46,617 --> 00:29:48,604
It was there yesterday. Nick...

356
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:50,125
Who's Jane Doe?

357
00:29:50,185 --> 00:29:52,817
Please, Lieutenant. I don't look
at their birth certificate.

358
00:29:52,877 --> 00:29:55,075
Lots of people don't use
their right names.

359
00:29:55,135 --> 00:29:59,002
With me, a buck is a buck.
I don't ask questions.

360
00:29:59,318 --> 00:30:02,435
Before I'm through, Nick...
you'll be answering a few.

361
00:30:08,026 --> 00:30:12,377
It's gettin' so you can't tail a guy anymore
without having the cops jump on ya.

362
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:14,666
This town's goin' to the dogs.

363
00:30:14,981 --> 00:30:18,143
Samson and me...
-Petey! Get that cat off the desk!

364
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:22,133
I was just saying, Samson and
me could stand a vacation.

365
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:25,340
You want us to blow town?
-That's just what I don't want.

366
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,047
Coke will set you up, and stay quiet!

367
00:30:28,107 --> 00:30:30,667
Well, sure Vince, sure.
Anything you say.

368
00:31:05,567 --> 00:31:06,922
Hello, Danny.

369
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,327
Come in. Come in, Joe.

370
00:31:18,674 --> 00:31:22,543
Pull up a chair and rest your feet.
I hear you've had a busy day.

371
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:29,099
I figured you would.
I was saving you for last.

372
00:31:30,183 --> 00:31:31,644
Should I...

373
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,993
relax or call in my lawyer?

374
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,698
That depends on how nervous you are.

375
00:31:36,758 --> 00:31:39,529
I was always thought nervous
guys bit their nails?

376
00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:41,095
Now, let me see...

377
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:44,675
Nick was a little bit hazy about
who Jane Doe was.

378
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:47,144
I thought you might be able to tell me.

379
00:31:47,336 --> 00:31:49,113
Never heard of the girl.

380
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:50,634
Then there's Petey.

381
00:31:50,694 --> 00:31:54,654
And how certain people got know where
and just when to bail him out.

382
00:31:54,714 --> 00:31:57,014
Now...nobody knows anything.

383
00:31:57,421 --> 00:31:58,912
But, we'll find him.

384
00:31:59,273 --> 00:32:01,863
We;ve got all exits out of town plugged.

385
00:32:03,697 --> 00:32:06,483
And I got a hunch he'll
be real cooperative.

386
00:32:06,769 --> 00:32:08,063
You see...

387
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,698
I don't think he knows
anything about this.

388
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:12,249
Kelly.

389
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:15,162
He's gone and gotten himself killed.

390
00:32:15,915 --> 00:32:17,571
Just like Kelly...

391
00:32:17,842 --> 00:32:19,920
You never know what he'll do next.

392
00:32:20,191 --> 00:32:21,983
That goes for a lot of guys.

393
00:32:22,449 --> 00:32:23,910
Take you and...

394
00:32:24,482 --> 00:32:26,529
Then again, take Eddie Riccardi...

395
00:32:26,589 --> 00:32:29,962
You boys forgive and forget,
and back in business again.

396
00:32:31,037 --> 00:32:34,485
You and Riccardi got a lot in common,
why don't you ask him?

397
00:32:34,545 --> 00:32:36,352
At the moment, you're number one.

398
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:40,281
And, it won't be any...manslaughter
charge and out in two years.

399
00:32:41,076 --> 00:32:43,048
I put you away this time...

400
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:44,840
it'll be for keeps.

401
00:32:47,035 --> 00:32:50,031
You got all the answers figured
out, haven't you?

402
00:32:50,091 --> 00:32:52,636
I might have, sooner than you think.

403
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:55,479
So sorry!

404
00:33:35,693 --> 00:33:39,292
Me, I never had a complaint.
You call my old boss.

405
00:33:39,352 --> 00:33:42,115
He'll tell you my bringing in 500
a night at the gambling tables

406
00:33:42,175 --> 00:33:44,344
was a small bag of tell.

407
00:33:45,169 --> 00:33:48,993
Oh, Mr Alexander! I just came in looking
for a job and I was telling Ms Martin...

408
00:33:49,053 --> 00:33:50,378
Get rid of her.

409
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,238
Vince, we need some new talent...
-Okay! Okay! Come back at eight tonight.

410
00:33:55,298 --> 00:33:58,324
She'll tell you what to do.
-Oh, gee! Thanks!

411
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:03,899
You know Eddie's still in town?

412
00:34:05,013 --> 00:34:06,172
Yes.

413
00:34:06,353 --> 00:34:08,024
Been around to see you?

414
00:34:09,667 --> 00:34:10,796
When?

415
00:34:11,534 --> 00:34:13,266
Late last night.

416
00:34:14,184 --> 00:34:16,548
Did he tell ya I gave him
24 hours to get out?

417
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,249
No.

418
00:34:19,872 --> 00:34:22,793
Well, I changed my mind.
I want him to stay.

419
00:34:23,049 --> 00:34:25,142
I want you to make sure he does stay.

420
00:34:26,876 --> 00:34:29,827
My job's to work the tables
for you here, Vince, and...

421
00:34:30,324 --> 00:34:34,961
I don't even mind setups like the one with
Petey or...other deals like that, but...

422
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:37,613
Vince...

423
00:34:38,336 --> 00:34:40,534
Stay out of my personal life!

424
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,311
Listen you...

425
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,041
When Eddie dropped you, who picked
you up and gave you your health?

426
00:34:46,101 --> 00:34:49,053
Who gave you your job?
Everything you got?

427
00:34:49,459 --> 00:34:51,206
Vince Alexander!

428
00:34:52,806 --> 00:34:54,538
I won't do it, Vince.

429
00:34:54,598 --> 00:34:55,923
Forget Eddie.

430
00:34:55,983 --> 00:34:57,639
When I get through with him.

431
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,717
But, now you're gonna meet him.

432
00:35:00,715 --> 00:35:03,440
And, I want you to make sure
he does stay in town.

433
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,566
What'll it be?

434
00:35:35,626 --> 00:35:37,854
Did five years make you
forget that easily?

435
00:35:37,914 --> 00:35:41,016
I told you...in five years you
can forget a lot of things.

436
00:35:41,076 --> 00:35:43,064
Something for the lady?
-Rob Roy, please.

437
00:35:43,124 --> 00:35:44,491
The same.

438
00:35:48,131 --> 00:35:50,932
What made you change your mind
about seeing me again?

439
00:35:54,897 --> 00:35:58,210
You know, finding out I was married
to you kind of threw me.

440
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:02,169
It was even something the boys at
the hospital used to rib me about.

441
00:36:02,564 --> 00:36:05,605
They had me fixed up with a
wife and four or five kids.

442
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,881
They didn't know how close the
gag came to being true.

443
00:36:11,474 --> 00:36:13,672
You still don't believe me, do you?

444
00:36:21,056 --> 00:36:25,236
Maybe this'll convince you it was Eddie
Rice that rang your doorbell last night.

445
00:36:26,537 --> 00:36:29,909
Call Dr Kemble at Letterman's
Hospital in San Francisco.

446
00:36:31,007 --> 00:36:33,025
He'll tell you the whole story.

447
00:36:38,141 --> 00:36:39,767
Tha cigarette case...

448
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,323
Doesn't it mean anything to you?

449
00:36:47,468 --> 00:36:48,868
Should it?

450
00:36:54,926 --> 00:36:57,350
Suppose I did believe you, then what?

451
00:36:59,488 --> 00:37:03,569
Then, I'd try and make you forget that
Eddie Riccardi was ever in your life.

452
00:37:04,476 --> 00:37:06,403
You think you can do that?

453
00:37:07,216 --> 00:37:08,737
Eddie Rice can.

454
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:22,570
Eddie, leave town.

455
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:27,228
Now you're talking like Vince.
-Maybe I was yesterday.

456
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:30,492
Don't ask me why, but go.
-Nina, I don't frighten easily.

457
00:37:30,552 --> 00:37:33,353
You can take that message back to Vince.
Tell him I'm staying!

458
00:37:33,413 --> 00:37:36,816
That's what he wants you to do. That's
why I'm here, to keep you from leaving.

459
00:37:36,876 --> 00:37:38,740
I'd hate to disappoint him then.

460
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,895
Eddie, don't be stubborn, I know Vince.
He doesn't do anything without a reason.

461
00:37:43,964 --> 00:37:45,530
Neither do I.

462
00:37:47,802 --> 00:37:52,590
Stay then! Get yourself beaten up again,
or killed. Do anything you want.

463
00:38:35,782 --> 00:38:38,267
Riccardi.
-Very interesting.

464
00:38:47,205 --> 00:38:48,936
Scotch over water.

465
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:53,136
Lose something, Charlie?

466
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,406
Tell Nina Martin, Eddie wants to see her.
-Eddie who?

467
00:38:59,658 --> 00:39:01,103
Just Eddie.

468
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,060
Wait here.

469
00:39:11,467 --> 00:39:12,943
What'll I need?

470
00:39:13,003 --> 00:39:15,653
A thousand might bring you luck.
-A thousand?

471
00:39:15,894 --> 00:39:17,475
Give me a thousand.

472
00:39:24,925 --> 00:39:27,891
A character called Eddie's outside,
wants to see you.

473
00:39:27,951 --> 00:39:29,412
Eddie here?

474
00:39:29,788 --> 00:39:31,204
Get rid of him!

475
00:39:31,425 --> 00:39:33,668
That's not what Vince had in mind.

476
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,972
All right, come on.

477
00:39:53,097 --> 00:39:54,663
6...9...12!

478
00:39:54,919 --> 00:39:56,636
All bets down.

479
00:40:00,679 --> 00:40:04,549
It's a nice layout. Vince ought to be
able to pick up some fast money.

480
00:40:04,609 --> 00:40:07,063
You're crazy to come walking in here.

481
00:40:07,123 --> 00:40:09,273
Maybe I'm just hard to convince.

482
00:40:10,477 --> 00:40:12,374
My dressing room is back there.

483
00:40:13,925 --> 00:40:16,590
I'll be back before the
wheel stops turning.

484
00:40:34,853 --> 00:40:35,973
Yeah?

485
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:38,939
Okay, thanks.

486
00:40:43,645 --> 00:40:45,813
So, she wanted to get rid of him.

487
00:40:47,179 --> 00:40:50,040
I wonder if that dame is trying
to pull a double cross.

488
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,129
Get down to the Golden Horn and pick up
Eddie Riccardi, you'll find him with Nina.

489
00:40:55,189 --> 00:40:56,270
Just him?

490
00:40:56,571 --> 00:40:57,746
Just him.

491
00:40:58,197 --> 00:41:00,110
I'll get around to her later.

492
00:41:03,747 --> 00:41:05,569
I started to leave...

493
00:41:05,794 --> 00:41:08,309
but I kept thinking about
everything you told me.

494
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,230
If I'd of left I'd been all the
things you said I was.

495
00:41:11,727 --> 00:41:13,232
So, I'm staying.

496
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,505
And, I'm taking you out of here.

497
00:41:18,498 --> 00:41:19,673
Nina.

498
00:41:21,043 --> 00:41:23,436
We could have a decent life together.

499
00:41:26,553 --> 00:41:28,465
You got it all figured out.

500
00:41:31,452 --> 00:41:36,089
Well, you're not taking me anywhere.
You pushed me into this life and I like it.

501
00:41:36,481 --> 00:41:41,374
I'm top bait around here steering nice,
fat, pigeons to the gambling table.

502
00:41:41,434 --> 00:41:46,174
I'm one of Vince's kind now and I'm keeping
my life and my job just the way they are.

503
00:41:46,234 --> 00:41:48,026
No matter what I have to do!

504
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,934
Come on.

505
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,144
Thanks.

506
00:42:10,804 --> 00:42:13,469
Now, how about some champagne?

507
00:42:14,389 --> 00:42:17,581
Excuse me for a minute, honey.
I forgot I got to call my wife.

508
00:42:32,729 --> 00:42:35,048
Williams, Homicide.
Yeah, Barnes.

509
00:42:36,509 --> 00:42:37,653
Yeah!

510
00:42:38,586 --> 00:42:39,881
Thanks a lot!

511
00:42:40,377 --> 00:42:41,898
What's exciting?

512
00:42:50,385 --> 00:42:54,646
I said, what's exciting? Or, don't
you want to wake me up?

513
00:42:55,138 --> 00:42:59,113
Barnes casing the Golden Horn for vice
intel, tells me Riccardi just walked in.

514
00:42:59,805 --> 00:43:01,266
Trouble maybe?

515
00:43:01,717 --> 00:43:04,924
I could think of plenty of reasons why
there might be for Eddie Rice.

516
00:43:05,478 --> 00:43:07,300
You'll hear from me later.

517
00:43:25,961 --> 00:43:28,189
How you coming with that
Kelly report, Ben?

518
00:43:28,249 --> 00:43:30,945
Just finishing up for you.
-Okay, I'll wait.

519
00:43:33,515 --> 00:43:36,586
Somebody must've believed in that
old gag about an apple a day.

520
00:43:36,646 --> 00:43:40,513
Yeah, but they didn't know it would pin
a murder on them. -Quite an appetite.

521
00:43:40,573 --> 00:43:43,253
Psychological, it creates
a false hunger.

522
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:50,156
Well, here you are, Joe.
I can go home now.

523
00:43:50,216 --> 00:43:53,454
Thanks a lot, Ben. See you tomorrow.
-Okay, see ya tomorrow.

524
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:07,778
Yeah?

525
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:10,970
I'm interested in Eddie Riccardi,
not in what's going on in there.

526
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:13,680
We don't know from Riccardi.
-I do, open up.

527
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:18,240
Place your bets, folks. Place your
bets. Bet high/low...odd or even.

528
00:44:38,711 --> 00:44:39,795
Yes?

529
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:43,438
Miss Martin? Williams, Homicide.
May I come in please?

530
00:44:43,732 --> 00:44:44,982
Come in.

531
00:44:47,432 --> 00:44:50,820
Eddie was just picked up by Danny.
-Where'd he take him?

532
00:44:52,557 --> 00:44:54,424
You'll hear from me later.

533
00:45:14,826 --> 00:45:16,377
You know, Williams?

534
00:45:17,054 --> 00:45:19,524
I'm not used to cops with insomnia.

535
00:45:20,201 --> 00:45:22,791
What's on your mind?
-It won't take long.

536
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:25,960
Danny picked up Eddie Riccardi.
Where are they?

537
00:45:27,537 --> 00:45:29,329
You're in an awful rut.

538
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,497
Always asking questions.

539
00:45:31,557 --> 00:45:33,846
All right...let's start over.

540
00:45:34,581 --> 00:45:37,306
Eddie was at the Golden Horn
with Nina Martin.

541
00:45:37,366 --> 00:45:39,685
Suddenly, he wasn't there anymore.

542
00:45:40,208 --> 00:45:41,368
So...

543
00:45:41,578 --> 00:45:44,018
So...I don't mind waiting.

544
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:48,053
While we kill a little time...

545
00:45:49,429 --> 00:45:51,176
This might interest you.

546
00:46:01,803 --> 00:46:05,733
And, after we pick up Riccardi...
we're going down to police headquarters.

547
00:46:06,034 --> 00:46:08,579
You're gonna have a manicure...on me.

548
00:46:10,294 --> 00:46:13,380
You know, you're gonna look awful
silly when I get through with you.

549
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,819
If I'm wrong...I'll apologize.

550
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:23,264
Say hello, nothing more.

551
00:46:25,733 --> 00:46:26,862
Hello.

552
00:46:27,674 --> 00:46:31,408
Vince, we're at the shop. Do we
stay or bring Riccardi up there?

553
00:46:32,507 --> 00:46:34,238
Tell him you'll be down.

554
00:46:52,464 --> 00:46:53,699
Okay, Coke...

555
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,385
<i>Bring him up here.</i>

556
00:47:28,724 --> 00:47:30,530
What do you want now?

557
00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:44,605
Just when he was coming up
in the department.

558
00:49:14,591 --> 00:49:15,886
Car 9-4

559
00:49:15,946 --> 00:49:17,813
9-4 to Control-4.

560
00:49:17,873 --> 00:49:20,252
<i>Clear Frequency-4, this is an emergency.</i>

561
00:49:20,312 --> 00:49:23,126
Control-4 to 94, go ahead.

562
00:49:23,186 --> 00:49:25,099
<i>Car 94 to Control-4</i>

563
00:49:25,159 --> 00:49:29,209
<i>Notify the Homicide Bureau, we have found
the body of Lt Williams in his car.</i>

564
00:49:29,269 --> 00:49:31,133
At Sepulveda and Sunset.

565
00:50:17,423 --> 00:50:18,763
Give you a lift, son?

566
00:50:18,823 --> 00:50:21,485
Thanks, I had a little accident
back up a side road.

567
00:50:21,545 --> 00:50:24,556
I have to go to town, get a tow car.
-Anybody killed?

568
00:50:27,016 --> 00:50:29,561
No luck at all tonight.
Hop in.

569
00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:42,090
Bet you thought I wouldn't stop
to pick you up, didn't you?

570
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:43,638
I didn't know.

571
00:50:43,698 --> 00:50:45,113
It's late.
-See...

572
00:50:45,173 --> 00:50:49,130
That's why I fooled you. Have me orders.
Pick up anybody, anytime.

573
00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:51,870
Green Acres Morticians policy.

574
00:50:52,094 --> 00:50:54,698
Live today...maybe a customer tomorrow.

575
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,400
Pays off too.

576
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:59,848
Most people remember the nice things
you do for them while they're living.

577
00:50:59,908 --> 00:51:03,864
We sure don't get any complaints about our
service from them after they're dead.

578
00:51:03,924 --> 00:51:05,927
Their family, that is.

579
00:51:07,423 --> 00:51:09,441
That accident hurt you any?

580
00:51:10,992 --> 00:51:13,069
Got a match?
-Sure do.

581
00:51:19,645 --> 00:51:21,813
Police, ambulance and everything.

582
00:51:22,114 --> 00:51:24,312
I wonder if I'm losing any customers?

583
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:40,902
Finished with Joe's stuff yet?
-Still working on it.

584
00:51:43,326 --> 00:51:44,816
It's too bad...

585
00:51:45,434 --> 00:51:48,460
Joe's wife sure liked him
in that suit too.

586
00:52:13,311 --> 00:52:16,021
Any line on Riccardi yet?
-Nothing, Captain.

587
00:52:16,081 --> 00:52:19,710
Keep trying, he's the last one who
might of seen Joe. -Okay.

588
00:52:20,197 --> 00:52:21,718
Eddie Riccardi.

589
00:52:24,187 --> 00:52:26,445
Guess Williams was right after all.

590
00:52:26,701 --> 00:52:28,538
Riccardi or Rice.

591
00:52:28,826 --> 00:52:32,530
A Silver Star and a dumb look doesn't
change a no good heel.

592
00:52:33,147 --> 00:52:36,173
Attention all units!
Attention all units!

593
00:52:36,233 --> 00:52:40,175
Be on the lookout for the following
<i>described suspect, wanted for murder:</i>

594
00:52:40,551 --> 00:52:43,322
<i>Eddie Riccardi, alias Eddie Rice,</i>

595
00:52:43,589 --> 00:52:46,164
<i>White male, American,</i>

596
00:52:46,224 --> 00:52:49,341
<i>Age 33, 6 foot 2.</i>

597
00:52:49,729 --> 00:52:51,506
<i>190 lbs...</i>

598
00:52:51,957 --> 00:52:53,312
<i>Dark brown...</i>

599
00:52:53,659 --> 00:52:55,944
You phone the cops and do 'em a favor,

600
00:52:56,004 --> 00:53:00,024
where to find a dead cop and the guy
that did it, and what happens...

601
00:53:05,972 --> 00:53:08,035
The first stop is Nina Martin's.

602
00:53:08,276 --> 00:53:10,474
I want Eddie before the cops get him.

603
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:12,913
Then they can have him for a present.

604
00:53:14,334 --> 00:53:15,915
And alive!

605
00:53:32,066 --> 00:53:33,843
Eddie!
-Shut up!

606
00:53:34,168 --> 00:53:36,065
Get those lights out!

607
00:53:37,285 --> 00:53:39,152
Eddie, what happened?

608
00:53:40,533 --> 00:53:43,951
You certainly did a neat job
of tying me into a murder.

609
00:53:44,011 --> 00:53:46,089
Joe Williams was killed tonight.

610
00:53:46,149 --> 00:53:47,901
You?
-I don't know.

611
00:53:47,961 --> 00:53:51,138
The last thing I remember was being slugged
over the head at Vince Alexander's.

612
00:53:51,198 --> 00:53:53,713
I know you think that...
-I haven't got time to think!

613
00:53:53,773 --> 00:53:57,811
All I want is a few bucks, your car and
you in my sight till I get out of here!

614
00:53:57,871 --> 00:53:59,874
Eddie, you've got to believe me!

615
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,335
Believe?

616
00:54:01,656 --> 00:54:03,508
Like you believed me?

617
00:54:03,885 --> 00:54:05,661
Give me the keys!

618
00:54:10,271 --> 00:54:14,017
Eddie! This is why I turned on you
tonight, to get you away from Vince.

619
00:54:14,077 --> 00:54:16,992
The keys are in the car, you go,
I'll try to stall them off.

620
00:54:17,224 --> 00:54:19,468
And get a bullet in the back of my head?

621
00:54:19,528 --> 00:54:22,404
Oh, Eddie! You've got to trust me,
it's your only chance.

622
00:54:24,815 --> 00:54:26,091
Quick!

623
00:54:26,444 --> 00:54:28,043
The garage.

624
00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:29,188
This is where you get out. -Go to the
police, Eddie. Before it's too late.

625
00:55:29,248 --> 00:55:32,400
With my fingerprints all over the
gun and all over Williams car?

626
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:35,257
I wouldn't last long enough to walk
to the nearest police station.

627
00:55:35,317 --> 00:55:38,133
If I did what could I tell them?
Now out!

628
00:55:38,788 --> 00:55:41,737
You want me to go home and wait
for Vince to come back again?

629
00:55:41,797 --> 00:55:45,800
That's something Eddie Riccardo would
tell me to do, not Eddie Rice.

630
00:55:49,139 --> 00:55:50,606
All right.

631
00:56:06,538 --> 00:56:07,668
Stop.

632
00:56:11,312 --> 00:56:13,997
Keep your lights off and
the motor running.

633
00:56:57,233 --> 00:56:59,889
Well, now you've got a gun! What next?

634
00:57:01,213 --> 00:57:04,044
I didn't ask for any killings,
so I'm in the middle.

635
00:57:04,528 --> 00:57:07,711
But, I'm not going to be a clay
pigeon for Vince Alexander.

636
00:57:08,308 --> 00:57:10,513
You can't prove anything dead.

637
00:57:10,573 --> 00:57:14,597
That would make Vince very happy,
something I wouldn't want to let happen.

638
00:57:15,047 --> 00:57:18,758
Is there any place we could go, someone
you can trust to put us up for the night?

639
00:57:18,818 --> 00:57:20,299
I need time.

640
00:57:21,747 --> 00:57:23,404
Maybe there is.

641
00:57:23,464 --> 00:57:25,443
It's a long chance, but...

642
00:57:28,917 --> 00:57:31,763
You don't think you're going to
get away with this, do you?

643
00:57:32,276 --> 00:57:34,477
We're staying here till tomorrow.

644
00:57:42,766 --> 00:57:46,004
Stay away from that phone!
If it rings, let it keep ringing!

645
00:57:46,064 --> 00:57:48,953
Get rid of anybody who comes to
the door, I'll be right behind you

646
00:57:49,013 --> 00:57:50,845
in case you give the wrong answers.

647
00:57:55,517 --> 00:57:58,539
What about the girl's place?
-There and gone.

648
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:02,705
Get a teletype out on her car immediately,
have it re-broadcast every half hour.

649
00:58:08,211 --> 00:58:10,661
I want roadblocks at all these points.

650
00:58:10,721 --> 00:58:12,705
I want the airport, the railroad station,

651
00:58:12,765 --> 00:58:15,536
all the bus terminals put
under a 24 surveillance.

652
00:58:15,596 --> 00:58:18,001
I want every hotel and
flophouse notified.

653
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:20,818
They're in this town somewhere
and they're not getting out.

654
00:58:21,019 --> 00:58:22,354
One other thing...

655
00:58:22,414 --> 00:58:26,887
We picked up Riccardi's fingerprints on
that gun shop. He's got a gun now.

656
00:58:27,294 --> 00:58:29,421
Don't give him a chance to use it!

657
00:58:29,481 --> 00:58:31,284
All right, start moving.

658
00:58:31,344 --> 00:58:33,908
<i>The police tightened its dragnet
about the city today.</i>

659
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:36,988
<i>Riccardi escaped just as the police
were ready to close in on him</i>

660
00:58:37,048 --> 00:58:39,197
<i>after they received an
anonymous phone call</i>

661
00:58:39,257 --> 00:58:42,292
<i>which led them to discover the murdered
body of one of their men today.</i>

662
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,067
<i>Every available man...</i>

663
00:58:47,714 --> 00:58:49,958
We'll wait till it's dark
and get out of here.

664
00:58:50,018 --> 00:58:52,423
You couldn't arrange to
drop dead before then?

665
00:58:52,483 --> 00:58:55,606
Hazel, you've got to believe us.
Eddie didn't do it!

666
00:58:55,897 --> 00:58:57,936
He should still drop dead.

667
00:58:58,269 --> 00:58:59,604
Twice.

668
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:13,477
Coke!

669
01:00:36,274 --> 01:00:38,401
Get me a couple of clean towels.

670
01:00:42,231 --> 01:00:43,771
It's pretty bad.

671
01:00:44,739 --> 01:00:49,052
I'll have you out of here in a minute,
we'll find a doctor. -Go to the police.

672
01:00:49,497 --> 01:00:51,448
Eddie, go to the police.

673
01:00:53,848 --> 01:00:55,961
Your car in the garage?
-Yes.

674
01:00:56,021 --> 01:00:58,704
Where are your keys?
-In my purse.

675
01:00:58,764 --> 01:01:00,288
Take care of her.

676
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:23,843
Thanks.

677
01:01:23,903 --> 01:01:26,748
I'll have the doctor come right
in the moment he returns.

678
01:01:38,651 --> 01:01:40,602
Light me a cigarette.

679
01:02:02,498 --> 01:02:04,288
You're far away.

680
01:02:06,205 --> 01:02:07,614
How far?

681
01:02:09,418 --> 01:02:10,885
Five years.

682
01:02:11,545 --> 01:02:13,041
A lifetime.

683
01:02:14,259 --> 01:02:15,961
Beyond that, a blank.

684
01:02:17,162 --> 01:02:18,879
Me too, Eddie.

685
01:02:18,939 --> 01:02:21,270
Only, it's been a different
kind of a blank.

686
01:02:21,798 --> 01:02:24,453
It's being pushed back
to Eddie Riccardi.

687
01:02:24,937 --> 01:02:26,184
This.

688
01:02:26,811 --> 01:02:30,215
The whole past that keeps me
from being like other people.

689
01:02:30,992 --> 01:02:32,763
Now all that's left is

690
01:02:32,823 --> 01:02:36,460
wondering what it would be like if there
had only been an Eddie Rice.

691
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:41,287
If I'd of just met you
for the first time.

692
01:02:43,087 --> 01:02:45,508
Eddie Rice can have that.

693
01:02:48,248 --> 01:02:50,610
Oh, you're...good, Eddie.

694
01:02:51,681 --> 01:02:53,368
You're good.

695
01:02:54,934 --> 01:02:57,622
You've taken away the hate in me.

696
01:02:58,176 --> 01:02:59,995
Destroyed it.

697
01:03:01,946 --> 01:03:03,912
You're...good, Eddie.

698
01:03:07,874 --> 01:03:10,573
When a baby wants to be born,
hours don't matter!

699
01:03:10,633 --> 01:03:12,554
7 poundsd 7ounces...a boy.

700
01:03:12,614 --> 01:03:14,549
Doctor, her shoulder...

701
01:03:29,779 --> 01:03:31,760
I can't treat gun wounds.

702
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:34,679
She'll have to go to the police
emergency hospital.

703
01:03:34,739 --> 01:03:36,179
I don't think so.

704
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:39,260
I'm sorry, but I've got to report
this to the police.

705
01:03:39,320 --> 01:03:40,624
Doctor.

706
01:03:41,138 --> 01:03:43,191
That report to the police...

707
01:03:43,539 --> 01:03:44,918
It'll wait.

708
01:03:45,123 --> 01:03:47,368
If you want to pull that
trigger, go ahead.

709
01:03:49,535 --> 01:03:51,603
Police headquarters, please.

710
01:03:53,055 --> 01:03:56,092
Put that gun away! I said I was
going to call the police.

711
01:03:56,293 --> 01:03:57,775
Police headquarters?

712
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:00,914
This is Dr Stacey, 93 Chestnut Street.

713
01:04:01,174 --> 01:04:03,492
Send an ambulance and a squad car.

714
01:04:09,003 --> 01:04:10,602
How bad is it?

715
01:04:14,534 --> 01:04:16,118
She'll be all right.

716
01:04:18,447 --> 01:04:20,262
You'd better leave.

717
01:04:27,035 --> 01:04:30,805
Eddie, I'm scared...I'm scared...
-Take it easy, you'll be all right.

718
01:04:30,865 --> 01:04:33,341
Not for me, for you.
-Listen...

719
01:04:33,531 --> 01:04:37,507
I'm leaving you for a little while.
I've got an idea, it might work.

720
01:04:37,567 --> 01:04:39,672
Something very important.

721
01:04:40,214 --> 01:04:44,395
You knew all about me. The people
I used to know, the places I went.

722
01:04:44,699 --> 01:04:46,855
Think for me, go back five years.

723
01:04:46,915 --> 01:04:51,110
Who was there? Just one person.
Give me the answers, quick!

724
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:54,289
What you say is my only chance,
the only chance I've got.

725
01:04:54,349 --> 01:04:58,231
The only one left is...Petey.
He can't be trusted with Vince.

726
01:04:58,291 --> 01:05:01,337
Where will I find him?
-Not him, he's... -Tell me!

727
01:05:01,759 --> 01:05:04,457
Two, three places on Main Street.

728
01:05:05,198 --> 01:05:07,034
Fourth and Main...

729
01:05:07,094 --> 01:05:10,091
And after Nina ran in front of him,
Coke never had a chance.

730
01:05:10,151 --> 01:05:11,748
That Eddie sure didn't miss.

731
01:05:11,808 --> 01:05:14,345
Coke took three, went right through
his breakfast, lunch and supper.

732
01:05:14,405 --> 01:05:16,575
Anybody come around, ask any questions?

733
01:05:16,635 --> 01:05:19,900
None I couldn't answer, Vince.
-Get back down and keep him company.

734
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:22,570
But...but, the police?
-That's exactly what I want!

735
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:25,559
Tell him how Riccardi broke into your
apartment, found Coke there

736
01:05:25,619 --> 01:05:28,727
pulled his gun and fired. Now do
what I told you, just that!

737
01:05:29,035 --> 01:05:31,250
All right, Vince.
-Take her back!

738
01:05:35,048 --> 01:05:37,293
Eddie's got to find a doctor somewhere.

739
01:05:37,484 --> 01:05:39,581
And, if he does what I think, he'll...

740
01:05:39,772 --> 01:05:42,295
dump the girl...and start looking
for a hidewaway.

741
01:05:43,785 --> 01:05:44,973
Get going!

742
01:05:45,033 --> 01:05:48,039
Spread the news I got a personal
interest in Eddie Riccardi.

743
01:05:48,099 --> 01:05:50,870
I don't want anything to happen
to him...until I get there.

744
01:05:51,389 --> 01:05:53,443
Unless the cops get him first.

745
01:05:54,467 --> 01:05:57,841
You through with him, Doc?
-Yup. He was a fine specimen.

746
01:05:57,901 --> 01:06:00,041
Would have had a long life
if this hadn't happened.

747
01:06:00,101 --> 01:06:02,051
I'll send you my report in the morning.

748
01:06:05,694 --> 01:06:08,335
I'm sure you don't mind coming
downtown, Miss Downs?

749
01:06:08,395 --> 01:06:10,477
Well, I...
-I thought not.

750
01:06:12,659 --> 01:06:14,859
What'd you find?
-It was them all right.

751
01:06:14,919 --> 01:06:17,471
Riccardi left the doctor's office
about 30 minutes ago

752
01:06:17,531 --> 01:06:20,830
Notify Communications? -They're blanketing
the whole area. -The girl?

753
01:06:20,890 --> 01:06:25,608
County Jail Hospital. Still out, whether
she's playing it safe or just not talking.

754
01:06:25,668 --> 01:06:29,085
Keep Melon there, the minute she comes
out, I want to know. -Any ideas?

755
01:06:29,145 --> 01:06:31,970
Lots! We need Riccardi to
explain some of them.

756
01:06:32,157 --> 01:06:34,196
If he lives that long.

757
01:06:38,347 --> 01:06:41,120
Hello. I'm looking for Petey,
have you seen him?

758
01:06:42,691 --> 01:06:44,671
Do you know where to find him?

759
01:06:57,552 --> 01:07:00,780
<i>Nina said three or four places,
I must have hit twenty.</i>

760
01:07:01,245 --> 01:07:03,196
<i>And every answer the same.</i>

761
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:04,810
<i>No.</i>

762
01:07:05,803 --> 01:07:08,605
<i>The shake of their head,
a frightened face.</i>

763
01:07:10,111 --> 01:07:14,043
<i>They knew where I could find what I was
looking for, but they wouldn't talk.</i>

764
01:07:14,483 --> 01:07:16,141
<i>They were scared.</i>

765
01:08:08,257 --> 01:08:11,660
But, Vince! Appreciate the fact
that at least I called you.

766
01:08:11,961 --> 01:08:14,015
I let him stay, it's another rap.

767
01:08:14,075 --> 01:08:17,623
Another rap, I get life! You've
got to appreciate that!

768
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:23,296
And I'd appreciate it if you'd
tell me where to find Petey.

769
01:08:24,044 --> 01:08:25,306
Right now!

770
01:08:25,366 --> 01:08:26,758
Sure, Eddie.

771
01:08:27,096 --> 01:08:28,152
Sure.

772
01:08:34,841 --> 01:08:36,822
Ocean Boulevard and 25th.

773
01:09:43,996 --> 01:09:46,490
Who's there? Who is it?
-Eddie.

774
01:09:47,355 --> 01:09:48,910
Eddie Riccardi.

775
01:09:49,277 --> 01:09:52,886
Oh, Eddie boy. Every cop in the
city is out gunning for you!

776
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:55,403
Maybe you don't care if you live...

777
01:09:55,711 --> 01:09:57,604
I got a few more years left!

778
01:09:57,839 --> 01:09:59,526
Open the door, Petey.

779
01:10:00,083 --> 01:10:01,799
You're dead if you don't.

780
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,769
All right, Eddie.

781
01:10:12,804 --> 01:10:15,914
You didn't think I'd leave you out
there in the cold, did you Eddie?

782
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:20,550
Five years, no see! But, you sure got
a hot fire burning under you, huh?

783
01:10:21,019 --> 01:10:22,105
Yeah.

784
01:10:24,891 --> 01:10:26,900
You need a pal, a friend.

785
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:32,240
Sure, I need a friend, Petey.

786
01:10:32,483 --> 01:10:36,263
Look, old friend... Will you...will
you put that mouthpiece away?

787
01:10:36,323 --> 01:10:39,153
Somehow I...I still believe they go off!

788
01:10:39,926 --> 01:10:42,669
And, Samson my cat, you remember my cat?

789
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:46,439
He's not feeling too good again.

790
01:10:46,949 --> 01:10:49,545
You stay careful and
nothing will happen.

791
01:10:49,605 --> 01:10:53,110
Oh sure. Sure, Eddie. You're
talking to Petey, remember?

792
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:55,746
Any objections to my moving in with you?

793
01:10:56,025 --> 01:10:58,416
I'll be gone, tomorrow or the next day.

794
01:10:58,476 --> 01:11:01,771
Oh, me? Turn away practically,
my own flesh and blood?

795
01:11:03,341 --> 01:11:04,822
Relax, Eddie.

796
01:11:08,491 --> 01:11:11,308
There you are, Eddie. Nothing's
too good for you.

797
01:11:12,355 --> 01:11:16,154
How about some food, Petey?
I haven't eaten all night.

798
01:11:16,536 --> 01:11:18,370
You haven't changed a bit.

799
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:20,086
Always hungry!

800
01:11:20,146 --> 01:11:22,022
Still tied up with Vince?

801
01:11:24,002 --> 01:11:27,670
I do a little private eyeing on the side.
A job here, a job there.

802
01:11:28,007 --> 01:11:29,284
Nothing big.

803
01:11:31,150 --> 01:11:32,705
I'll telephone.

804
01:11:43,749 --> 01:11:47,358
Hello, friend? Petey! I got
a special customer.

805
01:11:47,828 --> 01:11:49,852
Yeah. Yeah, an old one.

806
01:11:50,881 --> 01:11:54,094
How about sending something over?
He's tired and hungry.

807
01:11:54,813 --> 01:11:56,778
A pot of coffee and a sandwich.

808
01:11:56,969 --> 01:11:58,011
Turkey.

809
01:11:58,266 --> 01:11:59,352
Tongue

810
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,684
Egg salad combination.

811
01:12:02,638 --> 01:12:04,442
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

812
01:12:05,543 --> 01:12:06,863
You got it.

813
01:12:12,752 --> 01:12:16,068
You see, Eddie? Everything's
just like old times.

814
01:12:16,655 --> 01:12:18,474
If you say so, Petey.

815
01:12:20,114 --> 01:12:21,948
I'm gettin' kinda sleepy.

816
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:25,308
You just make yourself at home,
food will be along pretty soon.

817
01:12:25,368 --> 01:12:28,183
Vince has gotten to be a big
man the last five years.

818
01:12:28,675 --> 01:12:31,168
I'm really gettin' pretty tired, friend.

819
01:12:31,228 --> 01:12:33,457
Why don't you bring me
up to date, Petey?

820
01:12:33,517 --> 01:12:35,247
I'm really awful tired, friend!

821
01:12:35,307 --> 01:12:37,501
How long will it take Vince to get here?

822
01:12:37,971 --> 01:12:40,861
Eddie...Eddie, you...you embarrass me.

823
01:12:41,135 --> 01:12:43,834
I'll kill you if you don't give
it to me straight, Petey!

824
01:12:43,894 --> 01:12:47,047
Eddie...Eddie, don't talk like that.
Samson's sick!

825
01:12:47,543 --> 01:12:50,403
I'm telling you, Eddie!
-What are you telling me? How long?

826
01:12:50,463 --> 01:12:53,557
Five minutes? Ten? Fifteen minutes?
Twenty minutes?

827
01:12:54,096 --> 01:12:57,015
About...about fifteen minutes, Eddie.

828
01:12:57,323 --> 01:13:00,902
Vince puts you on the spot!
He's that way with all the boys!

829
01:13:01,162 --> 01:13:04,781
Blow Eddie! Take me with you.
You and me was always friends!

830
01:13:04,841 --> 01:13:08,273
You just stay in front of me and keep your
mouth shut and you won't get into trouble.

831
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:11,265
Sure, Eddie! You got nothing
to worry about from me.

832
01:13:11,325 --> 01:13:14,361
Just stay my friend, Petey.
-Yeah, Eddie.

833
01:13:27,837 --> 01:13:29,935
You're retired, you can go home now.

834
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,601
Your friend want a ride?
-Not tonight.

835
01:13:34,995 --> 01:13:36,151
$2.80

836
01:13:36,711 --> 01:13:39,616
This will get you a thousand.
Come on, Petey.

837
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,005
Take care of Petey.

838
01:15:45,187 --> 01:15:46,434
Eddie!

839
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:48,165
Let's get out of here!

840
01:15:49,661 --> 01:15:51,158
Go ahead, Petey.

841
01:15:51,610 --> 01:15:52,974
Thanks, Eddie.

842
01:15:54,148 --> 01:15:55,615
They're coming!

843
01:18:02,988 --> 01:18:04,191
Eddie.

844
01:18:04,792 --> 01:18:06,274
Can you hear me?

845
01:18:09,079 --> 01:18:10,898
We can make a break.

846
01:18:11,558 --> 01:18:13,319
Cover for each other.

847
01:18:14,096 --> 01:18:15,739
I got a place.

848
01:18:17,148 --> 01:18:18,820
You and me, Eddie.

849
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:22,342
We'll start up again.

850
01:18:22,914 --> 01:18:25,056
Just like old times.

851
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:31,671
I got money, Eddie.

852
01:18:32,992 --> 01:18:34,327
Big money!

853
01:18:37,521 --> 01:18:39,355
Samson! Samson!

854
01:18:39,986 --> 01:18:41,159
Samson!

855
01:18:43,096 --> 01:18:44,841
Petey! Come back!

856
01:18:46,807 --> 01:18:47,908
Samson.

857
01:18:48,318 --> 01:18:50,446
Samson, baby. Samson.

858
01:19:47,773 --> 01:19:50,091
Riccardi! Alexander!

859
01:19:50,292 --> 01:19:53,813
We'll give you three minutes to come out.
We're gonna start counting.

860
01:19:54,135 --> 01:19:57,920
At the end of three minutes if you're
not out, we're coming to get you!

861
01:19:58,429 --> 01:20:00,600
This is your last chance, Eddie.

862
01:20:01,862 --> 01:20:04,121
There's just you and me left now.

863
01:20:04,181 --> 01:20:05,676
No deal, Vince.

864
01:20:06,455 --> 01:20:08,538
I know you killed Joe Williams.

865
01:20:08,978 --> 01:20:10,357
Okay...

866
01:20:11,516 --> 01:20:13,071
No deals.

867
01:21:51,795 --> 01:21:54,993
We want you, Riccardi..
Alive, Alexander!

868
01:21:55,595 --> 01:21:58,646
If you're in there and not wounded,
bring Riccardi out.

869
01:21:59,653 --> 01:22:03,761
You, Riccardi! If you're alone, come
out with your hands in the air!

870
01:22:06,712 --> 01:22:09,176
Here's when you and I part company.

871
01:22:09,396 --> 01:22:12,081
You're gonna get paid off in full.

872
01:22:41,345 --> 01:22:43,574
Thanks for bringing him out, Vince.

873
01:22:43,853 --> 01:22:47,169
Now, drop your gun.
I said drop your gun, Vince!

874
01:22:49,233 --> 01:22:51,932
Eddie will take what I
got first, Anderson!

875
01:22:54,015 --> 01:22:56,568
All police officers hold your fire!

876
01:22:57,552 --> 01:22:59,532
Don't be crazy, Alexander.

877
01:22:59,899 --> 01:23:02,774
There have been enough people killed.
Give yourself up.

878
01:23:02,834 --> 01:23:04,491
No bargains, Anderson!

879
01:23:04,551 --> 01:23:06,487
You want Riccardi alive...

880
01:23:06,547 --> 01:23:07,866
I want out!

881
01:23:07,926 --> 01:23:10,682
What guarantee have I got that
you won't kill Riccardi?

882
01:23:10,742 --> 01:23:13,250
You don't!
-Be sensible, Alexander.

883
01:23:13,979 --> 01:23:16,854
If we let you out now,
we'll get you later.

884
01:23:17,089 --> 01:23:19,040
You'll be dead before morning.

885
01:23:19,245 --> 01:23:21,930
You got 30 seconds to make
up your mind, Anderson!

886
01:23:22,688 --> 01:23:24,053
I go...

887
01:23:24,361 --> 01:23:26,415
or Riccardi gets it in the back!

888
01:23:29,595 --> 01:23:31,388
Sat down, Eddie! Don't move!

889
01:24:05,464 --> 01:24:06,711
Is he dead?

890
01:24:06,771 --> 01:24:09,234
He will be if we don't get
him to a hospital.

891
01:24:15,716 --> 01:24:19,090
That taxi driver must have really
gotten to you in a hurry.

892
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,980
He did, asking for a $1000 reward.

893
01:24:22,337 --> 01:24:26,826
And all the questions you want to ask...
I called Dr Kemble from San Francisco.

894
01:24:27,149 --> 01:24:31,242
We knew Vince killed Jow Williams,
we found his blood on Joe's clothing.

895
01:24:31,604 --> 01:24:34,435
It matched up with our
lab files, yours didn't.

896
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:37,351
And, Hazel told us the truth about Coke.

897
01:24:37,747 --> 01:24:41,254
Now, just get well. We'll finish
our business later.

898
01:24:42,217 --> 01:24:43,391
Nina...

899
01:24:43,451 --> 01:24:45,782
She's fine...in the waiting room.

900
01:25:05,063 --> 01:25:08,173
You shouldn't kiss a guy like
that when he's sick in bed.

901
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:14,254
Well, I've been waiting outside all the
time. They wouldn't tell me anything.

902
01:25:14,314 --> 01:25:15,970
I was afraid...

903
01:25:17,151 --> 01:25:18,647
It's all right.

904
01:25:19,674 --> 01:25:21,170
We'll go away.

905
01:25:21,230 --> 01:25:24,222
We'll find that...crazy world of yours.

906
01:25:25,698 --> 01:25:27,151
Sure.

907
01:25:30,408 --> 01:25:32,373
There's only one thing...

908
01:25:33,675 --> 01:25:35,494
You'll always be...

909
01:25:35,758 --> 01:25:37,298
Eddie Rice.

910
01:25:38,853 --> 01:25:40,540
For the rest of my life.

911
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:43,059
I have the doc's word for him.

912
01:25:44,673 --> 01:25:46,110
Come here.
