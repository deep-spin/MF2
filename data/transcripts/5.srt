1
00:00:11,301 --> 00:00:14,838
Officer, can you tell me
the way to Three Rivers?

2
00:00:14,838 --> 00:00:17,740
About two miles to the first
main intersection, then turn left,

3
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,142
it's about 60 miles.

4
00:00:19,142 --> 00:00:22,078
- Thanks. What town is this?
- "Suddenly".

5
00:00:22,078 --> 00:00:24,614
- Suddenly what?
- No, that's the name.

6
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:28,717
- Ha, ha, it's a funny name for a town.
- Hangover from the old days.

7
00:00:29,285 --> 00:00:31,720
That's the way things used
to happen here. Suddenly.

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,688
I see.

9
00:00:32,688 --> 00:00:36,625
- Road agents, gamblers, gun fighters.
- Well, I take it things have changed.

10
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,560
Things happen so slow now

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,030
the town council wants to change
the name to 'Gradually'.

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,233
- Ha ha, thanks officer.
- Pleasure, come back.

13
00:00:57,445 --> 00:00:58,245
Suddenly

14
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:04,007
Hello there, Pidge.

15
00:02:04,007 --> 00:02:06,610
- Hi Tod.
- Where's your mother?

16
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:10,647
We've been shopping. I gotta' put
this stuff in the car, wanna' come?

17
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,349
Yeah, sure.

18
00:02:14,084 --> 00:02:16,953
- Tod?
- Uh huh.

19
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,591
Well no. I guess not.
She wouldn't let me.

20
00:02:22,024 --> 00:02:23,993
- Who's she?
- Mom of course.

21
00:02:24,293 --> 00:02:26,295
Well then you'd better
say Mom, Pidge.

22
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:29,031
It's kinda' not polite to say 'she',
especially about your mother.

23
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:31,300
Well anyway, she wouldn't.

24
00:02:32,234 --> 00:02:33,802
You know, I bet I can guess
what's on your mind.

25
00:02:34,103 --> 00:02:35,204
Bet you can't.

26
00:02:35,204 --> 00:02:38,774
Well, now let's see.
You want an ice-cream soda?

27
00:02:38,774 --> 00:02:41,810
Um, not a bad idea,
but that's not it.

28
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:43,111
You wanna' go
to the movies?

29
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:46,281
No, that's a war picture.
Mom won't let me see those.

30
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:49,150
Boy oh boy,
this is tougher than I thought.

31
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:54,222
- I got it, you want that baseball bat.
- No, but you're awful warm.

32
00:02:57,258 --> 00:02:58,459
Is that it?

33
00:02:58,826 --> 00:03:03,530
Sure that's it. Ain't it a beauty?
But shucks, it's no use.

34
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,266
Mom won't let me have it.
She doesn't like guns.

35
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:07,534
I know.

36
00:03:07,534 --> 00:03:10,670
It's because of my father
being killed in the war.

37
00:03:10,904 --> 00:03:13,273
Look Pidge, if you had the gun,
what would you do with it?

38
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:15,842
- Stick up a filling station?
- Stick up a filling station.

39
00:03:15,842 --> 00:03:17,877
Heck no, I'd be Sheriff,

40
00:03:17,877 --> 00:03:21,514
and I'd catch all those road agents
and cattle rustlers. Just like you.

41
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:23,583
But what about Mom?

42
00:03:24,283 --> 00:03:27,453
I think we can persuade her, what with
you wanting to be a peace officer.

43
00:03:27,453 --> 00:03:30,956
We've got lots of time. Mom's still
in the market getting groceries.

44
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:33,659
Let's go.

45
00:03:49,207 --> 00:03:51,409
- Oh hell...
- I got it.

46
00:03:51,409 --> 00:03:52,677
Thanks Tod. Hello.

47
00:03:52,677 --> 00:03:54,512
Hi, can I give you
a lift to the house?

48
00:03:54,512 --> 00:03:56,580
Thanks, but I have
the car with me.

49
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,649
- Goin' to church tomorrow?
- Yes.

50
00:03:58,649 --> 00:04:00,718
I'll pick you up
about 10:45, huh?

51
00:04:01,185 --> 00:04:03,153
You never give up,
do you?

52
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:07,491
Ellen, I know how you feel, believe me
I do, and I've tried to understand, but...

53
00:04:07,491 --> 00:04:09,426
I haven't asked you
to understand.

54
00:04:09,426 --> 00:04:15,632
- That's because I'm in love with you.
- Tod... you shouldn't say that to me.

55
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,168
- Why not? It's true.
- Don't Tod.

56
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,172
Ellen, you can't go on
being a widow forever.

57
00:04:23,172 --> 00:04:25,374
It's been over three years
since Pete died.

58
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:28,477
Don't you understand?
No one can take Pete's place.

59
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:31,714
I'm not trying to take Pete's place.
I'm trying to make a place of my own.

60
00:04:32,448 --> 00:04:38,120
You've been wonderful Tod, and I'm
grateful, but I can't help how I feel.

61
00:04:39,888 --> 00:04:42,691
Ellen, you've got to stop
doing this to yourself,

62
00:04:42,691 --> 00:04:44,859
because you're doing it
to Pidge too, and to me.

63
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:47,362
You're digging a big pit
and shoving all of us into it.

64
00:04:47,362 --> 00:04:50,031
Leave me alone Tod,
please.

65
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:54,635
Pidge,
where did you get that gun?

66
00:04:54,635 --> 00:04:58,406
- I bought it for him, Ellen.
- Tod, how could you?

67
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:02,376
We thought you wouldn't mind,
cos' I'm gonna' be a sheriff, like Tod.

68
00:05:02,977 --> 00:05:04,912
- Take it off Pidge.
- Ellen.

69
00:05:04,912 --> 00:05:07,681
I can't help it, I can't stand
seeing him play with a gun.

70
00:05:07,681 --> 00:05:10,984
But the boy's gotta' learn sometime
that guns aren't necessarily bad.

71
00:05:10,984 --> 00:05:14,087
- Depends on who uses them.
- Tod carries one, doesn't he?

72
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:16,189
- Yes.
- Well then.

73
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:19,259
- Just take it off, Pidge.
- Aw gee!

74
00:05:21,894 --> 00:05:26,699
That's three dollars, please...
Thank you.

75
00:05:29,034 --> 00:05:30,269
Ellen.

76
00:05:30,836 --> 00:05:34,306
I know you don't want the boy
to see war pictures, but it seems...

77
00:05:34,306 --> 00:05:37,476
Teaching children the art of death and
destruction, the cruelties, the tortures...

78
00:05:37,476 --> 00:05:40,779
He's gotta' know that these things exist
and then he can fight against them,

79
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:44,015
when it's his turn.
You can't wrap the boy in cellophane.

80
00:05:44,015 --> 00:05:46,484
I can try, as long as possible.

81
00:05:46,484 --> 00:05:50,555
Look, when a house is on fire,
everybody has to help put it out,

82
00:05:50,555 --> 00:05:52,123
because the next time,
it might be your house.

83
00:05:52,123 --> 00:05:54,058
Oh Tod, don't.

84
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:06,837
- Church tomorrow, Ellen?
- No Tod, I can't go with you.

85
00:06:06,837 --> 00:06:10,907
I can't go on asking you and
get turned down. I mean that.

86
00:06:36,431 --> 00:06:40,635
Bebop. Goin' over to Tilly's for a cup
of java. You can handle things.

87
00:06:40,635 --> 00:06:41,736
It's a quiet day.

88
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:43,872
It's been a quiet day in this burg
for the last 50 years.

89
00:06:48,343 --> 00:06:49,310
For you?

90
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:00,855
- Good night shirt!
- What's the word?

91
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:04,191
Go get the Sheriff. Tell him to get
over here fast, it's an emergency!

92
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,770
Hey! Take it easy Pappy,
25 mile speed limit.

93
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,839
- Where's the Sheriff?
- Try the office... Hey, what the...?

94
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,342
- Where's Tod?
- Catch your breath. He's...

95
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:25,678
It's an emergency! Ed Hawkins
has gotta' see him now!

96
00:07:25,678 --> 00:07:26,679
What happened?

97
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,815
I don't know, something came
over the wire. Ed wouldn't say.

98
00:07:29,815 --> 00:07:32,618
Yeah, that's funny.
Well there's Tod now.

99
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:38,790
It's an emergency. Ed Hawkins
has gotta' see you right away!

100
00:08:14,224 --> 00:08:16,860
- Hello Ed.
- Thanks, get outta' here.

101
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,062
Wait a second.
I wanna' know what it's about.

102
00:08:19,062 --> 00:08:20,563
It's top secret,
get outta' here.

103
00:08:20,563 --> 00:08:23,332
- For Pete's sake, I ran my pants off...
- Blow.

104
00:08:23,332 --> 00:08:25,034
Aw shucks.

105
00:08:27,503 --> 00:08:28,471
What's the word?

106
00:08:28,471 --> 00:08:30,606
Listen to this.
I haven't finished typing it yet...

107
00:08:30,606 --> 00:08:35,110
Sheriff Tod Shaw, Suddenly, California.
<Confidential code: 'Hangover'. >

108
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:40,048
<Special train number 10.19 carrying>
<the President of the United States>

109
00:08:40,048 --> 00:08:42,717
<will arrive Suddenly 5pm today. >

110
00:08:42,984 --> 00:08:46,254
<President will detrain and>
<drive to White Springs Ranch. >

111
00:08:46,254 --> 00:08:50,858
<Will require adequate transportation. >
<Appreciate cooperation your staff. >

112
00:08:50,858 --> 00:08:54,929
<With secret service operators>
<arriving 1:15pm. >

113
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:57,264
<Carney acting chief U.S. >
<Secret Service. >

114
00:08:57,965 --> 00:09:00,601
- No mistakes, huh?
- Only in typing.

115
00:09:01,402 --> 00:09:05,572
5pm.
Now, can I use your phone?

116
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:07,040
Help yourself.

117
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:10,010
Give me State Police Headquarters
in Wetherby.

118
00:09:10,344 --> 00:09:12,512
- What's that code word again?
- 'Hangover'.

119
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:13,613
'Hangover'...

120
00:09:14,748 --> 00:09:18,852
Hello, this is Tod Shaw at Suddenly.
I wanna' speak to Captain Aaron.

121
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:21,654
There's number 20.
The 66th crossing.

122
00:09:21,954 --> 00:09:26,225
Hello Captain Aaron, this is Tod Shaw.
I've got a message here;

123
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:29,895
the code word is 'Hangover'.
I'm gonna' need five of your cars,

124
00:09:29,895 --> 00:09:33,198
two men and one Thompson gun
to each car, and...

125
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:38,203
Oh, you did?
Swell. Right, thanks.

126
00:09:39,671 --> 00:09:42,340
They got the same message. Aaron
has the show on the road already.

127
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,676
Gee!
Those state cops don't fool around!

128
00:09:44,676 --> 00:09:48,146
No, they don't.
Say, you didn't spill this, did you?

129
00:09:48,146 --> 00:09:50,214
It says confidential.

130
00:09:50,782 --> 00:09:54,719
Let's keep it that way. I'll run over to
Kaplan's garage. Back in a minute.

131
00:10:03,427 --> 00:10:06,930
- Hello Sheriff, be right with you.
- That's not soon enough, lz.

132
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,566
- So?
- I want the black Cadillac at 4:30pm.

133
00:10:09,566 --> 00:10:12,335
- The limousine?
- Park it at the station, backed in.

134
00:10:12,936 --> 00:10:14,838
Somebody getting married,
like the sheriff?

135
00:10:14,838 --> 00:10:17,841
Don't be funny, police business.
Don't tell anyone.

136
00:10:18,108 --> 00:10:18,942
I don't get it.

137
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:22,278
You're not supposed to.
4:30pm. No slip ups.

138
00:10:50,605 --> 00:10:52,573
- Mr. Carney?
- That's right.

139
00:10:52,573 --> 00:10:54,876
- My name's Shaw.
- Get my message?

140
00:10:55,076 --> 00:10:57,411
- What message?
- 'Hangover'.

141
00:10:58,646 --> 00:11:00,080
May I see
your credentials?

142
00:11:03,817 --> 00:11:04,818
This is Wilson.

143
00:11:04,818 --> 00:11:08,889
- Hi.
- Haggerty, Schultz and Kelly.

144
00:11:09,256 --> 00:11:12,225
Glad to make your acquaintance.
I got your message.

145
00:11:12,726 --> 00:11:14,127
You're a careful man,
sheriff.

146
00:11:14,127 --> 00:11:16,463
Not always. This seemed
like a good time to be.

147
00:11:16,996 --> 00:11:20,133
We always have to be.
May I see your credentials?

148
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,371
I got a limousine ordered for 4:30.
It'll be parked right here.

149
00:11:25,371 --> 00:11:26,414
Good.

150
00:11:27,406 --> 00:11:29,842
State police have five cars
on the road from Wetherby.

151
00:11:29,842 --> 00:11:31,877
- Excellent.
- I guess that's about it.

152
00:11:32,177 --> 00:11:32,878
Not quite...

153
00:11:34,013 --> 00:11:35,748
You can still be
of help to us...

154
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,652
We'll have to check those
stores facing the station.

155
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:44,322
Mr Carney, I know every
proprietor here. Believe me.

156
00:11:44,322 --> 00:11:48,593
Look, I'm sure they're OK.
It's just routine.

157
00:11:48,593 --> 00:11:50,495
Alright boys...

158
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:55,166
We'll park a limousine between
the tracks when the special arrives.

159
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,734
Pretty rough in there.

160
00:11:56,734 --> 00:12:00,604
Maybe, easier to cover.
All state police cars can go in there too.

161
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:01,772
Alright.

162
00:12:02,072 --> 00:12:04,742
Oh, er...
Who lives up there on the hill?

163
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,745
Pop Benson. His grandson
and his daughter- in-law.

164
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,280
We'll check it.

165
00:12:10,681 --> 00:12:14,818
Ha ha, Mr. Carney that's the one place
in this town that doesn't need checking.

166
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:18,822
Pop Benson used to be in the Secret
Service before a bad ticker retired him.

167
00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:21,791
Pop Benson!
You don't mean Peter Benson?

168
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:25,495
- That's right.
- Well I'll be a monkey's uncle.

169
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:27,463
What do you mean?

170
00:12:28,798 --> 00:12:30,966
Pete Benson used
to be my old boss.

171
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:33,369
No, how do you like that?

172
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:38,874
Mr Shaw, he'll be the last one
in the world to object... Pete Benson.

173
00:12:44,446 --> 00:12:47,215
Probably a rectifier
or a tube.

174
00:12:47,682 --> 00:12:50,919
Please call Jud, and ask him to fix it
before you wreck it?

175
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:55,890
Wreck it! Now you listen here,
I built a television transmitter in '38,

176
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,625
before you even knew
what television was.

177
00:12:57,925 --> 00:12:59,126
Yes, but did it work?

178
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:01,395
I don't know,
I never finished the receiver.

179
00:13:01,695 --> 00:13:03,998
Well, this is one,
and I wish you'd call Jud.

180
00:13:03,998 --> 00:13:06,667
I don't wanna'.
Besides it costs more on Saturdays.

181
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:09,403
It's cheaper than what it'd cost,
when you're finished with it.

182
00:13:09,803 --> 00:13:13,473
Stop taking it out on me,
just 'cos you and Tod had a fight!

183
00:13:15,342 --> 00:13:18,111
- You haven't touched your cake.
- Don't want it.

184
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:20,813
Pidge darling,
I made it especially for you.

185
00:13:20,813 --> 00:13:23,049
You made it because you
wouldn't let me wear my gun.

186
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,117
Drink your milk, darling.

187
00:13:25,117 --> 00:13:27,253
- Sissy.
- What?

188
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:29,321
That's what the guys call me.

189
00:13:29,588 --> 00:13:33,425
I don't care what they call you, I'm
your mother and I know what's best for you.

190
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:41,433
Pidge! Pidge, you shouldn't
walk out when I'm talking to you.

191
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:42,834
I thought you
were finished.

192
00:13:43,034 --> 00:13:45,337
The boy's just
disappointed, that's all.

193
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,639
Dad, please stop interfering.

194
00:13:49,374 --> 00:13:52,677
First you take him out of the
Highcliff Cub Scouts, and then...

195
00:13:52,677 --> 00:13:54,212
Pidge, go to your room.

196
00:13:54,712 --> 00:13:58,449
I'll have this old set perkin' in a minute
son; then we'll watch the ball game.

197
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,252
Dad, I've had this
for the last time.

198
00:14:01,252 --> 00:14:05,255
Ellen, you're a grown-up girl. You got a
problem you haven't worked out.

199
00:14:05,522 --> 00:14:08,158
That's no reason why Pidge
should have your problem.

200
00:14:08,492 --> 00:14:10,994
I've only done
what I thought was right.

201
00:14:12,262 --> 00:14:16,199
I read about an experiment once.
Kept germs away from a kid.

202
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:19,302
Raised him pure and scientifically.
First time he went out,

203
00:14:19,302 --> 00:14:21,404
he caught cold
and died of pneumonia.

204
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:22,905
What has that to do with Pidge?

205
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:25,775
The kid hadn't been exposed,
he had no immunity.

206
00:14:25,775 --> 00:14:29,912
There's cruelty, hatred and tyranny
in the world. You can't ignore it.

207
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:33,515
Pidge's gonna' learn about
the law, so's he can defend it.

208
00:14:33,816 --> 00:14:38,287
Defend it? So he can become a soldier
and be murdered like his father?

209
00:14:40,756 --> 00:14:43,458
My son was killed in the
performance of his duty, Ellen.

210
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:46,995
Duty, being blown to bits on
some god-forsaken battlefield,

211
00:14:46,995 --> 00:14:50,131
thousand of miles from where
he was born. You call that duty?

212
00:14:50,131 --> 00:14:51,466
Yes Ellen.

213
00:14:51,466 --> 00:14:54,435
Well, is that what you'd like for Pidge?
Would that make you happy?

214
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:58,039
If Pete could hear you now,
he'd be ashamed of you.

215
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,443
How can you say
a terrible thing like that?

216
00:15:03,544 --> 00:15:07,147
The old boys wrote the words: 'Life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'

217
00:15:07,147 --> 00:15:10,417
They sounded mighty nice, but they
wouldn't have been worth a nickel,

218
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:12,986
if somebody hadn't
made 'em stick.

219
00:15:15,522 --> 00:15:18,858
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Look out the window! Golly!

220
00:15:18,858 --> 00:15:20,760
What is it?

221
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:25,865
Coming down from Wetherby,
a whole lot of state troopers, see 'em?

222
00:15:39,011 --> 00:15:40,479
Sure cut it fine.

223
00:15:40,846 --> 00:15:43,715
You couldn't possibly be surprised
with those sirens blasting.

224
00:15:43,715 --> 00:15:47,786
- So I tried to beat 'em.
- State troopers, right on time.

225
00:15:48,186 --> 00:15:49,287
Oh, they're good.

226
00:15:49,287 --> 00:15:52,223
- The best, alright Bart, follow me.
- Ok.

227
00:15:53,725 --> 00:15:56,627
There are two routes
to the White Springs Ranch:

228
00:15:56,627 --> 00:15:59,830
Over the mountains, or you
can go down to the main highway,

229
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,900
go into Three Rivers, the ranch
is about 20 miles further out.

230
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,835
We'll stick to the main highway.

231
00:16:04,835 --> 00:16:08,071
Too much chance for an ambush
in those mountains. Yes Haggerty?

232
00:16:08,071 --> 00:16:11,208
We could use a roof watch on those
stores Chief, and a street check.

233
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:15,312
Mr. Carney, every proprietor in this
town has been here at least five years.

234
00:16:15,312 --> 00:16:16,846
I know them, I know their kids.

235
00:16:16,846 --> 00:16:21,351
It's not that sheriff; it's the stranger that
might use one of those stores for cover.

236
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:25,822
I'd like them to lock up at 4:50,
stay locked up until 5:10.

237
00:16:25,822 --> 00:16:30,226
- Oh, and put a man on the roof too.
- Alright Bert, give 'em the word.

238
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:34,196
No one is to remain in
those stores at locking time,

239
00:16:34,196 --> 00:16:38,033
anyone seen inside after 4:50,
might be shot on sight.

240
00:16:38,534 --> 00:16:41,670
- Like the man says it's important.
- Yes Sir.

241
00:16:42,404 --> 00:16:45,674
Tell Wilson to keep the station clear.
Schultz will take over troopers

242
00:16:45,674 --> 00:16:47,842
and block off traffic approaches
from 4:30 onwards.

243
00:16:48,043 --> 00:16:50,378
Right. There's another hazard Sir.
A house up on the hill.

244
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:54,182
Yeah, I know.
I'll check that one myself.

245
00:16:54,482 --> 00:16:55,450
Yes Sir.

246
00:16:58,219 --> 00:17:00,855
Tod, what the Hades
is going on in this burg?

247
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:02,923
Did some Galoot make
a uranium strike?

248
00:17:03,224 --> 00:17:07,461
Not exactly. Now look Slim you take
over here and we'll catch up later.

249
00:17:07,828 --> 00:17:11,365
Keep all pedestrian traffic off
the main street from 4:30

250
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,767
between Oak and Alder,
the state boys will help 'ya,

251
00:17:13,767 --> 00:17:16,770
if anybody in town squawks,
why you smooth things over.

252
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:19,305
They know you, and this is
going to seem strange to them.

253
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:23,009
I'm confused myself, never have seen
so many cops. What goes on?

254
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:27,880
This is Mr Carney, special agent of the
Treasury Department, Secret Service.

255
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,649
Mr Carney, Slim Adams,
one of my deputies.

256
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,586
How do you do?
Secret Service. I get it.

257
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,689
They're shipping the national
debt through here in gold bars.

258
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,926
Just don't worry about it,
you'll find out later.

259
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:44,062
Right come on.
Let's go and check that car you hired.

260
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,344
Bang, bang got 'em all.

261
00:18:00,344 --> 00:18:03,214
Buffalo Bill, you'd better put that gun
away before your Mom sees it,

262
00:18:03,214 --> 00:18:04,715
she'll tan you a hide.

263
00:18:09,052 --> 00:18:12,322
Dad! I do wish you'd call Jud
and let him come up and fix that.

264
00:18:12,322 --> 00:18:15,425
Shucks, Ellen, I knew Ohms Law
before they even passed it.

265
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:19,095
Don't want Pidge to miss the ball
game, after missing the movie and all.

266
00:18:19,295 --> 00:18:21,197
Alright, boy,
get ready to plug this set in

267
00:18:21,197 --> 00:18:23,866
while I hold this screw down
and see what happens.

268
00:18:23,866 --> 00:18:24,801
Okay.

269
00:18:25,401 --> 00:18:27,036
Dad, are you sure you
know what you're doing?

270
00:18:27,036 --> 00:18:28,204
Ellen, please.

271
00:18:28,204 --> 00:18:32,007
But it says on the back that there's
5000 volts, and that's dangerous.

272
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:38,580
Ellen, please stop being a woman...
Ready boy, plug in.

273
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,119
Dad! Dad! Are you alright?

274
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:47,455
I guess I'm alright, it scared
the pants of me, that's all.

275
00:18:47,455 --> 00:18:49,057
Golly, look at this.

276
00:18:49,057 --> 00:18:51,125
I guess maybe
you'd better call Jud, huh?

277
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,560
Honestly.

278
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:57,131
- That was a close call, boy.
- How much is 5000 volts?

279
00:18:57,131 --> 00:18:58,966
- Enough.
- It would kill you?

280
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,735
It would probably pick you up
and toss you across the room.

281
00:19:01,735 --> 00:19:04,638
Unless you were standing in a puddle
of water, then you'd be grounded.

282
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:07,074
And if you were grounded, it'd
kill you deader than a doornail.

283
00:19:07,074 --> 00:19:08,509
Would it hurt?

284
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:12,112
Like blazes. You stay away from that
set now, and from those wall plugs.

285
00:19:12,312 --> 00:19:15,348
Don't monkey with electricity unless
you know what you're doing.

286
00:19:15,682 --> 00:19:19,119
- Why did you, Grandpa?
- You got me there, boy.

287
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,690
I'll get it. Jud says he'll be up
in a little while.

288
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,425
- I'm sorry.
- Honestly...

289
00:19:28,628 --> 00:19:30,329
- Yes?
- Mrs Benson?

290
00:19:30,329 --> 00:19:32,198
- That's right.
- Is your husband at home?

291
00:19:32,198 --> 00:19:34,366
My hus...
No I'm a widow.

292
00:19:34,566 --> 00:19:37,269
What I should have asked was,
are you the owner of this house?

293
00:19:37,269 --> 00:19:40,572
No I'm not. It belongs to my
father-in-law. What is it you want?

294
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:44,109
I'm John Baron, special agent,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

295
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:46,044
These are my men.

296
00:19:46,044 --> 00:19:48,613
Do you suppose I could have
a few words with Mr. Benson?

297
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,050
Just a moment,
won't you come in? Dad!

298
00:19:53,751 --> 00:19:56,988
- Oh, how are you gents?
- John Baron, special agent.

299
00:19:58,055 --> 00:20:00,558
- For heavens' sake. FBI?
- May we come in?

300
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:04,328
Why sure, come right in and
make yourselves at home.

301
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,796
- Thanks.
- Not at all.

302
00:20:05,796 --> 00:20:08,332
I get quite a kick out of this, used to be
with the Treasury Department myself.

303
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,099
Really?

304
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:11,935
- Back in the old days.
- Collector of Internal Revenue, eh.

305
00:20:11,935 --> 00:20:14,471
Tax Collector, not on your life.
Secret Service.

306
00:20:14,471 --> 00:20:15,605
You don't say?

307
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:17,774
Grandpa was President
Coolidge's bodyguard.

308
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,075
You don't say?

309
00:20:19,275 --> 00:20:23,413
Yep, back in 1928. Youngest retirement
in the service, account of my heart.

310
00:20:23,413 --> 00:20:26,449
Not heart trouble you understand,
an accident on one of Cal's fishing trips.

311
00:20:26,449 --> 00:20:31,153
- A hunter, got the slug right here.
- Say, that's a nasty one.

312
00:20:31,654 --> 00:20:32,888
How come you're still alive?

313
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:35,624
I don't know, lodged in my heart.
They took it out. Had to take it easy,

314
00:20:35,624 --> 00:20:37,025
so they retired me.

315
00:20:37,025 --> 00:20:39,461
- You're lucky.
- Luckier still if it hadn't hit me.

316
00:20:39,461 --> 00:20:41,730
I'm gonna' be in the
Secret Service someday.

317
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:43,698
Thought you was gonna'
be a Sheriff, like Tod.

318
00:20:43,698 --> 00:20:46,067
Squirts like you are supposed
to grow up to be President.

319
00:20:46,067 --> 00:20:48,336
- Name's Pidge, Mr Baron.
- Glad to meet you, Pidge.

320
00:20:48,336 --> 00:20:49,471
I ain't a squirt!

321
00:20:49,938 --> 00:20:53,274
Mr Baron, what did you want to
see us about, is something wrong?

322
00:20:53,274 --> 00:20:56,277
Nothing wrong yet Mrs Benson, but
there might be. We're just checking.

323
00:20:56,277 --> 00:20:57,478
On us?

324
00:20:57,478 --> 00:20:59,613
On the house.
Do you mind if we a look around?

325
00:20:59,613 --> 00:21:00,981
Help yourself,
but I wanna' know...

326
00:21:00,981 --> 00:21:04,084
We're gonna' look around, with or
without your permission, Mr Benson.

327
00:21:04,084 --> 00:21:06,487
It's an emergency.
Check it.

328
00:21:14,861 --> 00:21:16,529
There must be
something the matter.

329
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:18,465
Anyone else live here,
besides you three?

330
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:22,669
- No.
- Anyone been by here today?

331
00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:23,770
No.

332
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,671
Just the usual routine.
Willy Harris left the milk.

333
00:21:25,671 --> 00:21:30,109
- What's this all about Mr Baron?
- Just being careful, I'll explain later.

334
00:21:32,144 --> 00:21:36,849
- Two bedrooms, one bathroom, clear.
- One here, just like they said.

335
00:21:40,085 --> 00:21:43,789
Kitchen, pantry, back door, stairs go
down to the garage under kitchen,

336
00:21:43,789 --> 00:21:46,858
cellar door in hall, clear.
Car in the garage.

337
00:21:48,493 --> 00:21:51,229
Look at this for a setup...

338
00:21:53,798 --> 00:21:56,767
Sorry folks, but I'm afraid we're gonna'
have to hang around for a while.

339
00:21:56,767 --> 00:21:58,069
- Why?
- What's the matter?

340
00:21:58,069 --> 00:22:00,504
- Don't be alarmed, nothing's wrong.
- Of course there is.

341
00:22:00,504 --> 00:22:02,406
The FBI
doesn't pay us a visit for nothing.

342
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:06,910
- I won't stay. I'll take Pidge and go.
- No Ma'am, nobody leaves until we do.

343
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,579
Why not?
What's happened?

344
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:11,848
Look just go about your business, like
it was any other Saturday afternoon.

345
00:22:11,848 --> 00:22:16,519
Read your papers, watch TV,
anything, but nobody leaves the house.

346
00:22:19,089 --> 00:22:22,191
- Something fishy about all this.
- It's official business.

347
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:23,960
What sort of official business?

348
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,496
Mr Benson, as a former agent of the
Secret Service, you should understand.

349
00:22:27,496 --> 00:22:29,765
Either I'm getting old
and stupid, or else I'm...

350
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:33,936
At 5pm, the President
will arrive in town on a special...

351
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,871
- What?
- Golly!

352
00:22:35,871 --> 00:22:39,208
The President,
well that's different.

353
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:42,277
You mean the President's
gonna' get off the train here?

354
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,178
That's right.

355
00:22:43,178 --> 00:22:44,980
Gramps,
we gotta' see it.

356
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,615
That's the greatest thing ever
to happen to this town.

357
00:22:47,615 --> 00:22:49,684
Can we go down
and see it Gramps? Can we?

358
00:22:49,884 --> 00:22:54,856
Sorry kid, no! Benny, bring in
the gear. Put the car out back.

359
00:22:55,389 --> 00:22:58,859
Bart, you see the back door's
locked tight and check the cellar.

360
00:23:01,128 --> 00:23:02,930
I still don't understand.

361
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:08,035
Mr Benson, if anyone wanted to kill the
President, he could do a beautiful job,

362
00:23:08,035 --> 00:23:10,337
right from this window of yours.

363
00:23:10,337 --> 00:23:13,573
For the love of Mike, that may be true,
but you don't think that Ellie and me...

364
00:23:13,573 --> 00:23:15,742
Of course not,
but we have to remain here

365
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:18,578
to protect you and the President,
from someone who might.

366
00:23:18,578 --> 00:23:19,204
Oh.

367
00:23:34,927 --> 00:23:36,395
- Carney?
- Yeah.

368
00:23:36,395 --> 00:23:41,833
Is all this checking routine?
Looks like you expect this town to...

369
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:45,704
Sheriff, have you noticed any strangers
in town during the past week.

370
00:23:46,271 --> 00:23:48,006
- No.
- Are you sure?

371
00:23:48,006 --> 00:23:52,644
Yes I'm sure. I know everybody here.
The only strangers we get are tourists.

372
00:23:52,644 --> 00:23:55,947
We get 'em all the time, stopping
for gas, a bite to eat. That's all.

373
00:23:56,147 --> 00:24:00,518
We wanna' know from you
or your deputies, if any stranger stays!

374
00:24:00,985 --> 00:24:03,821
- Then this isn't routine.
- No it isn't.

375
00:24:04,622 --> 00:24:05,589
Can you tell me?

376
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:09,293
The LA police picked up a small-time
stool pigeon night before last,

377
00:24:09,293 --> 00:24:10,928
shot through the lungs
and left for dead.

378
00:24:10,928 --> 00:24:14,264
Smiley Bitters. Before he died,
he told them something was up.

379
00:24:14,264 --> 00:24:16,533
What do you mean,
something was up?

380
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:19,869
- An assassination attempt.
- Well, can you believe that?

381
00:24:20,436 --> 00:24:24,374
- In our business we can't afford not to.
- I mean the tip of a dying stool pigeon.

382
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,010
The Stoolie seemed very proud of being
an American, before he kicked off.

383
00:24:29,245 --> 00:24:32,248
Meaning crime is crime,
but this is something else again.

384
00:24:32,248 --> 00:24:35,651
Right, so we can't take
any chances. Let's go.

385
00:24:40,155 --> 00:24:43,525
Can we see the President,
grandpa? Can we Mom?

386
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:46,294
No Pidge, we have to stay here.
You can watch him from here.

387
00:24:46,294 --> 00:24:47,595
But I wanna' get up close.

388
00:24:47,595 --> 00:24:50,165
Well, use your telescope boy.
Bring him right up to your eye.

389
00:24:50,165 --> 00:24:52,967
- Aah!
- Sorry Pidge, no dice.

390
00:24:53,167 --> 00:24:55,870
Back door locked. How about the phone
in the kitchen, want me to yank it?

391
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:58,806
No, we don't change the pattern.
Give Benny a hand.

392
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:06,413
Mr Baron, I don't understand,
I was in the service myself...

393
00:25:06,413 --> 00:25:08,215
So you told me.

394
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:11,885
Though we made every precautionary
check, we never went to extremes...

395
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,354
...unless you were tipped
about an assassination attempt.

396
00:25:14,354 --> 00:25:16,423
- You don't mean it?
- I mean it.

397
00:25:16,423 --> 00:25:19,826
But you're FBI Secret Service
is responsible for the President.

398
00:25:20,193 --> 00:25:23,896
We're using everybody this trip,
Mr Benson, have a look down there.

399
00:25:25,331 --> 00:25:28,634
State troopers, your local law
enforcement agencies and us.

400
00:25:29,302 --> 00:25:32,071
Do you know if old Dan
Carney is down there?

401
00:25:32,071 --> 00:25:36,809
We worked together in the old days.
He's chief of the presidential staff now.

402
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:40,746
- That's confidential information.
- This is a terrible thing.

403
00:25:40,746 --> 00:25:42,748
Not your worry,
Mr Benson.

404
00:25:42,748 --> 00:25:46,084
Of course it's my worry; I'm an
American ain't I? It's everybody's worry.

405
00:25:46,084 --> 00:25:48,787
Car. Somebody's
driving up to the house.

406
00:25:48,787 --> 00:25:53,124
- Who is it?
- It's Tod.

407
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:55,393
He's the Sheriff, Mr Baron.

408
00:25:55,393 --> 00:25:57,662
- There's someone with him.
- Who is it?

409
00:25:57,662 --> 00:26:01,132
- I don't know, never seen him before.
- Well for the love of Mike!

410
00:26:01,132 --> 00:26:02,166
What?

411
00:26:02,166 --> 00:26:06,103
It's old Dan Carney, greyer than an old
shirt and redder in the face as ever!

412
00:26:07,771 --> 00:26:08,806
Hi Pop, got an old friend
of yours here.

413
00:26:08,806 --> 00:26:10,240
Hi Pop, got an old friend
of yours here.

414
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,177
- Dan, you dirty old Irishman!
- Hello Pop, how are you?

415
00:26:14,177 --> 00:26:17,213
- Hey, why aren't you dead?
- Oh, Buzzards like me live forever!

416
00:26:17,213 --> 00:26:18,948
Hey old Hawkeye,
you're getting bald.

417
00:26:18,948 --> 00:26:21,551
What do you expect
after 25 years?

418
00:26:21,551 --> 00:26:23,586
Come on in,
make yourself at home.

419
00:26:23,853 --> 00:26:25,321
This is my daughter-in-law.

420
00:26:25,321 --> 00:26:26,923
- This is my grandson, Pidge.
- Hi 'ya Pidge.

421
00:26:26,923 --> 00:26:30,159
Pidge, this is Mr. Carney, Secret
Service. He guards the President.

422
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,428
- Like Mr Baron.
- Who?

423
00:26:32,428 --> 00:26:35,698
Baron. Oh, you didn't know.
Your boy's got here ahead of you.

424
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:42,270
Sheriff!

425
00:26:45,373 --> 00:26:46,641
Mom!

426
00:26:54,515 --> 00:26:57,952
One sound from the kid,
Pop, and he's dead.

427
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,674
Train muffled it...

428
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,513
Get rid of him. Put him in the cellar.
And you'd better take the rug with you,

429
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:28,814
it's a give-away...

430
00:27:34,253 --> 00:27:35,854
You get the message,
brave boy?

431
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,589
Mom! Mom!

432
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,659
Pidge, you've gotta'
be still, no noise.

433
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,729
- You stink!
- Pidge shut up!

434
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:48,099
- Guts.
- He's only eight.

435
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,168
Lots of guts.

436
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:51,302
Mom.

437
00:27:54,605 --> 00:27:56,574
No trouble with you,
you're all busted up.

438
00:28:05,082 --> 00:28:10,320
Alright, take care of her.
You got it now, let's be practical.

439
00:28:11,888 --> 00:28:14,024
I don't want any more
shooting around here.

440
00:28:14,224 --> 00:28:18,328
I want it nice and quiet and cosy.
Now get her up and bring her around

441
00:28:18,328 --> 00:28:22,232
and explain to her that one phoney
and she's got a kid with his throat cut.

442
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:27,470
Doesn't make much noise that way.
The same goes for you too.

443
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:30,139
Anybody step out of line...
The boy!

444
00:28:31,474 --> 00:28:32,908
That's simple enough.

445
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:41,617
Ellen, listen to me. Pay attention. Now
listen to me and don't look like that.

446
00:28:41,617 --> 00:28:46,054
Everybody's alright. Get a hold of
yourself. No matter what happens,

447
00:28:46,054 --> 00:28:47,255
you've got to hang on.

448
00:28:47,756 --> 00:28:51,025
If you scream, or make one
false move, he'll murder the boy.

449
00:28:51,259 --> 00:28:53,294
You understand,
he'll murder Pidge.

450
00:28:57,598 --> 00:28:59,433
Do you hear him, Lady?

451
00:28:59,967 --> 00:29:01,469
Yes, yes.

452
00:29:02,603 --> 00:29:06,407
Good, then we're all in accord.
Alright, alright, inside.

453
00:29:06,707 --> 00:29:08,675
We've got a long time to wait.
Relax...

454
00:29:11,445 --> 00:29:13,547
Move the kitchen table
in front of the window.

455
00:29:15,182 --> 00:29:18,518
- Alright, sit down. Look at your TV.
- It ain't workin'.

456
00:29:18,952 --> 00:29:22,555
Well, work him over then. Fix him up.
Don't sit there waiting to blow your cork.

457
00:29:22,555 --> 00:29:24,891
Keep yourselves occupied.
I gotta' think.

458
00:29:34,934 --> 00:29:36,902
Tod, Tod, are you
badly hurt?

459
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:39,371
The bullet hit the bone,
broke it I guess. He's bled a lot.

460
00:29:39,371 --> 00:29:41,173
We need a doctor,
look at his face.

461
00:29:43,308 --> 00:29:44,409
Tell her Pop.

462
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:46,811
You're the doctor, Ellen.
We can't have no doctor.

463
00:29:46,811 --> 00:29:48,346
We can't set
a broken arm.

464
00:29:49,114 --> 00:29:50,381
Tough.

465
00:29:50,882 --> 00:29:52,784
- Can you?
- Me?

466
00:29:52,784 --> 00:29:56,788
- Straighten this fracture.
- You couldn't take it.

467
00:29:58,122 --> 00:30:02,393
- You straighten it.
- Hold on brave boy...

468
00:30:12,969 --> 00:30:14,037
Tie it up.

469
00:30:16,573 --> 00:30:18,541
May we take him
into the bedroom?

470
00:30:18,842 --> 00:30:21,244
Sure,
though the boy stays here...

471
00:30:30,486 --> 00:30:32,054
And leave the door open.

472
00:30:35,991 --> 00:30:37,459
Alright,
let's go to work.

473
00:30:56,844 --> 00:30:58,813
Pop, we gotta'
do something.

474
00:30:58,813 --> 00:31:00,615
Well I know, I know,
but what? What?

475
00:31:00,615 --> 00:31:03,751
- They've got Pidge.
- None of us count. Not even Pidge.

476
00:31:03,751 --> 00:31:06,487
- We haven't got a chance.
- As long as we're alive, we've got one.

477
00:31:06,487 --> 00:31:09,990
- We've got to find a flaw in his plan.
- We'll think of something.

478
00:31:10,691 --> 00:31:12,492
Pop, haven't you got a gun?

479
00:31:13,026 --> 00:31:18,999
Gun...
Here in this drawer. My gun.

480
00:31:25,004 --> 00:31:26,939
- Is it loaded?
- No.

481
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,542
I hid the cartridges
on account of Pidge.

482
00:31:31,043 --> 00:31:33,012
You're a dirty
lousy gangster!

483
00:31:33,512 --> 00:31:35,481
- Why you.
- Leave him alone, Benny.

484
00:31:35,481 --> 00:31:36,582
Did you hear
what he said?

485
00:31:36,582 --> 00:31:38,951
Yeah, I heard. He's been
watching too much television.

486
00:31:38,951 --> 00:31:41,720
- He ain't a bad squirt.
- Just tell him to shut up.

487
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,888
Sure, sure.

488
00:31:44,923 --> 00:31:47,792
- This thing's metal.
- Steel top, chrome legs.

489
00:31:49,361 --> 00:31:50,395
I figured wood.

490
00:31:50,729 --> 00:31:53,131
No difference, screw the brackets
to the legs, then to the floor,

491
00:31:53,131 --> 00:31:54,866
that way the table
won't dance.

492
00:31:54,866 --> 00:31:56,701
You're a bunch
of cowards!

493
00:31:57,869 --> 00:32:00,871
You're getting too fresh.
So button it.

494
00:32:03,641 --> 00:32:05,976
Johnny, why all the trouble?
This is a lot of work.

495
00:32:05,976 --> 00:32:06,810
Do it Benny.

496
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:09,213
- But Johnny, I don't see why we...
- I said just do it, Benny...

497
00:32:11,148 --> 00:32:13,617
Once you get the gun anchored,
you've got a solid base.

498
00:32:13,617 --> 00:32:15,485
You'll see when
we get to it.

499
00:32:15,719 --> 00:32:17,854
This gun's got a heavy recoil
and won't stand still.

500
00:32:19,956 --> 00:32:23,293
We've got just three seconds
to nail the President

501
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,996
and I don't want the table
to shimmy when we get to it.

502
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,198
A tommy gun
would do just as good.

503
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:33,602
A tommy gun stinks. No accuracy,
no punch. Might as well use a revolver.

504
00:32:34,336 --> 00:32:36,538
This is the gun.

505
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,676
- When I was in the army.
- So I wasn't in the army.

506
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:45,313
Tighter, tighter.
Pop find those cartridges yet?

507
00:32:45,614 --> 00:32:46,748
Not yet.

508
00:32:47,015 --> 00:32:49,684
This is quite a gun, Benny.
Quite a gun.

509
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:54,455
I did a lot of choppin' in the war
with a baby like this, a lot of choppin'.

510
00:32:57,825 --> 00:33:00,628
You're wrong about me Pidge,
bein' a coward.

511
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:07,201
Last war, I got a Silver Star,
north of Casino, pocket of resistance.

512
00:33:08,869 --> 00:33:14,107
I killed 27 men, all by myself.
I won a Silver Star medal.

513
00:33:14,641 --> 00:33:16,309
Ah, you stole it.

514
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,516
- They're hurting Pidge.
- Alright, take it easy.

515
00:33:23,716 --> 00:33:30,456
Johnny, take it easy, relax, for the love
of Mike. What's a Silver Star?

516
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:38,630
- I won it.
- OK Johnny, OK, you won it.

517
00:33:45,103 --> 00:33:46,238
I got 'em.

518
00:33:47,138 --> 00:33:51,309
- They've been in there a long time.
- Yeah, get 'em back in here.

519
00:33:53,845 --> 00:34:02,620
What are you all trying to pull?
All of you inside... Come on, come on.

520
00:34:07,991 --> 00:34:09,593
- Feeling better?
- Yeah.

521
00:34:09,593 --> 00:34:12,696
You're lucky, he didn't mean to wing ya,
he meant to blow your brains out.

522
00:34:12,696 --> 00:34:13,830
He's a bad shot.

523
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:17,067
Yeah, but I'm not, so maybe you'd
better sit down and stay there,

524
00:34:17,334 --> 00:34:19,202
that way it'd be safer
for everybody.

525
00:34:19,202 --> 00:34:22,839
You've got that duty look in your eye.
I've seen it up on the line.

526
00:34:22,839 --> 00:34:26,042
- The line? You up on the line?
- Some other time. Down!

527
00:34:33,182 --> 00:34:36,552
Bart, you fool. His car's out front.
Put it in the garage, quick...

528
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,088
I have to think
of everything.

529
00:34:40,522 --> 00:34:43,558
- Oh great, just great.
- Might as well advertise.

530
00:34:44,993 --> 00:34:46,228
That was a close one.

531
00:34:52,834 --> 00:34:54,335
Hot in here...

532
00:35:02,576 --> 00:35:04,345
See what time it is?

533
00:35:05,379 --> 00:35:07,114
Alright, suppose you tell me
what happens in this house

534
00:35:07,114 --> 00:35:09,383
on a Saturday afternoon,
between four and five.

535
00:35:09,883 --> 00:35:10,951
Pattern.

536
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:17,857
Smart guy. Sure, and we don't break
that pattern. We're here for a reason

537
00:35:17,857 --> 00:35:20,293
and if we break it, we might
blow the deal, you know?

538
00:35:20,293 --> 00:35:23,129
Mario slings the paper
over the fence, around 4:30.

539
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:28,267
Delivery boy, does he come in?
Anyone else?

540
00:35:28,601 --> 00:35:31,404
Cy Hammel went up the mountain
hunting jack rabbits.

541
00:35:31,404 --> 00:35:34,640
- He'll be by on his way back.
- Will he stop?

542
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,009
Not unless he's got
something to brag about.

543
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:38,644
Anybody else.

544
00:35:38,644 --> 00:35:39,912
Nobody.

545
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,449
Anybody know that you and
the other guy were coming up here?

546
00:35:44,449 --> 00:35:48,386
- That's an interesting question.
- What's the interesting answer?

547
00:35:48,386 --> 00:35:50,488
- You guess.
- Tell him Tod.

548
00:35:51,489 --> 00:35:54,459
Sheriff, if you think I have any
qualms about killing this kid,

549
00:35:54,459 --> 00:35:56,094
you couldn't be more wrong.

550
00:35:57,061 --> 00:36:00,331
The thing about killing him,
or you, or her, or him,

551
00:36:00,331 --> 00:36:02,533
is that I wouldn't be getting'
paid for it...

552
00:36:04,301 --> 00:36:06,637
and I don't like giving
anything away for free.

553
00:36:07,304 --> 00:36:10,340
Neither do I,
including information.

554
00:36:11,575 --> 00:36:14,311
Your guts are showing
all over the place, brave boy.

555
00:36:14,778 --> 00:36:18,615
No, not me, I'm scared.
You see the way I figure it Baron,

556
00:36:18,615 --> 00:36:22,819
I'm a dead man anyway,
so's the boy, so's Ellen, so's Pop.

557
00:36:22,819 --> 00:36:26,255
Just a question of now or later, and if it
gives the President a bit of an edge,

558
00:36:26,255 --> 00:36:27,723
well then, we get it now.

559
00:36:27,723 --> 00:36:29,592
They won't hurt us, they won't hurt.
Pidge, they said so.

560
00:36:29,592 --> 00:36:33,262
Because it's convenient Ellen. You think
these crumbs would kill the President

561
00:36:33,262 --> 00:36:35,531
and then take off, leaving us
behind to identify them.

562
00:36:35,531 --> 00:36:37,066
You said
you wouldn't hurt Pidge.

563
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:39,168
Sure, sure, and I meant it.

564
00:36:39,168 --> 00:36:43,171
Don't listen to this guy, he's just
being brave with your kid's life.

565
00:36:43,171 --> 00:36:47,342
I knew guys like that in the army.
We're just doing a job that's all,

566
00:36:47,342 --> 00:36:49,411
identifying us is not involved.

567
00:36:50,445 --> 00:36:53,248
By 7 o'clock tonight, we'll be out of the
country and you'll never see us again.

568
00:36:53,448 --> 00:36:54,282
Tell him Tod, tell him.

569
00:36:54,282 --> 00:36:57,385
Never mind lady, we'll just assume
that they knew he was coming up here,

570
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:01,355
so that if somebody else checks
on him, you can tell him

571
00:37:01,355 --> 00:37:05,092
that the sheriff and his friend were here,
but they had to go someplace else.

572
00:37:05,092 --> 00:37:06,093
That's all.

573
00:37:06,093 --> 00:37:07,728
I have to go
to the bathroom.

574
00:37:11,698 --> 00:37:13,367
Go with him Bart.

575
00:37:15,535 --> 00:37:18,071
- I don't need any help.
- Come on, come on.

576
00:37:19,472 --> 00:37:21,441
Okay,
table's screwed down.

577
00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:24,811
Alright, get the tripod up there, drill
a hole in each leg, bolt it to the table

578
00:37:24,811 --> 00:37:27,213
put it centre
in front of the window...

579
00:37:28,681 --> 00:37:30,549
I thought
I told you to sit down.

580
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:33,686
Just stretching my legs.
You're a very careful man.

581
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,588
That's right.

582
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:37,122
Planned on
everything, huh?

583
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:40,325
Sheriff, the first man they shoot to the
moon on a rocket will take pains too,

584
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:43,028
'cos that's never been
done before. Neither has this.

585
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:44,996
Doesn't that worry you?

586
00:37:45,197 --> 00:37:48,967
Haven't got time to worry, I just make
my plans and carry 'em out.

587
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:51,803
That's what
John Wilkes Booth thought too.

588
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:55,974
Booth! Ha, I'm no actor
busting my leg on a stage,

589
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:58,176
so I can yell
"Down with the tyrants!"

590
00:37:58,176 --> 00:38:00,778
If Booth wasn't such a ham,
he might have made it.

591
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,647
He got pretty far
at that, though.

592
00:38:03,647 --> 00:38:05,816
The guy who killed Garfield
didn't make it either.

593
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:10,087
Him! Ha, he didn't plan anything. Just
took a lucky shot, strictly left-handed.

594
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:11,455
Just like McKinley.

595
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:14,925
And Zangara got the chair
for his try at Roosevelt.

596
00:38:16,226 --> 00:38:19,929
He had to try it in a crowd,
I hate crowds.

597
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:21,998
So nobody ever made it.

598
00:38:23,433 --> 00:38:27,703
Up till here...
I'm just a guy makin' a livin'

599
00:38:28,971 --> 00:38:32,141
and I think you've stretched
long enough. As you were.

600
00:38:37,046 --> 00:38:39,314
- Bart take over Benny's watch.
- Okay.

601
00:38:39,314 --> 00:38:41,783
- Benny?
- Yeah Johnny.

602
00:38:42,818 --> 00:38:45,153
Go down town and see what's
goin' on, especially the station plan.

603
00:38:45,153 --> 00:38:46,721
Leave the car here.

604
00:38:46,955 --> 00:38:47,923
Why me?

605
00:38:47,923 --> 00:38:50,592
Because Wheeler can fly
a plane, and you can't.

606
00:38:50,592 --> 00:38:52,026
Oh, but I'm
expendable, huh?

607
00:38:52,026 --> 00:38:53,928
No, I just don't want anything
to happen to Wheeler.

608
00:38:53,928 --> 00:38:54,996
Why can't
I take the car?

609
00:38:54,996 --> 00:38:57,732
Because if they nail you, we need
the car to get to the plane.

610
00:38:57,932 --> 00:39:00,902
- The place is crawlin' with cops.
- You're getting' paid, ain't ya?

611
00:39:00,902 --> 00:39:04,205
- Yeah.
- You can't say it ain't enough.

612
00:39:05,406 --> 00:39:06,707
I'll be back.

613
00:39:07,207 --> 00:39:11,378
Johnny. Look. Nice and steady
just like you wanted it.

614
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,755
Open the curtain.

615
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,963
Trap.
Big beautiful booby-trap.

616
00:39:32,631 --> 00:39:34,934
You can't do this.
You can't do it.

617
00:39:39,772 --> 00:39:43,809
You're wrong lady...
Take a look...

618
00:39:48,313 --> 00:39:50,048
Go on take a look.

619
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:06,030
I can do it and
I'm going to do it.

620
00:40:07,231 --> 00:40:09,199
But you're an American citizen.

621
00:40:09,433 --> 00:40:14,137
Sure. And at 5:01, I'm gonna' be
a very rich American citizen.

622
00:40:14,137 --> 00:40:16,239
- You'll never get away with it.
- Shut up.

623
00:40:18,909 --> 00:40:21,011
- I got a stomach ache.
- Take a pill.

624
00:40:21,277 --> 00:40:23,880
Maybe the old man's right,
Johnny. It's a terrible thing.

625
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,149
Turn it off, will 'ya.
Just another man, a man.

626
00:40:26,149 --> 00:40:27,550
But the president.

627
00:40:29,752 --> 00:40:33,556
Yeah, yeah, I never killed
a president before.

628
00:40:36,926 --> 00:40:38,961
- Who's that?
- It's Jud Kelly.

629
00:40:38,961 --> 00:40:41,396
Ellen sent for him to come
and fix the television,

630
00:40:41,396 --> 00:40:43,031
so the boy could
watch the ball game.

631
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:44,132
Why didn't you tell me?

632
00:40:44,132 --> 00:40:47,936
We simply forgot. He's a harmless boy,
Baron. Don't hurt him.

633
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:50,872
- OK. But if you cross me.
- He won't, he won't.

634
00:40:52,907 --> 00:40:55,109
Alright Pop,
you've got the ball.

635
00:40:57,979 --> 00:40:59,747
Let him in, but watch it.

636
00:41:00,548 --> 00:41:03,050
Ellen, we got to
keep this man talking.

637
00:41:03,484 --> 00:41:04,351
Why?

638
00:41:04,351 --> 00:41:07,821
Because that's his weakness.
Sooner or later he'll drop his guard.

639
00:41:07,821 --> 00:41:10,257
We've gotta' find
a way to get Pop's gun.

640
00:41:10,791 --> 00:41:12,693
- Hi Pop, what's new?
- Hello Jud.

641
00:41:12,693 --> 00:41:14,728
I'd better fix your rig,
before you execute yourself.

642
00:41:14,728 --> 00:41:16,163
Come on in.

643
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:20,133
- Tod, what happened to you?
- Ask him?

644
00:41:20,133 --> 00:41:23,670
Same thing that'll happen to you,
unless you do exactly as you're told.

645
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:27,874
- You're kiddin'. Is that real?
- It's real, alright.

646
00:41:28,207 --> 00:41:29,942
- What's your name?
- Jud Kelly.

647
00:41:29,942 --> 00:41:33,045
- What are you doing here?
- I came to fix the television set.

648
00:41:33,045 --> 00:41:35,347
Drop it.
Alright Bart, case him.

649
00:41:36,682 --> 00:41:40,552
I don't have any dough, if that's
what you want. Is this a stick-up?

650
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,422
Yeah, that's right,
it's a stick-up.

651
00:41:43,422 --> 00:41:44,856
You'll never get
away with it.

652
00:41:44,856 --> 00:41:47,792
Go over and sit down, buster.
Take your luggage with you.

653
00:41:47,993 --> 00:41:49,461
You too sit down.

654
00:41:53,565 --> 00:41:58,536
I don't dig it. Did they rob the bank?
What's the gun for? What's goin' on?

655
00:41:59,337 --> 00:42:00,571
- Where's your store?
- Main Street.

656
00:42:00,571 --> 00:42:01,772
- Who runs it?
- Just me.

657
00:42:01,772 --> 00:42:04,475
- All alone?
- Do you have to point that gun at me?

658
00:42:04,475 --> 00:42:05,976
- Alone?
- Answer him.

659
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:06,911
Yeah.

660
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:10,314
You locked up when you left?
Nobody knows you were comin' here?

661
00:42:10,314 --> 00:42:14,618
That's right. Just a service call.
That gun makes me nervous, Mr.

662
00:42:14,885 --> 00:42:18,455
I'm not gonna' be a hero,
you can put the gun away.

663
00:42:18,455 --> 00:42:23,927
Sure, but I'm telling you, buster, like the
others, one pass and the kid gets it.

664
00:42:26,796 --> 00:42:31,634
That's right, he gets it. So you see
his life depends on you. Got it?

665
00:42:31,634 --> 00:42:32,735
Yeah.

666
00:42:35,037 --> 00:42:39,975
- Wilson? Carney back yet?
- No, he's been gone a long time.

667
00:42:54,422 --> 00:42:57,191
Maybe we ought to load the gun now
to be sure, huh?

668
00:42:57,191 --> 00:42:59,827
No, that's just
what the sheriff would like.

669
00:43:00,361 --> 00:43:02,163
Forget about me,
I've had it.

670
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:06,400
Don't con me, sheriff. The minute this
gun was loaded, one of you brave boys

671
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,737
might decide to go for the ride,
just to fire it and if you did,

672
00:43:09,737 --> 00:43:12,806
it might alert a few state cops down
there and the game would be over.

673
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:17,110
- You got any food in the house?
- Course I have.

674
00:43:17,777 --> 00:43:19,579
I'm gonna' grab
a bite, Bart. Watch 'em.

675
00:43:19,579 --> 00:43:22,282
Bring me a little glass of milk will you,
Johnny? My ulcer's murdering me.

676
00:43:22,482 --> 00:43:24,751
Just watch 'em Bart.
Watch 'em.

677
00:43:27,987 --> 00:43:32,325
- I don't dig it, will somebody tell me...
- Sit down, be quiet.

678
00:43:51,776 --> 00:43:54,045
Haven't you any
feelings at all?

679
00:43:54,312 --> 00:44:00,918
No I haven't lady, they were taken out
of me by experts... Feelings are a trap.

680
00:44:00,918 --> 00:44:04,588
Show me a guy with feelings
and I'll show you a sucker.

681
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:09,259
It's a weakness. Makes you think
of something besides yourself.

682
00:44:10,661 --> 00:44:14,765
If I had any feelings left in me at all,
they'd be for me. Just me.

683
00:44:15,132 --> 00:44:17,634
Don't you ever think
of your mother? Your father?

684
00:44:17,634 --> 00:44:21,938
Think of 'em? I used to
think of them a great deal.

685
00:44:25,408 --> 00:44:32,014
My mother wasn't married. My old man
was a dipso. They left me in a home.

686
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:40,322
- You stink.
- Johnny!

687
00:44:40,322 --> 00:44:42,191
Pidge! Come back here.

688
00:44:42,558 --> 00:44:43,859
- The kid.
- Hold it.

689
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:45,260
Pidge, Pidge.

690
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,328
Get him.

691
00:44:46,328 --> 00:44:47,963
Stick 'em up,
or I'll blast you.

692
00:44:48,897 --> 00:44:51,800
- Nice going, Bart.
- It's only a cap pistol.

693
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,702
- I gave it to him myself.
- Don't you touch her, don't you.

694
00:44:58,106 --> 00:45:00,908
I oughta' beat his brains out.
The little... What's so funny?

695
00:45:00,908 --> 00:45:03,678
You should've seen
your face, a cap pistol.

696
00:45:03,678 --> 00:45:05,045
Go ahead,
laugh yourself sick.

697
00:45:05,045 --> 00:45:07,848
That's a pretty good model,
they make 'em real today, don't they?

698
00:45:07,848 --> 00:45:09,850
Here you are, Pidge,
blow his brains out...

699
00:45:11,485 --> 00:45:15,355
Couple of big, bold, bad men, getting'
scared to death by a six-bit cap pistol.

700
00:45:15,355 --> 00:45:17,057
I oughta' beat that kid.

701
00:45:17,057 --> 00:45:18,859
I'm not sure
that he couldn't take 'ya.

702
00:45:19,392 --> 00:45:22,695
Go put some milk on your ulcer
and bring me a piece of the cake.

703
00:45:22,695 --> 00:45:24,931
I need some milk;
the pain's pretty bad.

704
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:26,866
Where's Benny?
Why don't we hear from Benny?

705
00:45:29,202 --> 00:45:30,203
Sit.

706
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,543
If this isn't a stick-up,
what is it?

707
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:40,345
Did you come up here
to fix a television set, junior?

708
00:45:40,345 --> 00:45:42,481
- Yeah.
- Well then, fix the television set.

709
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,449
Tod, what's going on?

710
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:46,385
They're planning to assassinate
the President, Jud.

711
00:45:46,852 --> 00:45:47,619
Which president?

712
00:45:47,986 --> 00:45:50,655
The President of the United States.
He arrives here this afternoon.

713
00:45:50,655 --> 00:45:51,890
You're kidding!

714
00:45:53,558 --> 00:45:57,261
No, you're not kidding.
The president?

715
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:03,901
Kill the president? They can't,
they couldn't do a thing like that.

716
00:46:04,502 --> 00:46:06,937
They're stinking traitors.
They're Benedict Arnolds.

717
00:46:06,937 --> 00:46:10,007
Are you guys crazy?
You can't do a thing like that.

718
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,176
- Sit down, reckless.
- Don't you realise what that means?

719
00:46:13,176 --> 00:46:16,346
That's assassination;
he's your President too.

720
00:46:16,646 --> 00:46:19,849
Make a deal with 'ya boy.
We kill you instead of the President.

721
00:46:19,849 --> 00:46:24,420
That's even steven. Okay with you?
Thought not. Anybody else wanna'

722
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,289
take the heat
off the President?

723
00:46:26,289 --> 00:46:29,625
- How about you sheriff?
- It's a bad joke, Baron.

724
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:31,194
Anybody else wanna' volunteer?

725
00:46:31,194 --> 00:46:33,295
They're commies;
they're enemy agents.

726
00:46:36,165 --> 00:46:41,804
- Alright, who is behind it Baron?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

727
00:46:41,804 --> 00:46:45,474
- What's in it for you?
- You're curious, aren't you sheriff?

728
00:46:45,474 --> 00:46:46,708
While I last.

729
00:46:47,843 --> 00:46:51,079
I like you sheriff. You've got guts.
You must have been a good soldier.

730
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:52,213
I got by.

731
00:46:52,847 --> 00:46:54,849
- I won a Silver Star.
- That's pretty good.

732
00:46:54,849 --> 00:46:58,319
- Killed 27 Jerries all by myself.
- You're a born killer, that's all.

733
00:46:58,753 --> 00:46:59,554
Yeah.

734
00:46:59,921 --> 00:47:01,956
When you get real good
at something, you're a murderer.

735
00:47:03,457 --> 00:47:05,793
Yeah, over there you can knock over
a whole platoon, or a guy invents

736
00:47:05,793 --> 00:47:09,496
a bomb and kills 100000 people, just
like that and maybe gets more medals.

737
00:47:09,763 --> 00:47:11,965
Here you put a slug
in a double-crossing squirt

738
00:47:11,965 --> 00:47:14,668
that isn't even worth burying
and you have to take the gas.

739
00:47:14,868 --> 00:47:18,472
I got no feeling against the President;
I'm just earning a living.

740
00:47:18,472 --> 00:47:19,606
By treason.

741
00:47:19,606 --> 00:47:22,675
Ace shoots craps. Don't give me
that politics jazz, it's not my racket.

742
00:47:22,675 --> 00:47:24,677
I don't even know who's paying me
and I don't want to know.

743
00:47:24,677 --> 00:47:25,812
What's the difference?

744
00:47:25,812 --> 00:47:28,047
Didn't it occur to you
why they want you to do it?

745
00:47:28,247 --> 00:47:32,585
Yes, but that makes them suckers not
me. I'm the guy, who's gettin' it made.

746
00:47:32,585 --> 00:47:37,656
Listen sheriff, a man can stand only for
so much. Before the war, I drifted

747
00:47:37,656 --> 00:47:43,629
and drifted and ran, always lost
in a big crowd. I hated that crowd.

748
00:47:43,629 --> 00:47:47,432
I used to dream about
the crowd once in a while.

749
00:47:47,432 --> 00:47:53,071
I used to see all those faces scratchin'
and shovin' and bitin' and then the mist

750
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:56,574
would clear and somehow
all those faces would be me.

751
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:59,410
All me and all nothin'.

752
00:48:00,311 --> 00:48:02,380
But the war changed everything,
eh Baron?

753
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:07,651
I'm no traitor, sheriff.
I won a Silver Star.

754
00:48:08,786 --> 00:48:10,320
And learned how to kill.

755
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:17,494
Yeah, maybe I did.
Maybe that changed everything.

756
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:21,064
Maybe people began
to know who I was.

757
00:48:22,732 --> 00:48:25,635
After the show, I hooked up
with an outfit for good dough.

758
00:48:25,935 --> 00:48:29,939
The finger said where and how much
and Johnny Baron did the job.

759
00:48:31,107 --> 00:48:34,176
You think anybody else could handle
it? Like Benny or Wheeler without me?

760
00:48:34,176 --> 00:48:35,411
You're talkin' too
much, Johnny.

761
00:48:35,411 --> 00:48:38,480
Nobody else can do this job,
because they've got too much feeling

762
00:48:39,381 --> 00:48:41,150
and feeling's
no good.

763
00:48:42,584 --> 00:48:44,653
I got nothing against
the President, sheriff.

764
00:48:44,987 --> 00:48:48,557
He's just worth half a million
bucks to me, tax- free.

765
00:48:50,458 --> 00:48:52,961
Makin' my own laws
about the taxes too, Pop.

766
00:48:53,728 --> 00:48:55,430
- The guy is goofy.
- Shut up, Jud.

767
00:48:56,831 --> 00:49:01,035
Listen to him, buster. And
don't ever say that again. Ever!

768
00:49:04,105 --> 00:49:11,111
You heard him, Jud.
A half million dollars, huh?

769
00:49:12,179 --> 00:49:17,617
Yeah, that's a lot of scratch, sheriff.
A man could retire on that amount.

770
00:49:17,851 --> 00:49:20,553
- How do you know it will ever be paid?
- Half of it's been paid.

771
00:49:20,553 --> 00:49:23,289
- And the rest?
- I'll get it.

772
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:27,527
I wouldn't be sure. It's not just
a man; it's the President.

773
00:49:27,927 --> 00:49:29,429
That's what's so funny.

774
00:49:30,429 --> 00:49:32,198
The laugh is on the guys
who're paying the freight.

775
00:49:32,198 --> 00:49:35,201
All this loot and they don't
even know what they're doing.

776
00:49:35,534 --> 00:49:39,338
Half a million clams for absolutely
nothing, because tonight at 5pm,

777
00:49:39,338 --> 00:49:43,408
I kill the president and at 5:01
there's a new president.

778
00:49:43,408 --> 00:49:49,014
What changes? Nothing.
What are they paying for? Nothing.

779
00:49:49,881 --> 00:49:52,083
Otherwise I wouldn't have
taken the job, sheriff.

780
00:49:52,083 --> 00:49:53,251
You'd have taken it.

781
00:49:54,953 --> 00:49:55,620
You think so?

782
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,721
- Yeah.
- Why?

783
00:50:03,527 --> 00:50:05,996
Alright, take it easy.
Come on, lady.

784
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,702
Do as you're told
and everything will be fine.

785
00:50:12,402 --> 00:50:15,339
Answer straight,
clean and plain. Answer it.

786
00:50:18,842 --> 00:50:19,843
Hello.

787
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:22,345
Mrs Benson,
let me speak to the chief.

788
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:23,646
Benny?

789
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:25,848
Yeah, train's on time,

790
00:50:26,082 --> 00:50:29,185
the car will be waiting in front of the
station like you figured, facing you.

791
00:50:29,886 --> 00:50:32,021
Fine, get back as soon as you can
and don't be followed.

792
00:50:32,021 --> 00:50:32,888
Check.

793
00:50:55,843 --> 00:50:59,480
There's the big boy's car now.
Lovely target.

794
00:51:00,414 --> 00:51:07,354
- Hey, hold it Mister.
- Yes officer, what is it?

795
00:51:07,354 --> 00:51:10,591
- What's your name?
- Fred, Fred Whitaker.

796
00:51:10,591 --> 00:51:13,594
- What are you doing in town?
- Just passing through.

797
00:51:13,594 --> 00:51:14,661
Where's your car?

798
00:51:14,661 --> 00:51:17,964
I don't have one. I hitch-hiked in from
Three Rivers, waiting for the train out.

799
00:51:17,964 --> 00:51:19,566
I figured I'd take
the train on to L.A.

800
00:51:19,566 --> 00:51:22,302
- What train?
- The five o'clock.

801
00:51:22,302 --> 00:51:26,506
- The five o'clock. Now that's strange.
- Why Officer?

802
00:51:26,506 --> 00:51:29,542
Because we don't have any
5pm train that stops here Mister,

803
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:33,846
except today and that happens to be
a special, you don't know about.

804
00:51:33,846 --> 00:51:39,785
- Except that you do.
- Must be some mistake.

805
00:51:39,785 --> 00:51:41,253
You made it.

806
00:51:42,354 --> 00:51:47,859
Oh, now look officer, I got
identification. I can prove who I am.

807
00:51:48,093 --> 00:51:50,862
I got my drivers
licence right here.

808
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:55,099
Come on.

809
00:52:03,274 --> 00:52:04,008
Gunfire!

810
00:52:52,354 --> 00:52:53,621
Hold it, don't shoot him...

811
00:53:02,396 --> 00:53:04,565
- I told you not to kill him.
- Not to kill him? After he...

812
00:53:04,565 --> 00:53:06,667
He was our only link.
Come on.

813
00:53:14,141 --> 00:53:17,077
- So long, Benny.
- Do you think they got him?

814
00:53:17,077 --> 00:53:18,311
I only hope he's dead.

815
00:53:18,512 --> 00:53:20,013
- Haggerty.
- Yes sir.

816
00:53:20,213 --> 00:53:22,148
We got him.
Dead unfortunately.

817
00:53:22,816 --> 00:53:25,084
Wasn't Carney's last checkpoint
the house on the hill?

818
00:53:25,084 --> 00:53:28,154
Yes, he went there with the sheriff to
check the White Springs ranch about 2.

819
00:53:28,154 --> 00:53:29,288
We haven't been able
to reach them.

820
00:53:29,288 --> 00:53:30,790
Take two troopers
and back track 'em.

821
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:33,292
Start with the house on the hill.
We've got to find Carney.

822
00:53:33,292 --> 00:53:34,126
Right.

823
00:53:37,296 --> 00:53:40,733
Now we got trouble. Everybody
except Mrs Benson, in the cellar.

824
00:53:41,033 --> 00:53:43,602
- What are you gonna' do?
- Nothing, I hope. Move.

825
00:53:45,804 --> 00:53:48,373
Anybody gets brave, kill 'em all.
You can only hang once.

826
00:54:01,319 --> 00:54:02,453
Pidge, stay up there.

827
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:08,626
Now look. Get a grip on yourself.
I want you to look relaxed.

828
00:54:08,893 --> 00:54:11,562
If you don't pull this off,
everybody is dead. Understand?

829
00:54:11,895 --> 00:54:13,864
All of us dead.
So be yourself.

830
00:54:13,864 --> 00:54:14,898
I don't know what you mean.

831
00:54:14,898 --> 00:54:16,967
They'll come up here to check whether
Carney and the sheriff were here

832
00:54:16,967 --> 00:54:19,336
and I want you to go out front.
I don't want 'em in the house.

833
00:54:19,336 --> 00:54:21,438
I can't. I don't know how.
I don't know what to say.

834
00:54:21,671 --> 00:54:24,607
Just go out and water the flowers.
Do anything you like, but keep busy...

835
00:54:26,676 --> 00:54:27,810
Lipstick and rouge, quick.

836
00:54:30,046 --> 00:54:31,914
Now listen to me carefully,

837
00:54:32,315 --> 00:54:34,784
they'll come up to check whether
Carney and the sheriff were here.

838
00:54:34,784 --> 00:54:36,185
Certainly they were here.

839
00:54:36,185 --> 00:54:39,421
They came up to check the house,
but at three o'clock they left here.

840
00:54:39,421 --> 00:54:41,590
They went out
on the White Springs ranch road.

841
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:44,993
They took Pop and the kid with 'em
and that's the last you saw of them.

842
00:54:44,993 --> 00:54:47,195
You got it, you got it?

843
00:54:47,195 --> 00:54:48,196
Yes, yes.

844
00:54:49,731 --> 00:54:51,800
You look like a ghost.
Step on it...

845
00:54:54,702 --> 00:54:57,538
Pull it off lady,
or everybody is dead, everybody.

846
00:55:05,679 --> 00:55:06,747
He's getting rattled, Pop.

847
00:55:06,747 --> 00:55:07,815
How do you mean?

848
00:55:08,048 --> 00:55:09,550
He didn't expect Benny to get shot.

849
00:55:10,184 --> 00:55:11,318
Got anything in mind?

850
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:13,587
Maybe, now listen.

851
00:55:13,587 --> 00:55:14,688
Shut up you guys.

852
00:55:18,525 --> 00:55:19,192
Mrs Benson?

853
00:55:19,192 --> 00:55:20,260
Yes.

854
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:21,461
My name's Haggerty.

855
00:55:21,995 --> 00:55:23,830
Then you must be one
of Mr. Carney's men.

856
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:24,731
That's right, has he been here?

857
00:55:25,165 --> 00:55:26,799
Haven't seen him since they left.

858
00:55:26,799 --> 00:55:28,267
They came up here
about three o'clock,

859
00:55:28,267 --> 00:55:30,903
to check the house, they said.
I - I don't know why.

860
00:55:30,903 --> 00:55:32,572
Who are they?

861
00:55:32,572 --> 00:55:34,640
Why, Mr Carney and Sheriff Shaw.

862
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,308
Then they said they had to check
the White Springs ranch road.

863
00:55:36,308 --> 00:55:37,776
Is your father-in-law
Mr. Benson here?

864
00:55:37,776 --> 00:55:41,613
Well no. No he isn't.

865
00:55:42,648 --> 00:55:44,883
You see he used
to be Mr. Carney's chief.

866
00:55:44,883 --> 00:55:46,184
Yes, I know.

867
00:55:46,752 --> 00:55:49,321
So Mr. Carney took him along.
My little boy too.

868
00:55:49,921 --> 00:55:50,855
Then you're alone?

869
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:52,390
Yes.

870
00:55:53,958 --> 00:55:56,060
And you haven't heard from them
since they left?

871
00:55:56,327 --> 00:56:00,098
No, no I haven't. Something's wrong.
I know something's wrong.

872
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:04,802
No, no Mrs Benson, nothing's wrong.
We're, we're just checking that's all.

873
00:56:05,603 --> 00:56:07,638
But if you see
or hear from them before I do,

874
00:56:07,638 --> 00:56:09,773
please have them check the detail
down at the railroad station,

875
00:56:09,773 --> 00:56:11,508
it's very important. Thanks.

876
00:56:14,645 --> 00:56:16,413
Alright lady, inside...

877
00:56:22,986 --> 00:56:23,853
Come on, come on.

878
00:56:27,924 --> 00:56:31,027
Very nice, very nice job.
Congratulations.

879
00:56:33,462 --> 00:56:34,930
You don't like me, do you?

880
00:56:36,999 --> 00:56:40,135
- You're an animal.
- I don't like you either.

881
00:56:40,536 --> 00:56:43,238
Animals kill each other to live,
that's what you're doing.

882
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:47,376
How do you like your roast beef?
Medium rare or well done?

883
00:56:52,247 --> 00:56:54,315
Alright, Bart, run 'em in.
It's clear.

884
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:03,057
- I wish you were dead.
- You haven't got the guts.

885
00:57:04,992 --> 00:57:09,530
- Just give me a chance.
- Here's your chance.

886
00:57:12,299 --> 00:57:16,937
Go ahead, take it, but remember
the squirt in the cellar...

887
00:57:27,513 --> 00:57:30,817
That's right
think of the President first.

888
00:57:32,952 --> 00:57:37,289
Let's not think of ourselves.
I didn't give you a whole chance,

889
00:57:37,923 --> 00:57:40,259
but you didn't even take
a half a chance.

890
00:57:50,035 --> 00:57:51,369
Everything okay, Johnny?

891
00:57:51,603 --> 00:57:55,206
Sure, everything's fine.
She played her part real good.

892
00:57:55,573 --> 00:58:00,912
She should be on television. You,
didn't I tell you to fix the television set?

893
00:58:01,245 --> 00:58:02,213
You told me to sit.

894
00:58:02,213 --> 00:58:04,915
Get your stuff and fix it.
It'll keep you from getting patriotic.

895
00:58:04,915 --> 00:58:07,451
If I don't do something,
I'll blow my top just sitting here.

896
00:58:07,451 --> 00:58:10,554
Fix the set and shut your mouth.
I don't like what you say.

897
00:58:10,554 --> 00:58:13,257
Now fix it,
we've still got time...

898
00:58:17,761 --> 00:58:18,695
All yours...

899
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:26,870
Open 'em...

900
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,949
About 200 yards.

901
00:58:42,985 --> 00:58:46,154
- Baron. Isn't that a German rifle?
- Yeah. You know it?

902
00:58:46,154 --> 00:58:49,257
I know it. Where were
you during the war?

903
00:58:50,192 --> 00:58:54,029
All the way from the Kasserine Pass.
I won a Silver Star. Where were you?

904
00:58:54,029 --> 00:58:57,765
Normandy to the Elbe by way of the
Bulge. You get up into Germany?

905
00:58:57,966 --> 00:59:01,803
No. Bet you were one of those big shot
guys with the gold bar on the shoulder.

906
00:59:01,803 --> 00:59:04,171
No, no I was a corporal.
How about you?

907
00:59:04,171 --> 00:59:07,842
- Corporal? I made sergeant.
- You didn't like officers?

908
00:59:08,409 --> 00:59:13,514
Officers, big shots. Yes sir,
no sir, salute sir. Big shots.

909
00:59:13,714 --> 00:59:18,018
- You don't like big shots?
- Not when you're bigger, sheriff.

910
00:59:18,018 --> 00:59:21,421
I killed more Jerries than
any five officers put together.

911
00:59:21,621 --> 00:59:24,758
I did some pretty good chopping
in the war. Pretty good.

912
00:59:24,758 --> 00:59:27,427
Like I said before,
you're a born killer. That's all.

913
00:59:27,727 --> 00:59:32,498
Yeah, they taught me how and I liked it.
Ha, my C.O. Used to stand there

914
00:59:32,498 --> 00:59:34,267
and shake
like a leaf while I chopped.

915
00:59:34,267 --> 00:59:35,434
If more guys like me had to...

916
00:59:35,434 --> 00:59:38,504
Tell me one thing, Baron.
How come you missed Germany?

917
00:59:38,938 --> 00:59:40,773
They sent me home,
my tour was finished.

918
00:59:40,773 --> 00:59:43,876
Your tour? In the infantry?
Are you kiddin'?

919
00:59:44,309 --> 00:59:47,045
You finish your tour in the infantry
when they plant you in a box.

920
00:59:47,412 --> 00:59:49,848
- Tour! That was for the air corp.
- Turn it off.

921
00:59:49,848 --> 00:59:52,517
- Yeah, you probably went over the hill.
- I said, turn if off.

922
00:59:52,517 --> 00:59:56,087
You know, Baron, you got the yard look.
You look yard bird to me.

923
00:59:56,087 --> 00:59:57,355
I'm tellin' you, sheriff. Turn it off.

924
00:59:57,355 --> 00:59:59,957
Big shot with the yard birds,
eh? Come on now, tell me.

925
00:59:59,957 --> 01:00:03,761
Where were you court-martialled?
What was it for? Rape?

926
01:00:03,961 --> 01:00:06,230
No, not rape. Killing,
that's what you like, killing.

927
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:08,365
Maybe shooting down
unarmed PW's.

928
01:00:08,365 --> 01:00:10,067
Sit down and shut up.

929
01:00:10,834 --> 01:00:16,173
Ah, but by golly you got away with it.
So... I got it. Section eight.

930
01:00:16,607 --> 01:00:19,276
You went out on a section eight.
Section eight.

931
01:00:19,276 --> 01:00:23,179
Psycho in charge of killing, eh?
You know, I knew guys like you.

932
01:00:23,179 --> 01:00:26,382
Killing was sweet.
Rather kill a man than love a girl.

933
01:00:26,616 --> 01:00:29,519
- A real kick. A thrill with the guts.
- Stop it, Tod. Stop it.

934
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:31,754
Or maybe you didn't like your C.O.
Maybe you shot him in the back.

935
01:00:31,754 --> 01:00:34,223
That it?
Maybe you... Aaagh!

936
01:00:37,226 --> 01:00:39,862
Like I said, shut up.

937
01:00:46,868 --> 01:00:53,141
- Tod darling, it's hopeless.
- No, no it's not five o'clock yet.

938
01:00:55,243 --> 01:00:56,978
Gonna' keep your trap shut?

939
01:00:56,978 --> 01:00:58,012
Yeah.

940
01:00:58,379 --> 01:00:59,380
Hurts, huh?

941
01:00:59,981 --> 01:01:00,782
It hurts.

942
01:01:01,149 --> 01:01:03,584
Well I can keep kickin', as long
as you keep shootin' your face off.

943
01:01:03,584 --> 01:01:04,619
I know.

944
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:09,323
Pop, you were right when you blew
the power tube. I have one here.

945
01:01:09,823 --> 01:01:11,258
I'll have it perkin',
in a second.

946
01:01:11,525 --> 01:01:13,260
You know,
I was thinking Jud.

947
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:17,130
If you were to clamp the main plate lead
to a good ground like that table there,

948
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:19,733
you'd get a better picture.
A lot of lines in it now.

949
01:01:21,067 --> 01:01:25,338
Clamp the main plate lead to the table.
Cut the static lines.

950
01:01:25,605 --> 01:01:29,609
Expert. First he wrecks the set,
then he tells the kid how to fix it.

951
01:01:29,609 --> 01:01:31,210
Main plate lead...

952
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:38,284
Yeah.

953
01:01:41,687 --> 01:01:44,123
That's right, Jud, all it needs
is a high potential ground.

954
01:01:44,123 --> 01:01:46,225
We're a long way from
the broadcasting station.

955
01:01:46,225 --> 01:01:47,559
What are you guys
yapping about?

956
01:01:47,559 --> 01:01:49,694
Technical talk, mister.
I'm an old radio man.

957
01:01:49,694 --> 01:01:51,496
Battleship New York,
World War One.

958
01:01:51,763 --> 01:01:53,465
Gramps beat the Germans,
single-handed.

959
01:01:53,465 --> 01:01:55,700
Not exactly son,
but I was there at Scapa Flow

960
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:57,135
when the German
fleet surrendered.

961
01:01:57,135 --> 01:02:00,104
Alright, alright, stop the bulling
and fix that set will ya.

962
01:02:00,338 --> 01:02:01,439
Yes sir.

963
01:02:02,206 --> 01:02:04,875
- Oh!
- Dad, Dad what is it?

964
01:02:05,109 --> 01:02:06,877
- Pain, bad.
- What hit him?

965
01:02:07,144 --> 01:02:08,345
He has a bad heart.

966
01:02:08,345 --> 01:02:10,047
Pidge, my pills,
top drawer of the bureau.

967
01:02:10,347 --> 01:02:13,484
- I'll get 'em.
- You stay put. The kid'll get 'em.

968
01:02:39,642 --> 01:02:41,777
Pidge, put down that gun and
get some water for your grandfather.

969
01:02:41,777 --> 01:02:42,845
But mom, listen.

970
01:02:43,312 --> 01:02:44,513
You heard me, Pidge.

971
01:02:46,348 --> 01:02:46,974
OK.

972
01:02:52,387 --> 01:02:55,890
You know what I think, Pop. I got a
feeling your heart attack's a phony.

973
01:02:56,157 --> 01:02:57,058
Pain's bad.

974
01:02:57,058 --> 01:03:00,061
I'm warning you, if you're trying to pull
something, you'd better watch it.

975
01:03:00,061 --> 01:03:01,195
Baron, I've been thinking.

976
01:03:01,195 --> 01:03:03,364
You've been thinking you'd like
to take a crack at this rifle.

977
01:03:03,364 --> 01:03:05,232
Do you think I'd
wanna' get myself killed?

978
01:03:05,232 --> 01:03:08,302
Yes. Frankly, sheriff I don't think
you'd mind getting yourself killed.

979
01:03:08,803 --> 01:03:10,304
Nobody wants to die.

980
01:03:10,304 --> 01:03:12,239
Do we have to talk about it?
Why don't you shut up?

981
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:15,209
- No guts.
- It gets on my nerves, that's all.

982
01:03:15,209 --> 01:03:17,577
Now why would I want
to get myself killed?

983
01:03:17,577 --> 01:03:19,780
Because it's five minutes
to five and a shot might bring

984
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:22,849
those state troopers stormin' all over
the joint before the President arrives.

985
01:03:23,183 --> 01:03:26,886
Sheriff, I can put you away in two
seconds by twisting your arm again.

986
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:30,923
That way there's no noise. So don't
go winning any post-mortem medals.

987
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:33,492
I wouldn't enjoy winning
a post-mortem medal

988
01:03:33,492 --> 01:03:36,329
any more than you're gonna'
enjoy that post-mortem money.

989
01:03:36,329 --> 01:03:37,196
- What did you say?
- What did he say?

990
01:03:37,196 --> 01:03:39,498
I said nobody ever made it.
You won't either.

991
01:03:42,301 --> 01:03:43,535
You don't think so?

992
01:03:45,337 --> 01:03:48,006
So you got a plane. You'll never
reach it ahead of the police

993
01:03:48,006 --> 01:03:50,041
and if you do you'll never
make it to the border.

994
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:51,943
You ever hear of
the jet fighter?

995
01:03:51,943 --> 01:03:54,479
You know how many airstrips there
are between here and the border?

996
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:57,682
You know a fella' can get an
education just listening to this guy.

997
01:03:57,882 --> 01:03:59,083
Well, maybe he's
right, Johnny.

998
01:03:59,284 --> 01:04:01,252
You said half the money
had already been paid.

999
01:04:01,252 --> 01:04:03,354
A smart guy would hit
the road right now.

1000
01:04:03,354 --> 01:04:06,324
Fly outa here, skip the President,
spend the money in South America.

1001
01:04:06,324 --> 01:04:07,391
Alive.

1002
01:04:07,691 --> 01:04:12,463
He's right, Johnny. Why take the risk?
We can lam now, we can make it.

1003
01:04:12,463 --> 01:04:16,099
We don't have to fool with this. It's too
big, there's something wrong with it.

1004
01:04:16,333 --> 01:04:17,200
Chicken.

1005
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:20,570
Chicken! Alright, fine.
Who wants to be rich and dead?

1006
01:04:21,037 --> 01:04:22,839
They'll get us.
They haven't missed yet, Johnny.

1007
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,507
The guy's right. You've got the loot.

1008
01:04:24,507 --> 01:04:26,810
Let's take off and get outa here for
good. Once we're across the border...

1009
01:04:26,810 --> 01:04:27,810
Hate those craps.

1010
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:30,013
Benny wasn't chicken, they
didn't waste any time on him.

1011
01:04:30,013 --> 01:04:31,948
We haven't got a chance.

1012
01:04:32,281 --> 01:04:37,553
Turn it off, Bart. You're embarrassing
me in front of the Sheriff.

1013
01:04:38,354 --> 01:04:41,590
But Johnny, even if we swing it, he's the
President. They'll never give up.

1014
01:04:41,824 --> 01:04:44,426
You don't figure that the guys
who're paying off, are just gonna'

1015
01:04:44,426 --> 01:04:47,496
let you fly away, do you? They'll be
after you, just like the Secret Service.

1016
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:50,565
I thought of that too, sheriff.

1017
01:04:50,999 --> 01:04:53,535
It might be an internationally
embarrassing situation,

1018
01:04:53,535 --> 01:04:55,770
if the feds happen to
catch up with us first.

1019
01:04:56,204 --> 01:04:59,207
You've gotta' realise Bart that
everybody's gonna' be on your tail;

1020
01:04:59,207 --> 01:05:01,275
from five o'clock
until the day you die.

1021
01:05:02,443 --> 01:05:04,312
There's a hole in
your argument, sheriff.

1022
01:05:04,312 --> 01:05:05,379
What is it?

1023
01:05:05,379 --> 01:05:08,015
We're already wanted for murder.
So you can only take the gas once.

1024
01:05:08,015 --> 01:05:09,850
They'll get us, Johnny.

1025
01:05:12,219 --> 01:05:16,356
- They won't get us Bart. Not us.
- You're sure, Johnny?

1026
01:05:16,356 --> 01:05:19,226
You leave it to me.

1027
01:05:22,596 --> 01:05:24,564
You're sick, mate.
You're sick.

1028
01:05:25,065 --> 01:05:26,566
I don't like that.

1029
01:05:27,133 --> 01:05:29,269
Don't play God, just
because you've got a gun.

1030
01:05:32,171 --> 01:05:34,307
But you see sheriff
that's the way it is.

1031
01:05:34,307 --> 01:05:36,876
When you've got a gun
you are a sort of God.

1032
01:05:37,076 --> 01:05:39,945
If you had the gun, I'd be the
chump and you'd be the God.

1033
01:05:40,746 --> 01:05:43,115
The gun gives you the power
of life and death.

1034
01:05:44,516 --> 01:05:47,019
It's a funny sort of feeling to
have control of life and death.

1035
01:05:47,486 --> 01:05:49,454
You must have had it
during the war.

1036
01:05:50,122 --> 01:05:52,657
You could miss a man
if you had a mind to.

1037
01:05:53,058 --> 01:05:55,460
Or you could kill him
dead in his tracks.

1038
01:05:55,693 --> 01:05:59,497
And that made you a
kinda' God, and I liked it.

1039
01:06:00,498 --> 01:06:05,202
Without the gun I'm nothing, and I
never had anything before I got one.

1040
01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:09,707
First time I got one in my hands and
killed a man, I got some self-respect.

1041
01:06:10,741 --> 01:06:12,142
I was somebody.

1042
01:06:13,577 --> 01:06:15,646
Like this kid over here.

1043
01:06:15,646 --> 01:06:18,548
If that cap pistol was a real gun
and I didn't have a gun,

1044
01:06:18,548 --> 01:06:21,818
he'd be a kind of a God too
and if I wanted my life,

1045
01:06:21,818 --> 01:06:24,321
I'd worship the ground he walks on

1046
01:06:24,321 --> 01:06:26,990
and I'd pay him the half a million
dollars for my life.

1047
01:06:28,458 --> 01:06:30,393
Because life is all I have.

1048
01:06:33,062 --> 01:06:36,699
But the squirt doesn't have the gun,
I have and I can loose the lightening.

1049
01:06:45,541 --> 01:06:47,142
No noise just pictures.

1050
01:06:54,983 --> 01:06:56,151
Oh, butterfingers!

1051
01:07:03,691 --> 01:07:05,860
You're wrong about God
and the gun, sheriff.

1052
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:08,229
Without the gun you would
never have spit at me.

1053
01:07:08,596 --> 01:07:10,297
You would never
have even noticed me.

1054
01:07:10,864 --> 01:07:14,802
But because of the gun you'll
remember me as long as you live.

1055
01:07:29,349 --> 01:07:30,683
Where is it now?

1056
01:07:30,683 --> 01:07:33,219
Blowing for the 66 crossing,
outside town.

1057
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:37,723
Alright, nobody moves.
This is it. You, over there.

1058
01:07:38,724 --> 01:07:40,159
Johnny,
let me see, once.

1059
01:07:40,392 --> 01:07:42,895
We're gonna' do it, Bart.
This is my meat. We're gonna' do it.

1060
01:07:43,128 --> 01:07:43,929
Just to see.

1061
01:07:50,202 --> 01:07:51,269
Return Fire.

1062
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:28,338
Hold your Fire.

1063
01:09:13,047 --> 01:09:14,515
It didn't stop.

1064
01:09:20,887 --> 01:09:22,222
It didn't stop.

1065
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:24,324
It didn't stop!

1066
01:09:37,036 --> 01:09:39,839
No... Don't.

1067
01:09:41,173 --> 01:09:44,710
No! Please, no!

1068
01:09:56,087 --> 01:09:57,755
Are you sure you're going
to be alright, Mr. Benson?

1069
01:09:57,755 --> 01:10:00,191
Oh! Don't worry about me
Mr. Wilson, I'll be alright.

1070
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,626
I don't need any nurse maid.

1071
01:10:02,493 --> 01:10:03,895
We're certainly
grateful to you.

1072
01:10:03,895 --> 01:10:05,663
How come the train went
right through the station?

1073
01:10:05,663 --> 01:10:07,498
We simply cancelled
the stopover.

1074
01:10:07,898 --> 01:10:09,633
We couldn't take a chance
on the President's safety

1075
01:10:09,633 --> 01:10:11,936
once it were proven the
assassins were in town.

1076
01:10:11,936 --> 01:10:13,570
The President went on to
Los Angeles.

1077
01:10:13,570 --> 01:10:14,538
Missed the station, huh?

1078
01:10:14,538 --> 01:10:15,506
I'm afraid so.

1079
01:10:15,506 --> 01:10:18,442
Some day those guys are gonna' start
taking you for amateurs, Mr. Wilson?

1080
01:10:18,675 --> 01:10:20,944
I hope not. Thanks again,
Mr. Benson.

1081
01:10:20,944 --> 01:10:23,113
You too, young man.

1082
01:10:23,113 --> 01:10:27,484
Oh, that's alright. Someday I'm
gonna' be a bodyguard, just like you.

1083
01:10:27,484 --> 01:10:29,619
Nonsense boy. You're gonna'
grow up to be President

1084
01:10:29,619 --> 01:10:31,120
and president's
have bodyguards.

1085
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:32,221
And grandpops?

1086
01:10:32,221 --> 01:10:34,490
And grandpops.
Especially grandpops.

1087
01:10:49,137 --> 01:10:49,938
Ellen.

1088
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:52,073
How's Jud?

1089
01:10:52,807 --> 01:10:54,175
He didn't make it.

1090
01:10:55,877 --> 01:10:56,845
And Slim?

1091
01:10:56,845 --> 01:10:58,813
Critical, but they
think he'll be alright.

1092
01:11:00,515 --> 01:11:02,417
I guess somebody had
to make them stick.

1093
01:11:02,683 --> 01:11:03,818
What?

1094
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:07,355
Something dad said this morning,
about principles.

1095
01:11:08,189 --> 01:11:10,324
Get in Tod;
I'll drive you home.

1096
01:11:11,492 --> 01:11:13,761
No thanks; I've got
to go over to the office.

1097
01:11:16,296 --> 01:11:18,265
Can I pick you up
for church tomorrow?

1098
01:11:23,737 --> 01:11:25,672
Yeah, that'll be swell.

1099
01:11:39,652 --> 01:11:40,619
Say officer.

1100
01:11:40,619 --> 01:11:41,353
Yeah.

1101
01:11:41,353 --> 01:11:42,855
Could you tell me the way
to Three Rivers?

1102
01:11:43,355 --> 01:11:47,292
Ah, you go down to the first intersection,
you turn left, it's about 60 miles.

1103
01:11:47,492 --> 01:11:49,027
Thanks.
What's this town?

1104
01:11:49,027 --> 01:11:49,995
"Suddenly".

1105
01:11:50,395 --> 01:11:51,363
Suddenly, what?

1106
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:53,031
No that's the name.

1107
01:11:53,698 --> 01:11:55,133
That's a funny name
for a town.

1108
01:11:57,602 --> 01:12:02,573
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know about that.
