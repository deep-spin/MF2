1
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,030
(applause)

2
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,210
(applause continues)

3
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,890
<i>Thrice happy he who hides
from pomp and power</i>

4
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,590
<i>in sylvan shade
or solitary bower</i>

5
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,630
<i>where balmy zephyrs
fan his burning cheeks...</i>

6
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,460
- Clown! The king of clowns!
Leave the stage at once!

7
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:44,620
- Who is it?

8
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,570
It's Cyrano.
I was afraid he'd do this.

9
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,250
<i>Thrice happy he
who hides from pomp and power...</i>

10
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,910
- Wretch! Did I not forbid
you to appear this month?

11
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,260
- Let's be quiet.
- Quiet!

12
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,380
- Go on Montfleury.

13
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,400
<i>Thrice happy he who...</i>

14
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,630
- He who, indeed.

15
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,730
- Donkeys say rather Hee-Haw!

16
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,790
Begone!  Or must I come and
help you off the stage myself?

17
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:24,000
What! Still there?

18
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,220
<i>Where balmy zephyrs
fan his burning cheeks... </i>

19
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,050
Fat swine, if you dare breathe
on balmy zephyr more

20
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,640
I'll fan your cheeks
for you!

21
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,480
Monsieur, won't you all
protect me?

22
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,090
- Proceed, proceed.
- Go on.

23
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,880
Sir, I will not allow you
to insult me in this manner.

24
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,520
Really?
What manner would you prefer?

25
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,850
Quiet, down there!

26
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,940
- We'll tolerate
no more of this.

27
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,720
Go on with the play,
Montfleury.

28
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,380
(shouting criticisms)

29
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,480
Unless these gentlemen
retain your seats

30
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,790
my sword may
bite their ribbons.

31
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,650
Who is this braggart?

32
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,070
My cousin, sir.

33
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,710
Well, Montfleury,
still no exit?

34
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,930
- Very well then,
I enter

35
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,740
with knife, to carve
this fat, stuffed goose.

36
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,800
(ominous music begins)

37
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,080
(crowd clamors)

38
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:22,170
I pray, do not crowd
my scabbard here.

39
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,320
She may put her
tongue out at you.

40
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:27,140
(shouted recriminations)

41
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,990
Silence.

42
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,830
I say be silent!

43
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:38,260
And I offer one universal
challenge to you all:

44
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,410
Will all who wish to die,
please raise their hands.

45
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,360
Approach, young heroes.
I will take your names.

46
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,830
To the first man who falls
I'll build a monument.

47
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,710
Who will head the list?

48
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:50,780
You, sir?

49
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,000
No.

50
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:53,610
You?

51
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,170
No, no.

52
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,770
Anyone?

53
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,600
Anyone at all?

54
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,550
Not one...name?

55
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,420
Not one finger?

56
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,260
Very well then,
I go on.

57
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,810
Attend to me, Full Moon.

58
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,190
I clap my hands three times, thus.

59
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,740
(three claps)

60
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,320
At the third, you will...
eclipse yourself.

61
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:31,390
Ready!

62
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:32,910
One.

63
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:34,900
(clap)

64
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,070
How dare you.

65
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,210
I demand!

66
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,070
I insist.

67
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,150
- I call upon all the nobles...
- Two!

68
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:42,080
(clap)

69
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,090
This is an outrage.

70
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,040
You hear, an outrage.

71
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,620
Nothing on earth
will move me from this stage.

72
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,800
Three!

73
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:49,910
(clap)

74
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,410
(laughter)

75
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,210
Fair ladies and noble gentlemen...
- Boo!

76
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:02,560
(laughter)

77
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,210
But, Monsieur de Bergerac,

78
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:07,490
why have you done this
to our Montfleury, an admirable actor?

79
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,090
I have two reasons,
either one conclusive.

80
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,800
First, he is an
abominable actor,

81
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,870
who mouths his verse
and moans his tragedy.

82
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,630
Second,....

83
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,970
Well, that's my secret.

84
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,280
But...
But you've closed the play!

85
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,880
It is not a very good play.

86
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,970
Huh!
And of their money?

87
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,080
Possibly you would like
that returned to these good people.

88
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:31,960
Yes?

89
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,360
Yes.

90
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,830
Here,...catch!

91
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,920
(crowd murmurs)

92
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:41,960
Well, Monsieur, you are hereby
authorized to close our play every night.

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,200
On these terms.

94
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:43,740
(laughter)

95
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,400
Ladies and gentlemen,
your money will be returned.

96
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,250
Kindly pass out, quietly.

97
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,030
Goodnight, goodnight.

98
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,220
(crowd accepts
in good spirits)

99
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,120
(until...)

100
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,610
Your cousin is an
extraordinary man, Madame.

101
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:04,080
Oh, I agree.

102
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,550
Soldier, poet, philosopher,
musician, playwright.

103
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,570
All those?

104
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,360
Yes, and the best
swordsman in Paris.

105
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,310
Really?

106
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,060
Now, I should have thought
the Vicomte here had that honor.

107
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,360
Tell me, Madame, that
comic mask, that nose,

108
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,300
presently he will take it off?

109
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,950
No, Monsieur, he keeps it.

110
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:29,350
And heaven help
the man who smiles.

111
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,060
Good night.

112
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,880
Oh, Monsieur!

113
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,980
Monsieur!

114
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,710
Uh, when do you leave Paris?

115
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,100
Sir?

116
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,280
Why, after what you've
just done to Montfleury,

117
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,750
did you not know that
the Compte de Guiche was his patron?

118
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,190
Who's yours?

119
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,140
No one.

120
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:52,940
No one?

121
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:53,870
No patron?

122
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,630
I said not.

123
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,900
But the Compte de Guiche
has a long arm.

124
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,900
Mine is longer
by three feet of steel.

125
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,180
Yes, but..

126
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,160
but, what a scare...

127
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:02,990
You may go now.

128
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,510
- but...
- You may go.

129
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:08,620
Well, tell me,
why are you staring at my nose?

130
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,160
Oh, I was not staring.

131
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,630
Does it astonish you?

132
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,920
Why n...Why no, I've been careful
not to look.

133
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,510
Oh, and why not, if you please?

134
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,730
It disgusts you, then?

135
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:17,880
But, no, I just...

136
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,700
Does its color appear
to you unwholesome?

137
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,480
By no means.

138
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,310
Then, possibly you find it
just a trifle large?

139
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,500
No, small, very small, tiny!

140
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,640
Infinitesimal!

141
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,960
What?
You accuse me of absurdity?

142
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,730
Small, my nose?
Why magnificent, my nose!

143
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,900
You pug, you knob,
you button head,

144
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,170
know that I glory
in this nose of mine!

145
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,400
For a great nose
indicates a great man,

146
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:45,440
congenial, courteous,
intellectual, virile, courageous.

147
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,050
Whilst that face of yours,

148
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:54,070
that blank, inglorious concavity
which my right hand finds on top of you,

149
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:59,630
is as devoid of pride, of poetry,
of soul, of picturesqueness,

150
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,810
of contour, of character,
of nose, in short,

151
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:09,740
as that which is at the bottom of
that limp spine of yours my left foot...
- Oh, help!

152
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,550
(laughter)

153
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,840
Presently, this fellow
will grow tiresome.

154
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,590
Oh, he blows his horn.

155
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,800
- Well, will no one
put him in his place?

156
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,660
If you would all me.
Observe.

157
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:31,260
Monsieur, your nose,
your nose is rather large.

158
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,400
Rather?

159
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,350
Oh, well.

160
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,620
Is that all?

161
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,540
Well, of course, you...

162
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:40,400
Ah, no young sir, you're too simple.

163
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,620
Why, you might have
said a great many things.

164
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,800
Why waste your opportunity?

165
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,860
For example, thus...

166
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,450
Aggressive---

167
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:51,040
I, sir, if that great nose were mine,
I would have it amputated on the spot.

168
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,710
Practical---

169
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,570
How do you drink with such a nose.
You must have had a cup made especially.

170
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,880
Descriptive---

171
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,570
'Tis a rock, a crag, a cape.

172
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,510
A cape, say rather, a peninsula.

173
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:06,990
Inquisitive---

174
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:11,400
Uh, what is that receptacle,
a razor case or a portfolio?

175
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,680
Kindly---

176
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,840
Ah, do you love the little birds so much
that when they come and sing to you,

177
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,690
you give them this to perch on?

178
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,570
Cautious---

179
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,120
Take care. A weight like that
might make you top-heavy.

180
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,250
Eloquent---

181
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,510
When it blows the typhoon howls
and the clouds darken.

182
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,400
Dramatic---

183
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,690
When it bleeds...the Red Sea.

184
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,530
Simple---

185
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,640
Eh, when do they
unveil the monument?

186
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,900
Military---

187
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,510
Beware, a secret weapon!

188
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,620
Enterprising---

189
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,080
What a sigh for some perfumer!

190
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,300
Respectful---

191
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,050
Uh sir, I recognize in you
a man of parts,

192
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,740
a man of...prominence.

193
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,500
Or, Literary---

194
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,360
Was this the nose
that launched a thousand ships?

195
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:02,850
These, my dear sir, are things
you might have said had you

196
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,690
some tinge of letters or of wit
to color your discourse.

197
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,970
Bit wit not so.
You never had an atom.

198
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:14,480
And of letters, you need
but three to write you down, a..s..s.

199
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,530
Ass.

200
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,040
- (laughter)
- You, sir!

201
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,600
Dolt! Bumpkin! Fool!

202
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,620
How do you do, and I,
Cyrano Savinien Hercule de Bergerac.

203
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,050
Vicomte, come.

204
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,650
Such arrogance.
This scarecrow who...

205
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,850
Look at him!

206
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:36,120
No ribbons. No lace.
Not even gloves!

207
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,700
True. I carry my adornments
only on my soul.

208
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,860
Decked with deeds
instead of ribbons.

209
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,420
Mantled in my good name,

210
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,350
and crowned with a
white plume of freedom.

211
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,130
But..

212
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,510
But, I have no gloves.

213
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,630
A pity, too.

214
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:51,630
I had one, the last one of an old pair,
and lost that.

215
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,250
Very careless of me.

216
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,750
Some gentleman offered me
an impertinence.

217
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:59,840
I left it in his face.

218
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,840
So be it!

219
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:05,050
You shall die exquisitely

220
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,160
Oh, a poet.

221
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,640
Oh, yes, a poet if you will.

222
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,510
So, uh, while we fight,
I'll improvise a ballad for you,

223
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,270
and as I end the refrain,
...skhrch!...thrust home.

224
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,280
Will you?

225
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,130
I will.

226
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,420
(excited crowd)

227
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,890
Ballad au Duel
at the Theatre de Burgoyne

228
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,320
between de Bergerac,
and uh.....a barbarian.

229
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,240
What do you mean by that?

230
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh, that?

231
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,960
The title.

232
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,570
(laughter)

233
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,200
Stop. Let me choose my rhyme.

234
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,640
So. Here we go.

235
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,070
Lightly I toss my hat away.

236
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,440
Languidly o'er my arm let fall
the cloak that covers my bright array.

237
00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:00,770
Then, out swords,
and to work withal.

238
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,720
A Lancelot in his lady's hall,

239
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,580
A Spartacus at the Hippodrome,

240
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,340
I dally a while with you..

241
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,750
you jackall.

242
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,360
Just as I end the refrain,

243
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,380
thrust home!

244
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,220
Where shall I skewer my peacock again?

245
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,160
Nay, better for you
to have shunned this brawl.

246
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,010
Here in the heart
or your ribbons, gay,

247
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,610
in the belly
'neath you silken shawl?

248
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,130
Now, come my points floats,
light as the foam

249
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,640
ready to drive you
back to the wall,

250
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,030
and then as I end the refrain,

251
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,440
thrust home.

252
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,210
Oh, for a rhyme.

253
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,060
Why, your fight is fading.

254
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,040
You break.

255
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:26,970
You cower.

256
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,600
You cringe.

257
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,200
You crawl.

258
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,740
How can I tell
you're allowed to say

259
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,750
something to turn on my head

260
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,720
forestall.....

261
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,660
Life with a tunny

262
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,970
death with a scall.

263
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,760
Something to turn on my fancy roam,

264
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,670
free for a time till the rhyme's recall,

265
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,620
then as I end the refrain,

266
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,620
thrust home!

267
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:44,670
Refrain.

268
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,960
Prince,
pray God that is Lord of all,

269
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,840
pardon you soul,

270
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,190
for your time has come.

271
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,820
Pass! I fling you aslant, asprawl.

272
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,590
Then as I end the refrain,

273
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,680
thrust home!

274
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,390
(shouts of hurray
and congratulation)

275
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,470
Ladies and gentlemen,
please, please,

276
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,790
not until the performance is over.

277
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:51,980
Close the house.

278
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,820
A strike,

279
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,340
but leave the lights.

280
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,070
We rehearse the new
farce tonight.

281
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,240
Wait.

282
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,570
You have only to watch a fight,

283
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,530
or have you ruined
if you listen to them.

284
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,570
Think of the enemies you've made,

285
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,050
Montfleury, the Vicomte,
if he lives,

286
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,380
all those foppish marquis,
the Comte de Guiche.

287
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,970
That politician.

288
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,910
He's the Cardinal's nephew.
There's power there!

289
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,330
And power here.

290
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:24,680
Young fool!

291
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,540
Take an example from me.

292
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,810
20 years a captain,
while others who know only

293
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,750
how to deploy their
forces at court

294
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,890
now dangle a marshal's baton.

295
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,360
Well, uh, someday
I will avenge you, too.

296
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,530
Impossible.
Come on, let's go to dinner.

297
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,830
Dinner?
No, not I.

298
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,540
Why not?

299
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,530
Because I have no money.

300
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,150
But, the purse of gold.

301
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,140
Farewell paternal pension.

302
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,430
And you have
until the first of next month?

303
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:52,310
Nothing.

304
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,460
What a fool.

305
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,770
Yes, but, what a moment.

306
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,670
- Pardon, Monsieur.

307
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,770
A man ought
never to go hungry.

308
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,150
I have everything here.

309
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:06,360
Please.

310
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,080
My dear child, I cannot bend this Gascon
pride of mine to accept such a kindness.

311
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,820
But, I...

312
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,810
Yet, for fear that
I may give you pain if I refuse,

313
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,190
I will take something.

314
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,660
A grape.

315
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,160
One only.

316
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,170
And a glass of water.

317
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,650
No, clear.

318
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:35,750
And, uh,...half a macaroon.

319
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,100
Nothing more?

320
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,920
Why, yes.

321
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,230
Your hand to kiss.

322
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,510
Thank you, sir.

323
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,100
Good night.

324
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,290
Idiot.

325
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:13,890
Dinner.

326
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,160
Drink.

327
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,720
Desert.

328
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,670
Mon Dieux, I was hungry,
abominably.

329
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,320
Tell me.

330
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,440
Anything.

331
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,920
Why to you hate
this Montfleury?

332
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,860
A very bad actor.

333
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,860
Ah, come now, the real
reason, the truth.

334
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,600
That fat goat who cannot hold
his belly in his arms,

335
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,590
still dreams of being
sweetly dangerous among the women.

336
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:47,610
Sighs and languishes, making sheep's
eyes out of his great frog's face.

337
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,750
I hate him ever since one day
he dared smile upon....

338
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,220
Oh, my friend, I seemed to see over
some flower a great snail crawling.

339
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,180
Eh, what?

340
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,340
Is it possible?

341
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:06,180
For me to love?

342
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,660
I love.

343
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:12,570
Whom?
May I know?

344
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:13,620
Whom I love?

345
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,000
Think a moment.

346
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,280
Think of me.

347
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,670
Me, whom the plainest
woman would despise.

348
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:25,010
Me, with this nose of mine that
marches on before me by a quarter of an hour.

349
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,000
Whom shall I love.

350
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:34,930
Why, of course, it must be the
woman in the world most beautiful.

351
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,170
Most beautiful?

352
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,920
In these eyes of mine....
beyond compare.

353
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,070
Wait.

354
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,440
Your cousin, Roxane.

355
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,300
Yes.

356
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,080
Roxane.

357
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,810
Well?

358
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,020
Why not?
If you love her, tell her so.

359
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,170
My old friend.

360
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,550
Look at me and tell me how
much hope remains for me

361
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,970
with this protuberance.

362
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,360
Ahhh, I have no more illusions.

363
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:12,140
Now and then I may grow tender
walking alone in the blue of evening

364
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:16,130
through some garden fresh with flowers
after the benediction of the rain.

365
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,930
My poor big devil of a nose
inhales April.

366
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:26,950
And I follow with my eyes where
some boy with a girl upon his arm,

367
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:32,130
passes a patch of silver...
and I feel somehow....

368
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,490
I wish I had a woman, too,

369
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:41,660
walking with me under the moon,
and holding my arm and smiling.

370
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,240
Then I dream.

371
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,140
I forget.

372
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:53,210
And then I see the shadow
of my profile on the wall.

373
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,050
My friend.

374
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,230
My friend.

375
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,370
I have my bitter days,
knowing myself so ugly, so alone.

376
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,260
Ah, but your wit, your courage,

377
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,170
why that poor child who just
now offered you your dinner,

378
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,710
your saw it, her eyes
did not avoid you.

379
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,920
That is true.

380
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,930
Well, then, Roxane herself,
watching your duel, pale.

381
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:19,480
Pale?

382
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,670
Yes, her lips parted.
Her hand at her breast, thus.

383
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,020
I saw it.

384
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,260
Speak to her. Speak, man.

385
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,550
She might laugh at me.

386
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,480
It is the one thing
in this world I fear.

387
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:46,490
Pardon, Monsieur,
a lady outside asking for you.

388
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,750
Monsieur.

389
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,270
A Duenna.

390
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,530
I have a message for you
from a...a certain lady.

391
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,760
She desires to know when
and where she may see you privately.

392
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:00,070
She has certain
things to tell you.

393
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,850
Certain...

394
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,010
Things!

395
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,720
She wishes to see me?

396
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,410
We go tomorrow at dawn
to hear mass at St. Rupe

397
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,070
And afterwards, where
would you suggest?

398
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,630
Well, then, I...

399
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,300
- Where?
- Well?

400
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,070
Ah....I am thinking.

401
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,080
And you think?

402
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:20,590
Where?

403
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,060
The shop at Ragueneau's.

404
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,580
Yes, yes, Ragueneau,
the pastry cook.

405
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,400
Who dwells?

406
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:27,590
Rue Saint Honore.

407
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:28,690
Eh...Rue Saint Honore.

408
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:33,530
We are agreed. At 7 o'clock.
Until then. Adieu.

409
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:39,940
I'll be there.

410
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,110
Me! To see me!

411
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,830
Ah, not quite so gloomy.

412
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,580
After all, she knows
that I exist.

413
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,060
Imagine, she has
asked to see me!

414
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,240
So, now you're
going to be happy?

415
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,350
Happy.
I'm going to be a storm.
A flame!

416
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,430
I need to fight whole
armies all alone!

417
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,840
I have ten hearts!

418
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,280
I have a hundred arms!.

419
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:04,450
I feel too strong
to war with mortals!

420
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,150
BRING ME GIANTS!

421
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,240
Quiet, please, shhh.
We are rehearsing back here.

422
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,600
So sorry.
Ha, ha, ha.

423
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:22,280
Cyrano.

424
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:23,630
Cyrano.

425
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,590
Ragueneau.

426
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,910
Oh, thank goodness
you're still here.

427
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,180
Well, what's the matter.

428
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,410
I'm afraid to go home.

429
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,040
Why?

430
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,050
You know those
comic verses I wrote?

431
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:34,830
About the congregation.

432
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,260
Cyrano, he's hired ruffians.
Bullies.

433
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,740
A hundred, waiting for
me on the way home.

434
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,620
They're gonna beat me.
Cane me!

435
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:44,450
Please, would you permit me
to spend the night with you?

436
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,420
A hundred men,
is that all?

437
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,610
Ragueneau, you're
going home tonight.

438
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,630
But they're armed.
They're cutthroats!

439
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,620
Take this lantern.
Forward march.

440
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,760
I say that I'll be the man
to see you to your shop.

441
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,150
Not you, I want no help from you.

442
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:58,510
For even for a hundred,
you're mad.

443
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,730
Those are the odds I want.

444
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,420
Why for this pastry cook?

445
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,820
First, because this
pastry cook is a friend of mine.

446
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,820
Second, because this
pastry cook is also a poet.

447
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,360
And, most important,

448
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,000
if anything should
happen to this pastry cook,

449
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:16,870
tomorrow morning at seven
his shop will be closed.

450
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,590
Goodnight.

451
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,060
(a whistle signal)

452
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,480
Cyrano. Help!

453
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,580
Look out behind you!

454
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,810
I have been robbed.

455
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,070
- There are no hundred here.

456
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,360
It's, it's, it's...

457
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,230
Be quick. Inside.

458
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,550
Bolt the door!

459
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,310
Ah!

460
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,660
Yah!

461
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,210
(ruffians shouting)

462
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,010
Ah!

463
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,560
Awk.

464
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:08,030
(ruffians shouting)

465
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,280
(Le Bret)
- Cyrano!

466
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,320
- Hold!

467
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,330
Ah.

468
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,420
How do you feel?

469
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,540
Oh, pleasantly exhilarated.

470
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,990
- Come, I know a little tavern not far...
- Where's Ragueneau?

471
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:46,320
Ragueneau?
Ragueneau!

472
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:49,510
Little boy, come out.
All's well!

473
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,990
- Is it over?
- All over.

474
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,020
Really?

475
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,340
So soon?

476
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:56,140
Ha, ha, ha.

477
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:59,480
Oh, if only I'd  had my sword.
How many did we kill?

478
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,330
Oh, about eight.

479
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:00,960
Eight.

480
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,410
Eight!

481
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,420
Ohhhh.

482
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,910
This.....gentleman
begins to annoy me.

483
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,630
(Ragueneau is a poet, too.)

484
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:40,010
No. The sauce and meat must rhyme.
Add a pinch of marigold and thyme.

485
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,960
Your house, of course, needs a stronger roof.
Eh? There's proof.

486
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,830
Cyrano.

487
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,500
Cyrano.

488
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,100
Come in and eat.

489
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,110
- What time is it?
- Not quite seven.

490
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:54,140
Oh, now, please, Cyrano.
A man without breakfast is like...

491
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,720
No.
Could she have changed her mind?

492
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,920
Aw, she wouldn't dare.

493
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,900
We were magnificent last night.

494
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,830
And at the theater, too.

495
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,320
'Then, as I end the refrain'....

496
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:07,390
When she arrives.
Where can we converse undisturbed?

497
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,190
Wherever you like.
My shop is yours.

498
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,900
The little dining room
is quite romantic.

499
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,490
'Thrust home!'
Yea gods, what a line.

500
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,650
- 'Then as I end the re....'
- Vanish.

501
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,110
- Uh, huh, she's come?
- Shhhh.

502
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:18,920
I swear.

503
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,170
Welcome.

504
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,510
- A pardon, one word.
- Oh, yes?

505
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,520
Have you a good digestion?

506
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,430
Oh, wonderful.

507
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:48,800
Eh, here are some éclairs.
Uh, creampuffs.

508
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,160
Some, uh,  jellyrolls.
And do you like nature?

509
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,400
I adore it.

510
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,760
Go out and eat these in the sunshine.
Do not return.

511
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,440
But why?

512
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,910
Until you have finished them.

513
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,340
(outside)
- What do I do then?

514
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,750
(door closes)

515
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:13,000
Blessed above all others be the hour
when you remember to remember me,

516
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:15,800
and came to tell me......what?

517
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,750
To tell you that....

518
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,810
Before I dare tell you I....

519
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,850
Are you, I wonder, still
the same big brother almost

520
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,720
that you used to be
when we were children,

521
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,570
playing by the pond
in the old garden down there?

522
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,570
At Bergerac.
Those lovely summers.

523
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,700
You use to make swords
out of bulrushes.

524
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,810
And you, dandelions
also golden hair.

525
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,930
In those days
I could tell you everything.

526
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,860
And you did
everything I wished.

527
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:44,830
Little Roxane, a sweet tyrone
with short skirts and long hair.

528
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,780
Was I pretty?

529
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,270
Not too plain.

530
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:54,490
Sometimes when you had fallen
or hurt your hand,

531
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,670
you used to come running to me,
and I would be your mother and say,

532
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:02,770
oh, with a very grownup voice,
'Now, what have you been doing to yourself?'

533
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,300
'Let me see.'

534
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,060
- Oh!
- No one that.

535
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,230
Wait, let me see.

536
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,540
Still. At your age?

537
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:13,810
Now, how did you do that?

538
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,910
Playing with the big boys
at the Place de Neanne.

539
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,410
Come here.

540
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,020
Such a wise little mother.

541
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:24,740
And tell me, while I wash this
blood away, how many you played with?

542
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,840
- Oh, about a hundred.
- A hundred?

543
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,950
- More or less.
- It can't be.

544
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,080
No.

545
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,720
Tell me what you were
going to tell me.....

546
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,320
if you dared.

547
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:38,060
I think I do dare, now.

548
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,450
It seems so like
those happy days long ago.

549
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,780
Yes, I dare.

550
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:47,190
Listen....I love someone.

551
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:48,440
Yes?

552
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,150
Someone who does not know.

553
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,340
Yes?

554
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:54,970
Someone who loves me, too,
but is afraid of me and keeps away

555
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,340
and never says one word.

556
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:58,270
(softly)
Yes.

557
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,210
Give my that hand.

558
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,080
Why, how hot it is.

559
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:06,390
Yes, he loves me.
I am sure of it.

560
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,530
(softly)
Yes.

561
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,730
And he is a soldier, too,
in your own regiment,

562
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,710
your own company.

563
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,750
(loud)
Yes.

564
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,480
Such a man.

565
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,280
He is proud, noble, young, brave,

566
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,700
beautiful!

567
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,550
(softly)
Beautiful.

568
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,040
What's the matter?

569
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,160
Oh, nothing.

570
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,210
It's this, my hand.

571
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,280
I love him.
That is all.

572
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:38,230
And I have never seen him
anywhere except in the theater.

573
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,710
You have never spoken?

574
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,790
Only with our hearts.

575
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,080
Well, then, how do you know?

576
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,270
Well, people talk about people,
and I hear things, and...

577
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:52,700
and I know.

578
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,540
(firmly)
You say he is in the guards?

579
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,530
His name?

580
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,270
Baron Christian de Neuvillette.

581
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,910
You know him?

582
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:05,650
He is not in the guards.

583
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,020
Yes, since last week.

584
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:09,550
He is only lately
come to Paris...

585
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:11,140
from Normandy.

586
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,070
So soon.
So soon we lose our hearts.

587
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:16,160
What...
(door opens)

588
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,220
(Duenna)
- Monsieur de Bergerac

589
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:18,850
- I have eaten all the cakes.

590
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,280
Good.
Now, go out and enjoy nature.

591
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,110
But my dear child, you love
only words, wit, poetry.

592
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:29,950
Why, for all you know,
the man may be a savage or a fool.

593
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:34,290
Not with such eyes.
I read his soul in them.

594
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:38,360
Yes, all our souls are
written in our eyes.

595
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,720
And you have brought
me here to tell me this?

596
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,890
I do not yet quite understand,
madam, the reason for your confidence.

597
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:52,640
They say, that in your company,
it frightens me, you are all Gascon.

598
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,850
We pick a quarrel with any outsider
who intrudes himself.

599
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,250
Is that what you have heard?

600
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,150
- I'm so afraid for him.
- Not without reason.

601
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:03,730
And I thought you...
it's you whom they all respect and fear.

602
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,590
You want me to defend
your little Baron?

603
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,740
Will you?

604
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,670
Just for me.

605
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,440
Because I have always
been your friend.

606
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,790
And this is what
you want of me?

607
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,430
Will you be his friend?

608
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,200
I will be his friend.

609
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,040
And never let him
fight a duel.

610
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,060
No, never.

611
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:24,750
Promise?

612
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,980
I promise.

613
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,860
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
I knew I could rely on you.

614
00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:35,410
Well, now I must go.

615
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,480
Oh, you never told
me about last night.

616
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,790
Why, you must
have been a hero.

617
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:50,240
Have write and tell me all about it,
and...about himself.

618
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,330
Oh, you are a darling.
We are great friends, are we not?

619
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,330
He must write to me.

620
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,490
A hundred men against one.
You shall tell me the whole story

621
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,980
someday when we have time.

622
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:10,170
A hundred men.
What courage!

623
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,810
I have done better.

624
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,450
Well?

625
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,050
Let us leave this place.

626
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,620
But the whole company
is on its way here.

627
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,330
Oh, no.

628
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:30,870
On my heels. Naturally I told
them all about last night.

629
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:31,880
They're wild.

630
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,830
Here they are.

631
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,420
- Yes, but, why did you?
- Perhaps I can stop them.

632
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:36,870
Never mind.

633
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,220
Cyrano!

634
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:46,070
(greetings and cheers to Cyrano)

635
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:51,570
Eight dead men in the street.
Scandalous.

636
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,010
You know my edict
against dueling, nephew.

637
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:55,580
I expect to have it enforced.

638
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:58,940
Furthermore, I wish to know
who was responsible for last night's

639
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,410
outrage at the Place de Neanne.

640
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,840
I understand, Your Eminence.

641
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,180
Very well.
And now I have news

642
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:06,310
that should be more
to you liking.

643
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,410
I fear, in confidence, our
uneasy armistice with Spain is doomed.

644
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:14,410
My colonelcy?

645
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,670
You commission has been prepared.

646
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,890
Oh, thank you, uncle, thank you.

647
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,630
Oh, one thing more.

648
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,600
Last night at the theater,
the duel in rhyme,

649
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,970
that guardsman with a nose.

650
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:30,240
- Bergerac, that impossible Gascon.
- Yes, impossible.

651
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,300
- His treatment of Montfleury.
- Abominable.

652
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:35,230
- The arrogance with which he closed the play.
- Incredible.

653
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,130
- It will be a miracle if the Vicomte survives.
- A sorrow.

654
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,720
What will you do
with him, Your Eminence?

655
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,100
I? Nothing.

656
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,290
I thought I might
leave that to you.

657
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,500
To me?

658
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:48,270
Yes. Place him somewhere
in your service,

659
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,890
with a comfortable allowance.

660
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:51,390
He looked a little threadbare.

661
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:55,020
I...You...But, Your Eminence.
You detest dueling.

662
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:55,960
Of course I do.

663
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,070
Why didn't you prevent it?

664
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:01,350
I should much prefer
that monsieur de Beregrac

665
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,300
live by the pen,
rather than die by the sword.

666
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,470
Do you not agree, Antoine?

667
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:12,560
By all means, Your Eminence.
By all means.

668
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:21,650
'And then, as I end the refrain...
thrust home.'

669
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:28,740
(Carousing at Ragueneau's)

670
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:39,860
(noisy celebration of Cyrano's
defeat of 'a hundred' ruffians)

671
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:46,580
(Antoine Comte de Guiche enters)

672
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,620
Monsieur de Bergerac.

673
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,390
Your Excellency.

674
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,750
I have come to express my....

675
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,550
admiration for both
your exploits last night.

676
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:01,290
Indeed. Thank you.

677
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,900
My dear fellow,
we may have had our differences,

678
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:07,550
but I am disposed
to forget them.

679
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,710
That is very generous
of you, sir.

680
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,560
No, truly.

681
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,970
You are, it seems, a man
of many skills.

682
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:17,350
A rare combination
soldier and poet.

683
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:21,750
- Would you care to join my following?
- No, sir.

684
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:23,260
I do not follow.

685
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,980
I am told you have
written a play.

686
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,510
As you know, my uncle,
the Cardinal, is also a dramatist.

687
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,990
I might help you there.

688
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:34,050
Cyrano, now at last
you can have it performed.

689
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,200
Why not?

690
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,620
I could take it to him.

691
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,330
Really?

692
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,460
Of course.
Let him rewrite a few lines

693
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,770
here and there, and
he'll find a theater for you.

694
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,230
Rewrite...my lines?

695
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,150
Impossible.

696
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:52,040
Uh, when he likes a thing,
he pays well.

697
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,240
Yes, but not so well as I.

698
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:55,460
When I have made a line
that sings itself

699
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,220
I pay myself a hundred times.

700
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,940
You are proud, my friend.

701
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,020
You have observed that?

702
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,460
- Cyrano.
See what we found in the street.

703
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,140
Plumes dropped in their flight
by those fine birds

704
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,860
who showed their
tail feathers!

705
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:08,590
(laughter)

706
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,180
The man who hired
those scoundrels,

707
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:12,010
he must be an
angry man today.

708
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,430
Who was it?
Do you know?

709
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:14,790
It was I.

710
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:19,870
I hired them to do the sort
of work we do not soil our hands with.

711
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,940
Punishing an insolent poet.

712
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,610
They ought to be mounted
before they spoil.

713
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:27,850
(laughter)
What shall we do with them?

714
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:36,460
Sir, will you not return these
to your friends?

715
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:42,190
Have you read Don Quixote?

716
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:44,650
I have and found
myself the hero.

717
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:47,770
Be so good as to read once more
the capture of the windmills.

718
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,010
Chapter 13.

719
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,200
Windmills, remember,
if you fight with them...

720
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:56,590
may swing round their huge arms
and cast you down into the mire.

721
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:59,010
Or up among the stars.

722
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:01,970
Gentlemen.

723
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,320
Gentlemen.

724
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,550
Gentlemen.

725
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,610
You've done it, now.

726
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:07,860
You've made your fortune.

727
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:09,070
He was willing to forget.

728
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:11,180
There you go again, growling.

729
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:13,460
Yesss,
this latest pose of yours,

730
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,070
ruining every opportunity
that comes you way,

731
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,100
becomes exaggerated.

732
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,250
Very well, then, I exaggerate.

733
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,710
There are certain things
in this world

734
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,100
a man does well
to carry to extremes.

735
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,710
Your precious independence.
Your white plume.

736
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,410
How do you expect
to succeed in life?

737
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,400
What would you have me do?

738
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,590
Seek for the patronage
of some great man

739
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:31,880
and like a creeping vine
on a tall tree crawl upward

740
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:33,520
where I cannot stand alone?

741
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,850
No, thank you.

742
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:39,880
Be a buffoon in the vile hope
of teasing out a smile on some cold face.

743
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,710
No, thank you.

744
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:44,260
Eat a toad for breakfast
every morning.

745
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,530
Make my knees calloused.
Cultivate a supple spine.

746
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,320
Wear out my belly
groveling in the dust.

747
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,400
No, thank you.

748
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:54,880
With my left hand scratch the back
of any swine that roots up gold for me

749
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:58,910
while my right, too proud to know
his partner's business, takes in the fee.

750
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,920
No, thank you.

751
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,810
Shall I use the fire God gave me
to burn incense all day long?

752
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,020
No, thank you.

753
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,410
Struggle to insinuate my name
into the columns of the Gazette?

754
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:13,250
Calculate, scheme, be afraid?
Love more to make a  visit than a poem?

755
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:15,990
Seek introductions, favors,
influences?

756
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,050
No, thank you.

757
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,270
No, I thank you, and
again I thank you.

758
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:30,320
But, to sing, to laugh, to dream,
to walk in my own way,

759
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,510
free with and eye
to see things as they are.

760
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,240
A voice that means manhood.

761
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,640
To cut my have
the right shoes.

762
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:46,150
And a word, a yes, a no,
to fight, or write,

763
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,440
but never to make
a line I have not heard

764
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:49,780
in my own heart.

765
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,380
To travel any
road under the sun,

766
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,780
under the stars,

767
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,520
nor care if fame or fortune
lie beyond the bourne.

768
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,250
Yet, with all modesty to say,

769
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:05,830
my soul be satisfied
with flowers,

770
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,000
with weeds,

771
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:10,840
with thorns, even,

772
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:14,940
but gather them in the one garden
you may call your own.

773
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,450
In a word, I'm too proud
to be a parasite.

774
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:21,470
And if mine intellect the germ
that grows towering to heaven

775
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,770
like the mountain pine

776
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,570
I stand not high, it may be,

777
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:28,460
but alone.

778
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,170
Alone, yes, but why
go about making enemies?

779
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:35,850
Watching other people
making friends...everywhere,

780
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:37,980
as a dog makes friends.

781
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,550
I mark the manner of
these canine courtesies,

782
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:46,770
and think, here comes,
thank heaven, another enemy.

783
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:52,760
Yes, tell this to all the world,
and then to me say very softly

784
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,540
that she loves you not.

785
00:43:58,830 --> 00:44:00,940
Let me be alone
for a moment.

786
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:05,050
Cyrano, wait.

787
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,760
Give us your story
of the fight.

788
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:08,400
Presently.

789
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:10,010
No, the story, now!

790
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,970
Oh, let him alone.
There's time enough.

791
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,360
I want it now!

792
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:19,090
As an example for that young
tadpole sneaking out the doorway.

793
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,040
You, there.

794
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:26,820
Are you addressing me?

795
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:32,770
Yes, you flat-footed
Norman farmer.

796
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:37,470
You wish something of me?

797
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,950
Listen, Monsieur de...de...de
whatever your name is.

798
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:40,920
de Neuvillette!

799
00:44:41,090 --> 00:44:43,230
Baron Christan de Neuvillette.

800
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:45,370
Very well, de Neuvillette.

801
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:48,080
As you are a newcomer here,
you should know there is a

802
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:52,300
certain subject or object, if you prefer,
that is never mentioned among us.

803
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,340
And that is....?

804
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:54,500
Look at me!

805
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,980
(touching his nose)

806
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,360
You understand?

807
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,670
You mean....?

808
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,090
Thus we never speak that word.

809
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,390
To even breathe it is
to have to do with him.

810
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:08,760
He has exterminated several
whose mere tone of voice suggested...

811
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:12,920
Would you die before your time?
Just mention anything convex.

812
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,530
Or cartilaginous.

813
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:18,540
One word. One syllable.
One gesture. Nay, one sneeze.

814
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:21,330
And your handkerchief
becomes your winding sheet.

815
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:24,920
Captain.

816
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:26,290
Sir?

817
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:30,090
What is the proper thing to do
when Gascons grow too boastful?

818
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,820
Prove to them that one may
be a Norman and still have courage.

819
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:35,100
I thank you.

820
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:43,360
Come on, Cyrano, your story.

821
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:47,330
(shouts of encouragement)

822
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,540
Now, let me see.
Where shall we begin?

823
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:52,510
I followed with our host
to meet those scoundrels

824
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:53,640
not knowing where
they might attack.

825
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,340
No lamps in those narrow
back streets.

826
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,600
No moon in the sky.

827
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,220
Dark. Everything dark.

828
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:04,040
It was so dark, Mon Dieux,
you could not see beyond...

829
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,470
Your nose!

830
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:08,480
(Christian shows his courage.)

831
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:33,250
Who...is that...man...there?

832
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,380
- A new recruit.

833
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:37,550
- Arrived last week.

834
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,080
A recruit, eh?

835
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:41,940
Ha, ha---.

836
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:45,320
His name is Christian de Neuvillette.

837
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:48,660
(Cyrano remembers his
promise to Roxane.)

838
00:46:58,510 --> 00:46:59,570
I see.

839
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:03,510
Very well.

840
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:06,470
As I was saying.

841
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:11,930
It grew dark.

842
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:15,180
You could not see
your hand before your eyes.

843
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:19,470
I marched on thinking our all for
the sake of one amateur poet

844
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:22,660
- who wrote a verse whenever he took a..
-  A nose full.

845
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:25,770
...whenever he took a notion.,

846
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,600
and might antagonize
some dangerous man.

847
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:30,830
One powerful enough
to make me pay...

848
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:31,980
Through the nose!

849
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:33,090
...pay the piper!

850
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:35,430
After all, I thought,
why am I putting in my..

851
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:36,310
- Nose!

852
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,170
...putting in my oar in a quarrel
that was none of mine,

853
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,240
however now that I am here,
I may as well go through with it.

854
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:42,840
Come Gascon, do your duty.

855
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,850
Suddenly a sword
flashed in the dark!

856
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,810
I caught it fair...

857
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,810
On the nose!

858
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,130
...on my blade!

859
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,530
Before I knew it,
there I was...

860
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,690
Rubbing noses!

861
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:53,840
...crossing swords with
harvard's joy once.

862
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:54,940
I had the bottom then...

863
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:55,900
A nosegay!

864
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,160
...a monstrous crab tree.

865
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:00,170
(breathing heavily)
He went down for as a wave.

866
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:00,990
I charged...

867
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:02,590
Who was in the air hard.

868
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,450
...at the two of them.

869
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:05,900
Another lunged,
and I parried...

870
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,220
Through your nose!

871
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,310
Right out of here!
All of you go!

872
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,120
Leave me with him.

873
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,660
To my arms, sir.
You have courage.

874
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:29,880
- That pleases me.
- Why?

875
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,820
Come, do you not know
I am her brother?

876
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:32,460
Whose?

877
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,250
Hers. Roxane.

878
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,390
Brother?

879
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:40,170
You?

880
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,150
Well, a distant cousin.
Much the same.

881
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:44,450
- Then she has told you?
- Everything.

882
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,680
- She loves me?
- Perhaps.

883
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:49,950
My dear sir, more than I can say.
I am honored.

884
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:52,040
- Rather sudden.
- Oh, please, forgive me.

885
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:54,270
If you knew how
much I have admired you.

886
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:57,620
- Yes, yes, and all those noses.
- Please. I apologize.

887
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:00,680
Roxane expects a letter.

888
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,300
- From me?
- Yes, why not?

889
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,180
Oh,, No.

890
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:05,880
- Once I write, that ruins everything.
- Why?

891
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,020
Because, any schoolboy can write
to her more gracefully than I.

892
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:10,730
A fool!

893
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:14,560
- You did not attack me like a fool.
- Anyone can pick a quarrel.

894
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,580
No, I'm never at loss
for words among men,

895
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:21,260
but with any women...
paralyzed...speechless, dumb.

896
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,600
I'm one of those
stammering idiots

897
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:25,270
who can not court a woman.

898
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,170
Really?

899
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:28,700
As for myself,
it seems to me that

900
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:32,300
given the opportunity,
and if I put my mind to it,

901
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,390
I could do that..
rather well.

902
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:37,870
Oh, is I had words to say
what I have here!

903
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,450
If I were handsome
like you.

904
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:43,780
Together, we could make
one mighty hero of romance.

905
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,330
If only I had your wit.

906
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:51,710
Borrow it, then.

907
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,150
What?

908
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:55,490
Tell me,

909
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:59,770
would you dare repeat to her
the words I gave you day by day?

910
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,420
Send to her
the letters that I write?

911
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:04,800
I mean, that Roxane
should have no disillusionment.

912
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:06,820
Come, shall we win her
both together?

913
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:07,800
For you?

914
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,970
- Why, Cyrano...
- Christian, why not?

915
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,850
I...I'm afraid.

916
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,030
Afraid that when you
have her all alone, you will lose her.

917
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,420
Have not fear,
it is your self she loves.

918
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:17,920
Give her yourself.

919
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:23,670
Put into words,
my words...upon your lips.

920
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,180
Will you?

921
00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:28,030
Will you?

922
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:30,740
Does it mean
so much to you?

923
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:32,360
It means....

924
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:37,060
It means a comedy,
a situation for a poet.

925
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:38,350
Come, shall we collaborate?

926
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:42,420
I'll be your cloak of darkness,
your enchanted sword,

927
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:45,330
your ring to charm
the fairy princess.

928
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,180
Think!
Is the prize not worth the danger?

929
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:52,980
My friend!

930
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,740
My friend.

931
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:00,100
Take my heart.
I shall have it all the more.

932
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:03,650
Plucking the flowers,
we will keep the plant in bloom.

933
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,010
Thus do I love thee,
my darling.

934
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:09,670
Idiot.

935
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:12,200
There are a dozen
ways to read that line.

936
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,500
Can't you give it some meaning?
Any meaning!

937
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:15,950
THUS do I love thee!

938
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,280
Thus do "I" love thee.

939
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,550
Thus do I LOVE thee.

940
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,930
Thus do I love THEE,
THEE, THEE.

941
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,680
Who knows your smile
has known a perfect thing.

942
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:28,400
You are a white rose,
wherein love lies in ambush

943
00:51:28,430 --> 00:51:30,180
for its natural prey.

944
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:33,760
In the garden of my heart,
you are the most...

945
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:35,680
eh, the most....

946
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:39,750
fragrant blossom.

947
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:44,780
As the tender sapling
thirsts for rain,

948
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,900
as the eagle seeks the sky,

949
00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:51,050
as the wave
hurtles toward the shore,

950
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,990
my heart yearns for you.

951
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:55,820
Good, good.

952
00:51:55,970 --> 00:51:58,740
You know, you're beginning
to have a feel for words.

953
00:51:58,770 --> 00:52:02,010
- Words. I'm sick of words.
- Those are your weapons.

954
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:03,190
How else do you conquer?

955
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,130
Yes, but when, when?

956
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,190
They're fighting in the north, now.
You know that.

957
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:07,690
The Regiment will be
called up any day,

958
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:08,840
and I've never
even kissed her.

959
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,940
Patience, my boy, patience.

960
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,110
I've been patient.

961
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:16,280
Why, she sees the Compte de Guiche
as often as she does me.

962
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,120
Do you suppose
she's playing with me?

963
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,500
Making a fool of me?

964
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:24,880
Impossible.

965
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,210
How can you say?
How do you know?

966
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:31,390
Cyrano, you have her confidence.
You could find out.

967
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,690
Nonsense, I say.

968
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,440
Oh, very well.

969
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:45,190
I'll scout the terrain.

970
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:47,200
Listen, Cyrano,
intelligently, discreetly.

971
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,160
Yes.

972
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:49,340
With finesse.

973
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:55,510
And, uh, what do you think
of Christian after all these weeks?

974
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:58,030
He is beautiful,
but he's brilliant.

975
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:59,760
- And I love him.
- Good!

976
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:01,750
Uh, do you find him intellectual?

977
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:03,600
- More so than you, even.
- Huh?

978
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:06,470
- Oh, I didn't mean.
- No, no, no, I am glad.

979
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:09,290
No man ever so beautifully
said those things.

980
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:11,900
Those pretty nothings
to everything.

981
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:15,780
Sometimes, he,. he, he falls
into a reverie.

982
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,110
His inspiration..fails.

983
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:23,940
But, then all at once,
he will say something absolutely...

984
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:25,370
Ah!

985
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,760
Really?

986
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:28,910
How like a man!

987
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:32,220
You think because a man
has a handsome face he must be a fool.

988
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:34,790
Not necessarily.

989
00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:38,410
Uh, he talks well about, uh,
matters of the heart?

990
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:42,420
He does not talk.
He rhapsodizes. He dreams.

991
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:46,360
Only the other night he said to me,
extemporaneously, mind you.

992
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,220
Oh, of course.

993
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:50,660
'Take my heart.
I shall have it all the more.

994
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,760
'Plucking the flowers
we will keep the plants in bloom.'

995
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:56,730
Well?

996
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:58,530
Umm, passable.

997
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:00,010
He writes well?

998
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:02,080
Wonderfully, listen:

999
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,510
'Knowing you have in store
more heart to give

1000
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:08,160
- 'than I to find heart room...'
- The first he has too much heart,

1001
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:10,400
then too little. Just how much heart
does he need?

1002
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:11,740
You are teasing.

1003
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:12,870
You are jealous!

1004
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:13,690
Jealous?

1005
00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:14,440
Yes.

1006
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:15,840
Poets are all alike.

1007
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,660
Would you dare
criticize these lines?

1008
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,100
'Only believe that unto you
my whole heart gives one cry.

1009
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:29,470
'And writing, writes down
more than you receive.

1010
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,010
'Sending you kisses
through my fingertips.

1011
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:38,020
'Lady, oh, read my letter
with your lips.'

1012
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:43,820
Yes, those last lines,
but he overwrites.

1013
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:44,970
Listen to this.

1014
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:46,000
Do you know
them all by heart?

1015
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,070
Every one.

1016
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:48,500
Well, I may call
that flattering.

1017
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:49,310
He is a master.

1018
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:51,850
- Oh, come..
- Yes, a master.

1019
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:55,270
Huh, a master,...
if you will.

1020
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,520
And, uh, when do you
bestow the laurel wreath?

1021
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:05,290
How many prodigies of poetry
must this new Hercules perform?

1022
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:06,490
I do not know.

1023
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:11,580
My friend, you men own the world
and all that's in it.

1024
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:17,990
Woman is at best a prize, a property
valued much the same as a horse or a dog,

1025
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:22,010
unlike the pear and sheen of skin
and soundness of teeth and limb.

1026
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:27,870
Well, if I must be chattel,
then the terms shall be mine,

1027
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:31,480
and the price according
to my own values.

1028
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:32,670
There.

1029
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:35,460
I see.

1030
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,880
Christian tells me
that you meet tonight.

1031
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:45,210
What would you have him
speak about?

1032
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:47,910
Oh, nothing,

1033
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,530
and everything.

1034
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:54,140
I shall say, speak to me
of love in your own words.

1035
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:56,810
Improvise, rhapsodize.

1036
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:58,790
Be eloquent.

1037
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:01,540
But you will not tell him,
will you?

1038
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:03,270
Ah, perish the thought.

1039
00:56:03,590 --> 00:56:06,370
Madame, Compte de Guiche.

1040
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,820
(Sigh)
Madame.

1041
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:16,880
Monsieur.

1042
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:18,770
Madame.

1043
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:24,270
Monsieur.
(Crunch)

1044
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:35,090
- Christian, quick.
- No.

1045
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,030
There's still time to learn your lines.
No.

1046
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:39,760
I have some brilliant phrases for you,
brilliant, sensitive...

1047
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:40,500
No.

1048
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:42,160
I'll have not more of it.

1049
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,250
Taking all my words, my sentences
all from you,

1050
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:46,490
- making our love a little comedy.
- Don't you real...

1051
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,480
It was a game at first,
but now she cares.

1052
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:49,390
Huh?

1053
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:50,750
Thanks to you.
Uh.

1054
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:53,060
I'm not afraid any longer.
I'll speak for myself, now.

1055
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:53,720
Oh, undoubtedly.

1056
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,990
I will. You shall see!

1057
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,110
Besides, I know enough
to take a woman in my arms,

1058
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:00,870
and tonight, I will.

1059
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:05,420
(knocking on door)
- Christian!

1060
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:07,210
Thank you, my friend,
and goodbye.

1061
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,040
- Christian, I beg of you.
- Leave me!

1062
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:10,830
- You're making a grave error.
- Go away!

1063
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:14,540
So be it.

1064
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:18,600
(door opens)

1065
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,440
Christian.

1066
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:22,580
Roxane.

1067
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:25,330
I'm so glad you are early.

1068
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:28,400
Let us stay out here
in the moonlight.

1069
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:30,490
It's so pleasant.

1070
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:33,630
Sit down.

1071
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:37,720
There, so.

1072
00:57:40,770 --> 00:57:43,780
Now, speak to me.

1073
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:45,470
I love you.

1074
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,330
Yes, speak to me of love.

1075
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:53,390
I...love you.

1076
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:55,640
Now, be eloquent.
Be brilliant for me.

1077
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:57,940
Tonight of all nights.

1078
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:01,560
I love you....so.

1079
00:58:03,610 --> 00:58:07,630
You have your scene.
Now, improvise, rhapsodize.

1080
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:11,570
I love you...
very much!

1081
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,600
I ask for cream,
and you give me milk and water.

1082
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,490
Tell me firstly,
how you love me.

1083
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:23,780
Very much!

1084
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,440
Is that all you feel?

1085
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:29,360
Your throat, if only
I might kiss it.

1086
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:30,170
Christian!

1087
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:31,520
But, Roxane, I love you.

1088
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:32,860
Again.

1089
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:34,450
No, not again.
I do not love you.

1090
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:38,540
That is better.

1091
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:42,870
I...I adore you!

1092
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:43,870
Oh!

1093
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:46,070
I know I grow absurd.

1094
00:58:46,100 --> 00:58:48,870
And that distresses me as much
as if you had grown ugly!

1095
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:54,910
Please. Gather your dreams
together into words.

1096
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:57,830
I...um, I...

1097
00:58:57,870 --> 00:59:00,280
I know. You love me!
Good night!

1098
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:01,440
Oh, but wait, please!

1099
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:02,530
I was going to say...

1100
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:04,510
That you adore me.
Yes, I know that, too.

1101
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:06,720
-No, go away.
- I....

1102
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,290
(door slams shut)

1103
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:28,330
(Cyrano claps his hands)

1104
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,870
A great success.

1105
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:31,720
Help me.

1106
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:33,620
Not I.
Speak for yourself, my friend.

1107
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:35,220
Why I...I can't.

1108
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:38,040
Well, at least you know enough
to take a woman in your arms.

1109
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:39,680
Oh, Cyrano, please!

1110
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:41,610
What, and make your love
a little comedy.

1111
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:44,060
Cyrano, I cannot live
unless I win her back, now.

1112
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:44,610
This moment!

1113
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,890
This moment. How the devil
am I to teach you now, this mo...

1114
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:48,940
(Christian)
Her window.

1115
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:51,690
- Help me, Cyrano, help me.
- Shhhh.

1116
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:54,800
(Cyrano)
It does seem fairly dark.

1117
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:55,780
(Christian)
Well? Well?

1118
00:59:57,490 --> 00:59:59,190
(Cyrano)
It is more than
you deserve.

1119
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:02,010
(Cyrano)
I must try out what
can be done.

1120
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,040
(Cyrano)
Stand over there.

1121
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,500
(Cyrano)
Idiot, here, before the balcony.
I'll whisper you what to say.

1122
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:11,380
- She'll hear..
- Shhhh. Call her.

1123
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,690
(Christian)
Roxane.

1124
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:17,330
(Christian louder)
Roxane.

1125
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,220
(balcony window opens)

1126
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:22,760
Who's calling?

1127
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:24,240
Christian.

1128
01:00:24,570 --> 01:00:25,670
You again.

1129
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,420
I...had to tell you.

1130
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:29,340
No. Go away.
You tell me nothing.

1131
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:30,390
Please.

1132
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:32,240
You do not
love me anymore.

1133
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,810
(Christian copies Cyrano)
No, not anymore.

1134
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:37,340
I love you evermore,

1135
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:40,050
and evermore and more.

1136
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:42,640
Oh, a little better.

1137
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:48,160
Love grows and struggles
like an angry child.

1138
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:50,620
Breaking my heart.

1139
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:53,070
His cradle...

1140
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:54,630
Better still.

1141
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:57,390
But such a babe is dangerous.

1142
01:00:57,910 --> 01:01:00,140
Why not have
smothered it newborn?

1143
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,290
And so I do.

1144
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:05,290
And yet he lives.

1145
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:08,910
I found as you sha...
you shall find

1146
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:14,400
this newborn babe...
and infant Hercules!

1147
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:15,430
Good.

1148
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:16,820
Strong enough at birth

1149
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,600
to strangle
those two serpents

1150
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:20,550
doubt and

1151
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:21,090
<i>What?</i>

1152
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:22,600
pride!

1153
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:24,440
Why, very good.

1154
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:27,880
Only, tell me why
you speak so haltingly.

1155
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:30,580
Has your imagination
gone....lame?

1156
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:35,130
(Cyrano)
This grows too difficult.

1157
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:38,320
Your words tonight
hesitate, why?

1158
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:42,970
Through the warm summer gloom,
they grope in darkness

1159
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:44,690
toward the light of you.

1160
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:47,860
My words are
heavy with honey,

1161
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:49,360
like returning bees.

1162
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:52,310
Yet they must fly so high.

1163
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:54,140
Come nearer then.
Stand you on the bench.

1164
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:55,000
No.

1165
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,190
Then I'll come down.

1166
01:01:56,230 --> 01:01:57,110
NO!

1167
01:01:57,570 --> 01:01:59,380
And why so great a no?

1168
01:02:00,490 --> 01:02:02,920
Let me enjoy the one
moment I ever...

1169
01:02:03,710 --> 01:02:07,110
My one chance
to speak to you...unseen.

1170
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,290
Unseen?

1171
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:09,740
Yes. Yes.

1172
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:12,380
Night making all things
dimly beautiful

1173
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:13,770
one veil over us both.

1174
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:16,040
You need no eyes
to hear my heart.

1175
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:20,410
Oh, tonight, let it seem as if
I speak for the first time.

1176
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:22,110
For the first time?

1177
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:23,000
Yes.

1178
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,780
Your voice, even,
is not the same.

1179
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:26,990
How should it be.

1180
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:28,450
I have another
voice tonight.

1181
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:31,250
My own, myself,... daring!

1182
01:02:31,610 --> 01:02:32,610
Why daring?

1183
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:36,600
Because, what am I, what is any man
would he dare ask for you?

1184
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:40,780
Therefore my heart has hidden behind
poetic words and tinsel phrases.

1185
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:43,640
But are they not sweet,
those pretty phrases?

1186
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:45,630
Not enough sweet
for you and me tonight.

1187
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:49,240
You never spoke
to me like this.

1188
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,510
I tell you, there comes
one moment, once,

1189
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:53,800
and heaven help those
who pass that moment by,

1190
01:02:53,830 --> 01:02:56,110
when beauty stands
looking into the soul

1191
01:02:56,150 --> 01:03:01,810
with grave, sweet eyes,
that sicken at pretty words.

1192
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:06,260
Yes...that is love.

1193
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:07,010
Love.

1194
01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:09,260
A love beyond breath,
beyond reason,

1195
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:11,590
beyond love's own
power of loving.

1196
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:14,200
Your name is like a golden bell
hung in my heart,

1197
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:18,450
and when I think of you I tremble,
and the bell swings and rings,

1198
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:28,580
Roxane! Roxane!
Along my veins...Roxane.

1199
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,970
Yes...that is love.

1200
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,770
(Cyrano)
Yes...that is love.

1201
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:38,920
That wind of terrible
and jealous beauty,

1202
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:44,200
that dark fire,
that soaring, blinding music.

1203
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,690
Yet, you may take my happiness
to make you happier

1204
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:49,410
even though you
never know I gave it to you.

1205
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:55,700
Only let me hear, sometimes, all alone,
the distant laughter of your joy.

1206
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:58,470
Do you begin
to understand a little?

1207
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,200
Can you feel my soul there
in the darkness breathe on you?

1208
01:04:03,230 --> 01:04:06,630
Oh, only tonight,
now I dare say these things.

1209
01:04:06,790 --> 01:04:09,400
I to you, and you hear them.

1210
01:04:10,030 --> 01:04:12,650
It is my voice, mine, my own
that makes you tremble

1211
01:04:12,680 --> 01:04:15,390
there in the green gloom,
above me, for you do tremble

1212
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:18,110
as a blossom among the leaves,
you tremble, and I can feel

1213
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:19,670
all the way down along
this jasmine branch

1214
01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:23,700
whether you will unhold
the passion of you trembling.

1215
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:25,960
Yes, I do tremble.

1216
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,880
And I weep, and I love you,
and I am yours,

1217
01:04:29,910 --> 01:04:31,720
and you have made me thus.

1218
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:38,250
I have done this to you.

1219
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:41,380
I myself.

1220
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:47,240
Only let me ask
one thing more.

1221
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:48,900
I want a kiss!

1222
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,080
You ask me for...

1223
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,060
I...yes.

1224
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:54,260
That is to say...

1225
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:55,770
I mean...

1226
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:57,450
You've gone too far.

1227
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:59,370
If she's willing, why
not make the most of it?

1228
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:04,270
I, I ask.
I know I ask too much.

1229
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:06,420
Only one?

1230
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:08,630
Is that all?

1231
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:12,210
All?
How much more than all?

1232
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:16,030
I know I startle you,
I...I ask, I ask you to refuse.

1233
01:05:16,070 --> 01:05:17,200
Why? Why? Why?

1234
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:18,350
Christian, be quiet.

1235
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:19,430
What is that your say?

1236
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:21,810
I am angry with myself,
because I know I go too far

1237
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:26,270
and so I say to myself,
CHRISTIAN, BE QUIET!

1238
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,300
Watch it, someone comes.

1239
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:39,180
Well, sir, I am looking
for the house of madame Roxane Robin.

1240
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:43,450
This is not the house. That way.
To the right. Keep to the right.

1241
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:44,330
I thank you sir.

1242
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:47,880
I shall say my beads for you
to the very last bead.

1243
01:05:49,340 --> 01:05:50,680
Win me that kiss?

1244
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:52,070
No!

1245
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:53,780
Sooner or later.

1246
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:00,510
So that is true.

1247
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:07,540
Sooner or later must be so, because,
she is young, and you are handsome.

1248
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:15,240
Since it must be, I'd rather be
myself the cause, if it must be.

1249
01:06:16,990 --> 01:06:19,620
(balcony window opens)

1250
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,660
Are you still there?

1251
01:06:24,690 --> 01:06:25,470
(Cyrano)
Yes.

1252
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,740
We were speaking of...

1253
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:32,450
A kiss.
- A kiss.

1254
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,340
And what is a kiss
when all is done?

1255
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:37,080
A vow taken before
the shrine of memory.

1256
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,650
A rosy dot
over the "i" of loving.

1257
01:06:39,790 --> 01:06:42,950
- A secret whisper
to listen if the past.

1258
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:43,650
Shhh.

1259
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:46,720
A moment free to mortal
with a rush of wing from Ceden.

1260
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:48,220
A sacrament of blossoms.

1261
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:53,250
A new song sung by two hearts
to an old, simple tune.

1262
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:54,430
Hush.

1263
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:56,050
Why? What shame?

1264
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:01,310
No.
No shame.

1265
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:02,770
Then come.

1266
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:05,680
Gather your sacred blossoms.

1267
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:09,230
Your moment made immortal.

1268
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:09,860
Climb!

1269
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:12,300
- But, climb?
- Many more!

1270
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:23,760
Roxane.

1271
01:07:33,870 --> 01:07:34,690
(sigh)

1272
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:39,770
Ah, Roxane.
I have won what I have wanted.

1273
01:07:40,320 --> 01:07:45,410
A feast of love,
and I am faint with hunger.

1274
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:51,040
Yet, I have something here
that is mine now,...

1275
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:53,380
and was not mine before.

1276
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:56,790
I spoke the words
that won her.

1277
01:07:57,890 --> 01:08:05,890
She kisses my words.
My words...upon his lips.

1278
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:08,650
(gate opens)

1279
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:14,670
What, dear Father,
lost your way again?

1280
01:08:14,710 --> 01:08:16,270
But, she lives here,
Madame Robin.

1281
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,830
Oh, I thought
you said, Rolen?

1282
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,850
No, r..o..b..i..n, Robin.

1283
01:08:19,890 --> 01:08:21,030
Oh, Robin, I see.

1284
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:23,090
I'm too old
to chase wild geese

1285
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:25,080
- my feet...
- Oh, what a shame,

1286
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,920
(knocking on door)
however, I'm sure there's someone at home.

1287
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:30,120
(door opens)

1288
01:08:30,150 --> 01:08:30,860
What is it?

1289
01:08:30,890 --> 01:08:34,570
Yeah, I'm looking for
the young lady, Madam Rolen

1290
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:35,840
Rolen?

1291
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,080
Robin!

1292
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:40,050
Madame!
A letter for you.

1293
01:08:40,590 --> 01:08:42,070
Yes, yes, I heard.

1294
01:08:42,970 --> 01:08:43,650
Cyrano.

1295
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:46,080
Uh, passing by cousin,
I saw this light.

1296
01:08:46,700 --> 01:08:50,330
Uh, some matter
profitable to the soul.

1297
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:52,550
A very noble lord gave it to me.

1298
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:53,640
(Christian)
What is it?

1299
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,100
<i>My regiment has been
ordered to the front. </i>

1300
01:08:57,130 --> 01:08:59,490
<i>I cannot allow you
to delay any longer.</i>

1301
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:01,820
<i>This simple old monk,
who knows nothing,</i>

1302
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:04,190
<i>will marry us tonight.
My love, Antoine de Guiche.</i>

1303
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:07,110
(Roxane changes everything)

1304
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:08,880
Father, this letter
concerns you.

1305
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:13,930
"Madame, the Cardinal
will have his way,

1306
01:09:13,970 --> 01:09:15,530
"although against your will.

1307
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:18,150
"That is why I am
sending this to you,

1308
01:09:18,180 --> 01:09:20,470
"by a most holy man.

1309
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,160
"Intelligent, discreet.

1310
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:26,660
"You will communicate
to him our order to perform

1311
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:31,160
"here and at once
the rite of holy matrimony.

1312
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:35,910
"You and Christian will be
married privately in your house.

1313
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,760
"Be resigned to the
Cardinal's command,

1314
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,930
"who sends herewith
his blessings.

1315
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,060
"Your very humble,
and etcetera..."

1316
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:46,750
Oh, this is terrible.

1317
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:49,850
Oh, you're to be
the, uh...

1318
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:51,490
I am to be the bridegroom.

1319
01:09:53,950 --> 01:09:56,230
Uh, look here.
A postscript.

1320
01:09:56,780 --> 01:10:02,320
"Give to the monastery,
in my name 120 pieces of gold."

1321
01:10:02,350 --> 01:10:04,070
One hundred and twenty...

1322
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:08,530
Oh, a worthy lord.
A very worthy lord.

1323
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:12,030
Daughter, resign yourself.

1324
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:14,080
I am resigned.

1325
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:24,500
The Guiche is coming, too.
Don't let him enter.

1326
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:25,730
Not let him enter?

1327
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:27,790
Until we're married, please.

1328
01:10:28,610 --> 01:10:30,340
(door slams shut)

1329
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:45,250
(Count)
What is that?

1330
01:10:45,340 --> 01:10:46,330
(Cyrano)
Me?

1331
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:48,360
- Why, where did you come from?
- The moon.

1332
01:10:48,390 --> 01:10:49,330
- You...
- From the moon.

1333
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,690
I have just returned
from the moon.

1334
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,420
- The fellow's mad!
-Like a bomb, I tell you,

1335
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:54,130
- I fell from the moon!
- Your feet must...

1336
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,450
- I say THE MOON!

1337
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,580
- Very well, if you say so.
- Thank you.

1338
01:10:57,610 --> 01:10:58,610
- Raving mad.

1339
01:11:00,660 --> 01:11:02,850
- Where am I?
- My dear sir!

1340
01:11:02,890 --> 01:11:04,080
- What place is this?
What country?

1341
01:11:04,110 --> 01:11:06,170
- Please, let me pass.
- This face, good heavens!

1342
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:08,710
Maul, a robber.
Where am I?

1343
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:12,830
- A lady is waiting for me.
- Oh, this is Paris, huh?

1344
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:13,620
You fool!

1345
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:14,800
Dear old Paris.

1346
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:17,750
Excuse my appearance.
I arrived by the last thunderbolt.

1347
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:19,970
A trifled singed
as I passed through the ether.

1348
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:21,320
Monsieur!

1349
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,080
Sir?

1350
01:11:22,130 --> 01:11:23,750
That will do, now. I wish...

1351
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:25,600
I know, you wish to look for
my own list of nature for moons

1352
01:11:25,630 --> 01:11:27,820
and happiness and character
of it's surface, if any.

1353
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:29,060
I desire no such thing, I...

1354
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:30,060
Of course not.

1355
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:34,330
You wish to know
by what mysterious

1356
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:35,570
means I reached the moon.

1357
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:37,870
Well, a very secret affair of state,

1358
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:41,770
but confidentially
a new invention of my own.

1359
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:43,190
Drunk, two ways.
Well a man..

1360
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:46,050
Oh, no. In truth I have
my choice of several inventions.

1361
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:46,600
Uh?

1362
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:50,850
Yes, several ways
to violate the virgin sky.

1363
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:52,210
Several?

1364
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:53,510
Several.

1365
01:11:53,540 --> 01:11:57,520
As, for instance, smoke
having a natural tendency to rise,

1366
01:11:57,550 --> 01:12:02,050
blow in a globe
enough to raise me.

1367
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:03,300
Yes, that makes one.

1368
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:06,780
Again, I might construct a rocket
in the shape of a HUGE locust

1369
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:10,810
driven by impulses up within
a saltpeter from the rear

1370
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:14,050
and thus speed upwards,
like, thus!

1371
01:12:14,260 --> 01:12:15,260
Yes, another?

1372
01:12:15,290 --> 01:12:18,950
Finally, seated on an iron plate,
hurl a magnet into the air.

1373
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:21,810
The iron follows.
I catch the magnet.

1374
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:25,330
Throw it again, and
so proceed indefinitely.

1375
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:27,460
Excellent, and
which did you adopt?

1376
01:12:31,450 --> 01:12:32,370
Why none of them.

1377
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,350
Yet another.

1378
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:35,740
Which was...?

1379
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:47,500
Guess.

1380
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:49,370
Ahhh, I can't!

1381
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:51,100
Try.

1382
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:53,980
Interesting idiot, this.

1383
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:06,540
Have you guessed it yet?

1384
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:07,960
Why, no, what is it?

1385
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:15,870
Alas, you will never know,
but no matter.

1386
01:13:15,910 --> 01:13:18,470
You are free and
they are bound in wedlock.

1387
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:21,010
I drunk that voice,
and that nose, Cyrano!

1388
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:23,710
Cyrano. This very moment
they have exchanged vows.

1389
01:13:23,750 --> 01:13:24,460
Who?

1390
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:31,530
My sincere compliments.

1391
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,900
You, also, my traveler in space.

1392
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:37,800
My Lord, the heads of Capathieu
and Joyce have joined together.

1393
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:38,750
Quite so!

1394
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:44,160
Madame, kindly bid
your... husband farewell.

1395
01:13:44,190 --> 01:13:46,670
Your regiment leaves tonight, sir.
Report at once!

1396
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:49,320
But, the Cadets are not called.

1397
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:51,850
They are, indeed, and
under my command.

1398
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:55,080
Out there we may
have an accounting.

1399
01:13:55,240 --> 01:13:58,130
Somehow, that news
fails to disquiet me.

1400
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:01,190
Here are the orders.
Baron, deliver this.

1401
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:03,650
Christian!

1402
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,660
The bridal night
is not so near.

1403
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:13,400
Somehow that news
fails to disquiet me.

1404
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:19,340
Baron, you have your orders.

1405
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:37,530
Farewell, Roxane.

1406
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:40,490
Take care of him, for me.
Promise me never to let him

1407
01:14:40,530 --> 01:14:41,400
do anything dangerous.

1408
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:42,890
I will do my best.
I cannot promise.

1409
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:44,970
I thought you brave always.
Make him be careful.

1410
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:46,070
Yes, yes, I'll try.

1411
01:14:46,110 --> 01:14:47,840
Be sure to keep him
warm and dry!

1412
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:49,150
Yes, if possible.

1413
01:14:49,190 --> 01:14:51,820
Have him write to me
every single day!

1414
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:54,090
That, I promise you.

1415
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,970
(the war with Spain)

1416
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:41,540
Halt!

1417
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:03,920
Uh!

1418
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:18,590
(Madame Baroness de Neuvillette,
Rue Marais No. 12, Paris)

1419
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:48,170
The situation
is simple, gentlemen.

1420
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:53,340
We have besieged Arras.
The Prince of Spain has besieged us.

1421
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:55,960
Consequently, we
are surrounded.

1422
01:16:56,050 --> 01:16:58,920
- A fine war. Where
the besiegers are besieged

1423
01:16:58,950 --> 01:17:00,020
and starve to death.

1424
01:17:00,060 --> 01:17:01,990
Yes, but the Marshal has
devised a brilliant plan

1425
01:17:02,030 --> 01:17:03,480
for bringing in food
this very night.

1426
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:04,460
Now, see here.

1427
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:06,240
Spare us the details, Colonel.

1428
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:08,820
Merely inform us
when the food arrives.

1429
01:17:08,860 --> 01:17:11,380
True, we are hungry.
But why blame me?

1430
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,320
I'm only your Colonel.

1431
01:17:14,700 --> 01:17:16,910
Oh, yes, I know
you disprove of me.

1432
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:18,940
Call me courtier, politician.

1433
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:22,080
Well, I can afford you little hates.

1434
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:24,730
My conduct under fire
is well known.

1435
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:27,170
It was only yesterday
I repelled a Spanish attack.

1436
01:17:27,200 --> 01:17:29,070
Pouring my men down
like an avalanche.

1437
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:30,710
I, myself lead the charge.

1438
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:33,330
- And your white scarf?
(through a cannon barrel)

1439
01:17:33,370 --> 01:17:34,130
Cyrano!

1440
01:17:37,880 --> 01:17:39,140
And your white scarf?

1441
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:40,480
Eh, you heard that episode?

1442
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:44,110
Yes, I was so far in advance
I was in danger of being captured.

1443
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:46,570
But I thought quickly,
took off and flung away

1444
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:48,290
the scarf that marked
my military rank.

1445
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:51,150
And so being inconspicuous
escaped among my own force,

1446
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:54,250
rallied them, returned,
and won the day.

1447
01:17:54,290 --> 01:17:55,500
What do you say to that?

1448
01:17:55,540 --> 01:17:58,550
Still, enough that is not likely
to resign the privilege of being a target.

1449
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:01,690
How pleasant for you
that you are denied that privilege.

1450
01:18:01,730 --> 01:18:03,650
Pleasant?
Lend me your scarf.

1451
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:05,570
With your permission I shall
lead the first charge tonight

1452
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:06,890
wearing it over my shoulder.

1453
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:07,720
What bluster.

1454
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:09,630
You're safe making that offer,
and you know it.

1455
01:18:09,670 --> 01:18:12,620
My scarf lies on the
river bank between the lines.

1456
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:15,560
A spot swept by artillery.
Impossible to reach alive.

1457
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:16,700
Yes.

1458
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:20,500
(displays the Colonel's scarf)

1459
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:22,410
Here.

1460
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:24,590
(laughter)

1461
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:26,500
Thank you.

1462
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:31,000
This bit of white is
what I need to make a signal.

1463
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:33,360
I was hesitating.

1464
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:35,720
You have decided me.

1465
01:18:41,370 --> 01:18:43,010
- Stand or I'll fire!
- Hold you fire.

1466
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:44,650
There's a man down
there running away.

1467
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:46,700
Yes, a Spaniard.

1468
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:50,310
But very useful as a spy
to both sides.

1469
01:18:51,270 --> 01:18:52,480
As I was about
to tell you.

1470
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:55,100
The Marshal has withdrawn
more than half our forces here.

1471
01:18:55,140 --> 01:18:57,190
Fortunately, the Spaniards
do not know that.

1472
01:18:57,230 --> 01:19:00,470
Oh, yes, they do now,
and they will attack tonight.

1473
01:19:00,510 --> 01:19:02,240
At this point.

1474
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,520
Your revenge, eh?

1475
01:19:04,550 --> 01:19:06,670
I make not great
pretense in loving you.

1476
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:10,170
But since you gentlemen
esteem yourselves invincible,

1477
01:19:10,200 --> 01:19:12,710
the bravest of the brave,
and all that.

1478
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:14,120
Why need we be personal.

1479
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:16,710
The Marshal needs
a diversion, and I serve him

1480
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:19,040
in choosing as I chose.

1481
01:19:19,210 --> 01:19:21,440
As you can see, Captain,
the great thing is to gain time.

1482
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:23,070
To hold until the Marshal returns.

1483
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:24,980
- And to gain time?

1484
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:31,370
You will all be so kind
as to lay down your lives.

1485
01:19:39,610 --> 01:19:40,700
Christian?

1486
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:41,400
Yes.

1487
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:46,130
Roxane?

1488
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:49,260
I should like to say
farewell to her

1489
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:51,580
with my whole
heart for her to keep.

1490
01:19:53,630 --> 01:19:55,610
I have taken the liberty of...

1491
01:19:58,580 --> 01:20:03,760
(the first letter
Christian is aware of)

1492
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:05,110
But, wait.

1493
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:08,180
This little spot.

1494
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:09,360
Spot?

1495
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:10,100
Yes.

1496
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:11,550
A tear.

1497
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,210
Is nothing.

1498
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:16,860
A poet while he writes
is like a lover in his lady's arms,

1499
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:19,060
believing his imagination,
everything seems real.

1500
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:20,710
There's half the charm
of writing.

1501
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:24,000
Now, I made this letter
so pathetic, that,

1502
01:20:24,030 --> 01:20:27,290
while I was writing it,
I wept.

1503
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,110
You wept?

1504
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:31,590
Why, yes, because
it is a little thing to die,

1505
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:36,710
but not to see her,...
that is terrible.

1506
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:41,890
I shall never...,
you will never...

1507
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:43,690
Give me that.

1508
01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:48,500
- Halt. Who goes there.
- On the service of the King.

1509
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:01,330
- The King!
- Fall in...

1510
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:11,620
Good evening.

1511
01:21:11,650 --> 01:21:13,540
On the King's service, you?

1512
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,850
- Gentlemen,...
- What are you doing here?

1513
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:28,300
- We heard rumors at home
you were hungry,

1514
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:29,810
- so we came prepared.

1515
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:34,500
The Spaniards adored the fare,
but they missed the fowl!

1516
01:21:34,530 --> 01:21:37,560
(soldiers clamor for food)

1517
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:47,020
But why did you come here
into this, this danger?

1518
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:49,420
They said in Paris
there was no fighting.

1519
01:21:50,450 --> 01:21:53,620
Besides, it was your own fault.

1520
01:22:01,410 --> 01:22:03,770
Think of the
letters you have written me.

1521
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:06,510
How many times!
Every day!

1522
01:22:06,550 --> 01:22:07,680
Every day?

1523
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:08,820
Of course.

1524
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:11,560
And each one
more wonderful than the last.

1525
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,820
All this, for a few absurd love letters.

1526
01:22:14,860 --> 01:22:18,050
Hush. Absurd?
Your letters...no, never.

1527
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:22,730
Every one was like hearing your voice
that night in the dark. Remember?

1528
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:26,590
Like your arms around me.
I read them over and over.

1529
01:22:26,630 --> 01:22:30,420
Every page was like
a petal fallen from you soul.

1530
01:22:30,460 --> 01:22:33,350
Like the light
and the fire of a great love.

1531
01:22:33,390 --> 01:22:36,020
- Sweet and strong and true.
- Sweet.

1532
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:37,280
Strong.

1533
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:38,490
True?

1534
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:43,090
Oh, my Christian.

1535
01:22:43,690 --> 01:22:46,420
I came here to ask forgiveness.

1536
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:49,380
It is time to be forgiven.

1537
01:22:49,860 --> 01:22:51,950
Now, when we
may die so soon.

1538
01:22:53,780 --> 01:22:55,380
Forgive me for being
light and vain

1539
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:57,570
and loving you only
because you were handsome.

1540
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,230
- For now...
- Now?

1541
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:01,940
I love you for yourself.

1542
01:23:02,350 --> 01:23:04,090
For what you are.

1543
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:05,340
Roxane.

1544
01:23:05,910 --> 01:23:09,000
How you must have suffered.
For you saw how frivolous I was.

1545
01:23:09,030 --> 01:23:11,300
And to be loved
for the mere costume,

1546
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:14,090
for the poor, casual
body you went about in.

1547
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:17,620
To a soul like yours,
that must have been torture.

1548
01:23:17,650 --> 01:23:18,390
No.

1549
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,140
I understand.

1550
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:25,930
You cannot perfectly
believe in me,

1551
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:27,530
a...a love like this...

1552
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:29,090
I want no love like this.

1553
01:23:29,320 --> 01:23:31,020
I want love only for...

1554
01:23:31,050 --> 01:23:33,090
Only for what every
woman sees in you.

1555
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:35,030
I can to better than that.

1556
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:37,240
No, it...it was best before.

1557
01:23:38,360 --> 01:23:40,090
You do not
altogether know me.

1558
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:42,260
I was a child.

1559
01:23:42,350 --> 01:23:43,650
I'm a woman now.

1560
01:23:44,250 --> 01:23:46,720
- If...if you were less handsome,
- No.

1561
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:50,130
unattractive, ugly even,
I should love you, still.

1562
01:23:50,770 --> 01:23:51,900
Do you mean that?

1563
01:23:52,510 --> 01:23:53,750
I do mean that.

1564
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,020
Ugly?

1565
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:56,200
Even then.

1566
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,050
Now, are you happy?

1567
01:24:03,470 --> 01:24:04,650
Yes.

1568
01:24:04,690 --> 01:24:05,500
What is it?

1569
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:08,690
Nothing, only, Cyrano...

1570
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:10,830
Cyrano.

1571
01:24:12,050 --> 01:24:14,090
he has something
to tell you.

1572
01:24:16,180 --> 01:24:17,200
Where are you going?

1573
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:20,690
I...will...return...in a moment.

1574
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:30,050
Cyrano.

1575
01:24:30,650 --> 01:24:32,480
Your wife, sir,
she goes with me?

1576
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:33,340
No, sir, she remains.

1577
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:34,670
There is still time
for her to escape.

1578
01:24:34,710 --> 01:24:35,640
She stays!

1579
01:24:36,030 --> 01:24:36,790
Very well.

1580
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:38,950
Someone give me a musket.
I stay here also.

1581
01:24:39,420 --> 01:24:40,640
Sir, you show courage.

1582
01:24:40,670 --> 01:24:42,890
What, shall I run away,
and leave a woman?

1583
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:45,320
Colonel, my compliments, sir.

1584
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:47,810
What of Roxane?

1585
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:48,470
Wait.

1586
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:50,860
Well, what is it?
You look so...

1587
01:24:52,830 --> 01:24:54,580
She does not love me.

1588
01:24:54,990 --> 01:24:57,310
- You think not?
- She loves you.

1589
01:24:57,340 --> 01:24:59,630
- No.
- She loves only my soul.

1590
01:24:59,660 --> 01:25:00,370
- No.
- Yes!

1591
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,140
That means you.
And you love her.

1592
01:25:03,170 --> 01:25:05,300
- I?
- I see. I know.

1593
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:08,310
You wrote her,
everyday, every day!

1594
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:10,030
- Perfectly simple.
- Simple?

1595
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:11,700
For a month,
we've been blockaded here.

1596
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:13,340
How did you send
all those letters?

1597
01:25:13,370 --> 01:25:14,500
Before daylight
I managed...

1598
01:25:14,530 --> 01:25:16,070
To face death
everyday.

1599
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:17,950
You love her.

1600
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:20,190
Yes.

1601
01:25:26,950 --> 01:25:27,890
Tell her so.

1602
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:29,250
- No.
- Why not?

1603
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:32,290
Why?
Look at me.

1604
01:25:32,590 --> 01:25:35,420
She would love me
if I were ugly.

1605
01:25:35,990 --> 01:25:38,820
- She said that?
- Yes. Now, go to her.

1606
01:25:40,090 --> 01:25:42,410
Nonsense. Do not
believe any such madness.

1607
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:44,730
Go back to her.
You never will be ugly.

1608
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:45,810
Go!
It is you she loves.

1609
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:46,870
That is what
we shall see.

1610
01:25:46,900 --> 01:25:47,840
No, no!

1611
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:49,480
- Let her chose between us.
- No.

1612
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,510
- Tell her everything.
- Why do you torture me?

1613
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:54,700
Shall I ruin your happiness,
because I was born with a pretty face?

1614
01:25:54,740 --> 01:25:57,210
Am I to ruin yours,
because I happen to have power

1615
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:58,750
to say what you perhaps feel?

1616
01:25:58,780 --> 01:26:00,910
- Tell her!
- Don't drive me too far!

1617
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:03,210
- I'm tired of being my own rival.
- Hard to know.

1618
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,470
My secret marriage, that
can be annulled, I expect.

1619
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,790
I want her love
for the poor fool than I am,

1620
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:09,020
or not at all.

1621
01:26:09,390 --> 01:26:12,090
Oh, I'm going through with this.
I'll know one way or the other.

1622
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:15,280
Now, go!....Tell her.

1623
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:16,790
Let her chose one of  us.

1624
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:18,780
It will be you.

1625
01:26:19,670 --> 01:26:21,330
I hope so.

1626
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:33,820
- Captain!

1627
01:26:36,570 --> 01:26:38,100
The Spanish fires are going out.

1628
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:42,160
It begins.

1629
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:44,140
I need a scout. Where's Cyrano.

1630
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:45,280
Captain.

1631
01:26:45,850 --> 01:26:46,740
Let me go.

1632
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:49,490
No, my boy, Cyrano knows
the terrain. He knows their lines.

1633
01:26:49,530 --> 01:26:51,550
So do I.
Please, allow me.

1634
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:56,070
Very well.
We must know from which

1635
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:58,810
direction the advance comes.
Their weight and numbers.

1636
01:26:58,840 --> 01:26:59,560
I understand.

1637
01:27:11,940 --> 01:27:12,780
Roxane.

1638
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:14,450
Cyrano.

1639
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:15,930
Christian thinks...

1640
01:27:17,470 --> 01:27:19,190
Christian thinks you
ought to know that...

1641
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:20,240
But I do know.

1642
01:27:20,770 --> 01:27:22,850
He still doubts what I
just told him, just now.

1643
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,860
I saw that.

1644
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:27,560
Yes, but,...was it true,
what you told him just now?

1645
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:28,900
It was true.

1646
01:27:28,990 --> 01:27:32,270
I said that I should love him,
even if he were....

1647
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:34,580
The word comes
hard before me?

1648
01:27:37,420 --> 01:27:38,860
Say it, I shall
not be hurt.

1649
01:27:39,370 --> 01:27:40,620
Ugly?

1650
01:27:40,680 --> 01:27:42,130
Even, then
I should love him.

1651
01:27:43,500 --> 01:27:44,690
Disfigured.

1652
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:45,870
Or disfigured.

1653
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:49,620
Even....grotesque.

1654
01:27:49,650 --> 01:27:51,350
How could he
every be grotesque,

1655
01:27:51,810 --> 01:27:52,950
ever to me?

1656
01:27:52,990 --> 01:27:55,580
But, you could love him so,
as much as?

1657
01:27:55,610 --> 01:27:56,790
Yes, and more.

1658
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:58,320
Roxane...

1659
01:27:58,350 --> 01:27:59,300
(gunshot)

1660
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:00,260
What is it?

1661
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:02,600
Are they fighting?

1662
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:06,510
What is happening?

1663
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:08,010
- The Spaniards advance,

1664
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:09,930
but there is time.

1665
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,370
- Where is Christian?
- At the parapet.

1666
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:13,890
Oh, of course.

1667
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:16,750
What is it
that you wish to tell me?

1668
01:28:16,780 --> 01:28:18,140
Roxane,...

1669
01:28:18,810 --> 01:28:21,690
believe me this is difficult,
and for once I lack words.

1670
01:28:24,690 --> 01:28:26,330
Christian asked me to...

1671
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:27,850
He told me...

1672
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,220
Christian!

1673
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:42,970
To your places, gentlemen.

1674
01:28:43,970 --> 01:28:45,130
Is he dead?

1675
01:28:45,170 --> 01:28:46,260
No, but dying.

1676
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:47,660
I will not let him!

1677
01:28:51,870 --> 01:28:54,530
Cyrano...did you?

1678
01:28:54,570 --> 01:28:56,610
Yes, my friend.
I have told her.

1679
01:28:58,350 --> 01:28:59,450
She loves you.

1680
01:29:00,840 --> 01:29:02,190
Roxane.

1681
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:03,570
Yes, my darling.

1682
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:07,320
Christian!

1683
01:29:08,170 --> 01:29:09,370
He is not dead?

1684
01:29:10,930 --> 01:29:11,830
Yes.

1685
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:13,640
(gasp)

1686
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:22,890
Time you must go, now.

1687
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:25,860
Really, he is dead.

1688
01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:27,740
No one else
knew him but you.

1689
01:29:28,250 --> 01:29:29,630
Was he not a hero?

1690
01:29:29,670 --> 01:29:30,700
Yes, Roxane.

1691
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,340
A heart deeper
than we knew.

1692
01:29:33,380 --> 01:29:34,930
Yes, Roxane.

1693
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:39,310
A poet.
A soul magnificently tender.

1694
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:43,660
Yes, Roxane.

1695
01:29:44,840 --> 01:29:46,740
But he is dead now.

1696
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:50,030
(collapses sobbing)

1697
01:29:50,070 --> 01:29:51,230
Why, so am I.

1698
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:55,060
For I am dead
and my love mourns for me

1699
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:56,550
and does not know.

1700
01:29:58,190 --> 01:29:59,530
Will never know.

1701
01:29:59,570 --> 01:30:00,990
(rapid gunfire)

1702
01:30:01,030 --> 01:30:02,410
(bugle calls)

1703
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:04,030
Take her away quickly.

1704
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:06,500
Wait.

1705
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,220
A letter over his heart.

1706
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:12,850
(sobbing)

1707
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:18,460
I have two deaths
to avenge, now,

1708
01:30:19,090 --> 01:30:22,670
Christian's...and my own.

1709
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:42,210
(fighting becomes intense)

1710
01:30:43,330 --> 01:30:46,820
(the Spanish army advances)

1711
01:30:49,450 --> 01:30:50,280
Fire!

1712
01:31:00,270 --> 01:31:02,810
Surrender or you die!

1713
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:51,720
(de Guiche)
Look! The signal!

1714
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:00,940
Ah!

1715
01:33:07,070 --> 01:33:09,610
We fought. We died.
We fought again.

1716
01:33:09,750 --> 01:33:12,760
Who are these men who are
so fond of death, one Spaniard cried.

1717
01:33:12,840 --> 01:33:14,440
On and on, they came.

1718
01:33:14,570 --> 01:33:17,210
Then, when all seemed lost,
we heard the trumpets

1719
01:33:17,250 --> 01:33:19,850
of our returning troops.
The battle was ours!

1720
01:33:20,690 --> 01:33:24,050
Ah, you have been fortunate,
Ms. de Bergerac, you have lived!

1721
01:33:24,090 --> 01:33:28,870
While we, we waste our youth.
There is no war and not hope for any.

1722
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:30,880
No hope for any?

1723
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:34,220
My fellow, I just realize,
we are both fools.

1724
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:37,550
But mine is the greater folly,
for I am an older fool.

1725
01:33:38,170 --> 01:33:42,320
What is more......
Everything I told you was a lie.

1726
01:33:47,550 --> 01:33:49,680
Another satire
for the Gazette?

1727
01:33:49,710 --> 01:33:50,410
Yes.

1728
01:33:50,820 --> 01:33:53,480
Another glove flung
in the face of power?

1729
01:33:53,650 --> 01:33:55,400
Oh, why do you
do it, Cyrano?

1730
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:57,860
- Why do you attack...
- Stupidity?

1731
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:01,180
Deceit? Corruption?
I'm too old to change.

1732
01:34:01,370 --> 01:34:03,980
I'm an old dog
with nothing left but his teeth.

1733
01:34:04,010 --> 01:34:06,580
Ah, but teeth can be pulled.
That can be painful.

1734
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:14,580
That insolent wretch.
That scoundrel de Bergerac.

1735
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,180
This time he's gone too far.
I swear it.

1736
01:34:17,210 --> 01:34:18,790
He's signed his death warrant.

1737
01:34:19,950 --> 01:34:21,730
And who will deliver it?

1738
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:25,040
His sword is still very
powerful, my friend.

1739
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,230
There are may ways
a man can die.

1740
01:34:27,990 --> 01:34:29,550
Who knows?

1741
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:31,430
He may meet
with an accident.

1742
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:33,570
Soon.

1743
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:38,710
(church chimes)

1744
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:46,060
But, uh, tell me, Madame.

1745
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:50,830
How long will you continue
to remain here, forever in mourning?

1746
01:34:51,670 --> 01:34:52,570
Forever.

1747
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:55,080
Was Christian all that?

1748
01:34:55,770 --> 01:34:57,400
If you knew him
you would not ask.

1749
01:34:57,950 --> 01:35:00,150
His last letter
is still in my heart.

1750
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:04,770
And, uh, Cyrano?
Do you see him often?

1751
01:35:04,920 --> 01:35:09,240
Every week. My old friend
takes the place of my Gazette.

1752
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:11,320
He brings me all the news.

1753
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:14,940
Every Saturday under
that tree out there.

1754
01:35:14,980 --> 01:35:17,070
I wait for him embroidering.

1755
01:35:17,430 --> 01:35:20,240
The hour strikes.
I need not turn to look.

1756
01:35:20,570 --> 01:35:24,070
At the last stroke,
I hear his cane tapping the walk.

1757
01:35:24,100 --> 01:35:26,430
His satires have made
him many enemies.

1758
01:35:27,080 --> 01:35:29,740
But, they still fear
that sword of his.

1759
01:35:30,330 --> 01:35:32,130
No one dare touch him.

1760
01:35:32,510 --> 01:35:33,670
Hm, that may be so.

1761
01:35:35,620 --> 01:35:38,160
It is not violence
I fear for him,

1762
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:42,560
but solitude, poverty.
Old gray Decembers

1763
01:35:42,590 --> 01:35:45,350
stealing on wolf's feet
into his darkened room.

1764
01:35:46,010 --> 01:35:48,230
It seems to me he's
worn the same old coat

1765
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:49,610
for many months, now.

1766
01:35:49,650 --> 01:35:51,740
Eh, that is nothing
strange in this world.

1767
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:53,820
You need not pity
him overmuch.

1768
01:35:53,860 --> 01:35:56,930
He lives his life,
his own life his own way,

1769
01:35:56,970 --> 01:36:00,300
thought, word and deed free.

1770
01:36:00,450 --> 01:36:01,610
My Lord Duke.

1771
01:36:01,750 --> 01:36:05,860
Oh, yes, I know.
I have all. He has nothing.

1772
01:36:06,370 --> 01:36:12,170
Nevertheless, today,
I should be proud to shake his hand.

1773
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:14,000
Ah, well, adieu.

1774
01:36:14,670 --> 01:36:16,300
Will I ever see you again?

1775
01:36:16,340 --> 01:36:17,970
Come whenever you like.

1776
01:36:18,010 --> 01:36:19,610
Then, you have forgiven me.

1777
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:21,680
I am here.

1778
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:25,380
Do you know?
When a man wins

1779
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:29,750
everything in this world,
when he succeeds too much,

1780
01:36:29,790 --> 01:36:34,190
he feels, somehow,
a thousand small displeasures

1781
01:36:34,230 --> 01:36:38,560
with himself, whose whole sum
is not quite remorse

1782
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:45,570
but rather a sort of vague
disgust, dry illusions, pained regrets.

1783
01:36:45,870 --> 01:36:48,730
Yes, now and then,
I envy your Cyrano.

1784
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,860
The sentiment
does you honor.

1785
01:36:50,890 --> 01:36:52,250
(chuckling)

1786
01:36:59,350 --> 01:37:04,280
Madame, I must tell you,
it is true that no one has yet

1787
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:06,490
dared to attack
your friend Cyrano.

1788
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:11,380
Nevertheless, at the theater
last night, I heard some things.

1789
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:13,720
Keep him at home all you can.

1790
01:37:14,090 --> 01:37:17,330
Tomorrow when you see him,
tell him to be careful.

1791
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:19,130
I thank you.

1792
01:37:32,050 --> 01:37:33,140
(Cyrano)
Good night, Ragueneau.

1793
01:37:33,180 --> 01:37:35,120
(Ragueneau)
Cyrano, you not leaving?

1794
01:37:35,150 --> 01:37:37,030
You will not have
dinner here with me?

1795
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:38,860
(Cyrano)
My regrets. I have a magnificent

1796
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:42,450
roast waiting for me, a rare wine,
a gift from my publisher.

1797
01:37:42,490 --> 01:37:43,890
(Ragueneau)
Fine, to be sure.

1798
01:37:44,650 --> 01:37:47,490
Uh, have you seen
Moliere's new play?

1799
01:37:47,530 --> 01:37:48,160
No.

1800
01:37:48,340 --> 01:37:49,650
Heh, ah, well....

1801
01:37:49,690 --> 01:37:50,580
What is it?

1802
01:37:50,610 --> 01:37:51,460
Well, he...

1803
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:52,250
Speak.

1804
01:37:52,290 --> 01:37:55,220
He stole a scene
from you, word for word.

1805
01:37:55,250 --> 01:37:57,140
You know, "What the devil
was he doing there?"

1806
01:37:57,170 --> 01:37:57,730
That one.

1807
01:37:57,770 --> 01:37:59,040
He stole it, bodily.

1808
01:37:59,070 --> 01:38:01,300
Well, he showed
good taste.

1809
01:38:01,340 --> 01:38:03,020
It, uh, played well?

1810
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:05,450
Oh, beautifully. They
laughed and laughed.

1811
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:06,810
Oh, how they laughed.

1812
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:08,560
Moliere has genius.

1813
01:38:09,370 --> 01:38:11,010
Christian had good looks.

1814
01:38:12,170 --> 01:38:13,610
With me, it was
always thus.

1815
01:38:16,050 --> 01:38:17,240
Good night, my friend.

1816
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:32,950
(man)
Hold, there.

1817
01:38:33,160 --> 01:38:33,950
(man)
You!

1818
01:38:35,650 --> 01:38:36,850
(Cyrano)
Are you addressing me?

1819
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,990
Yes, you, Monsieur
of the long nose.

1820
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:40,000
Insolence.

1821
01:38:40,290 --> 01:38:41,990
- Foulmouthed scribbler.
- What?

1822
01:38:42,020 --> 01:38:43,440
- Lair, plagiarist!
- Liar.

1823
01:38:47,910 --> 01:38:49,660
(whistling to wagon)

1824
01:39:08,630 --> 01:39:10,920
(driver whips horses)

1825
01:39:27,570 --> 01:39:28,490
Doctor.

1826
01:39:29,930 --> 01:39:31,260
Why pretend?

1827
01:39:31,550 --> 01:39:32,910
It is very grave.

1828
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:35,500
Keep him quiet
at all costs.

1829
01:39:35,540 --> 01:39:38,500
If he attempts
to rise, he will die.

1830
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:39,810
Shhhh.

1831
01:39:43,220 --> 01:39:43,930
Thank you.

1832
01:39:44,980 --> 01:39:47,240
(door closes)

1833
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:55,820
(gate bell rings)

1834
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:01,490
(gate opens)

1835
01:40:01,530 --> 01:40:03,170
Monsieur.

1836
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:03,860
Ah, Sister.

1837
01:40:09,810 --> 01:40:10,880
(gasp)

1838
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,350
What is the matter
with you?

1839
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:15,900
Shall I tell you
something, Sister?

1840
01:40:16,540 --> 01:40:20,470
Yesterday, Friday, mind you,
I ate meat again.

1841
01:40:21,930 --> 01:40:23,000
Yes, I know.

1842
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:25,080
That is why you
are so pale.

1843
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:27,930
Please come to me
to the refectory before you go.

1844
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:30,250
I'll make you a great
bowl of hot soup.

1845
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:31,630
Of course, of course.

1846
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:33,950
You're quite reasonable today.

1847
01:40:33,990 --> 01:40:36,120
Perhaps you'll convert me.

1848
01:40:36,160 --> 01:40:38,260
Oh, no! Not for the world.

1849
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:40,690
Why, now I think of it,
that is so.

1850
01:40:41,070 --> 01:40:44,560
You, bursting with holiness,
and yet you never preach.

1851
01:40:45,470 --> 01:40:46,760
Astonishing.

1852
01:40:47,060 --> 01:40:49,100
And now I shall astonish you.

1853
01:40:49,690 --> 01:40:54,110
I'm going to let you
pray for me tonight, at Vespers.

1854
01:40:55,830 --> 01:40:58,700
Absolutely struck dumb, eh?

1855
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:05,180
I did not wait for you
to say I might.

1856
01:41:14,930 --> 01:41:17,450
Now may the devil admire
me if never hope to see

1857
01:41:17,490 --> 01:41:19,570
the end of that embroidery.

1858
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:23,440
After 14 years,
late for the first time.

1859
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:26,550
Yes.
Yes, maddening.

1860
01:41:27,330 --> 01:41:31,480
I was detained by
a visitor. Most unexpected.

1861
01:41:32,150 --> 01:41:33,660
An old friend of mine.

1862
01:41:34,540 --> 01:41:36,830
At least a very
old acquaintance.

1863
01:41:36,870 --> 01:41:38,320
Did you tell him
to go away?

1864
01:41:38,980 --> 01:41:40,410
For the time being, yes.

1865
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:45,270
I said excuse me,
I see that it's Saturday,

1866
01:41:45,620 --> 01:41:48,200
I have a previous
engagement.

1867
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:49,620
One I cannot miss.

1868
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:52,340
Even for you.

1869
01:41:53,250 --> 01:41:55,310
Come back an hour from now.

1870
01:41:55,420 --> 01:41:59,170
Your friend will have to wait.
I shall not let you go till dark.

1871
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:04,970
Perhaps a little before dark,
I must go.

1872
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:09,080
Oh, then tell me now
the court news. My Gazette.

1873
01:42:10,390 --> 01:42:14,190
Ah, yes, well, let me see.

1874
01:42:16,350 --> 01:42:20,840
Saturday, 19th, the King
fell ill after eight helpings of

1875
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:22,170
grape marmalade.

1876
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:26,320
Grape marmalade will
no longer be served at court.

1877
01:42:28,190 --> 01:42:33,010
Sunday, the royal pulse
is now normal.

1878
01:42:34,630 --> 01:42:37,930
Monday, everyone was
talking about the success

1879
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:39,600
of Moliere's new play.

1880
01:42:40,830 --> 01:42:46,110
Tuesday, the King fell ill
after six helpings of marone glacee.

1881
01:42:47,910 --> 01:42:50,130
Marone glacee will no
longer be served at court.

1882
01:42:51,710 --> 01:42:55,700
Wednesday, the Compte de Firske
spoke to Madame de Monte Glas.

1883
01:42:56,500 --> 01:42:59,380
She said....no.

1884
01:43:01,480 --> 01:43:07,450
Thursday.... Nothing.

1885
01:43:07,490 --> 01:43:10,580
Friday, Madame de Monte Glas
said yes.

1886
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:18,800
Saturday, 25th....

1887
01:43:19,450 --> 01:43:20,520
Cyrano!

1888
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:24,010
What is it?
Cyrano!

1889
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:31,300
- Oh, no, no, it is nothing.
- What?

1890
01:43:31,750 --> 01:43:34,200
The old wound at Arras
sometimes...

1891
01:43:34,230 --> 01:43:36,980
- My poor friend.
- No, no, no, it is nothing.

1892
01:43:37,830 --> 01:43:39,350
It will soon be gone.

1893
01:43:41,010 --> 01:43:44,990
(gasp) There. 'Tis gone.

1894
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:48,480
We all have
our old wounds.

1895
01:43:49,020 --> 01:43:53,920
I have mine here,
under this faded scrap of writing.

1896
01:43:55,380 --> 01:43:57,340
It's hard to read now.

1897
01:43:58,370 --> 01:44:01,340
All for the blots
and tears.

1898
01:44:01,370 --> 01:44:02,560
His letter?

1899
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:06,650
Did you not promise me,
that someday you would let me read it?

1900
01:44:07,090 --> 01:44:12,350
- This letter? You wish...?
- I do wish it....today.

1901
01:44:22,650 --> 01:44:24,230
Open it and read.

1902
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:54,660
"Farewell, Roxane,
because today I die."

1903
01:44:54,690 --> 01:44:56,000
Aloud?

1904
01:44:57,180 --> 01:45:00,150
"I know that it will be today,
my own dearly beloved.

1905
01:45:01,630 --> 01:45:04,900
"Yet, my heart still so heavy
with love I have not told.

1906
01:45:06,440 --> 01:45:11,330
"And I shall die without telling you.

1907
01:45:11,900 --> 01:45:15,740
"No more shall my eyes
drink the sight of you like wine,

1908
01:45:16,230 --> 01:45:19,180
"never more with a look
that is a kiss,

1909
01:45:19,740 --> 01:45:22,430
"follow the sweet
grace of you."

1910
01:45:22,470 --> 01:45:24,400
How you read it.
His letter.

1911
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:26,300
"I remember now the way you have

1912
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:30,280
"of pushing back a lock of hair
with one hand from your forehead,

1913
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:33,270
- "and my heart cries out..."
- His letter!

1914
01:45:33,310 --> 01:45:35,000
- "cries out and keeps crying."

1915
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:38,240
- You read it so...
- "Farewell, my dear, my dearest,"

1916
01:45:38,270 --> 01:45:40,650
- In a voice...
- "my own heart's own,"

1917
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:44,230
- "my own treasure,"
- In such a voice!
- "my...love."

1918
01:45:44,260 --> 01:45:47,140
Yes, I remember hearing long ago.

1919
01:45:47,490 --> 01:45:52,210
"I am never away from you.
Even now I shall not leave you.

1920
01:45:53,110 --> 01:45:56,360
"In another world, I shall
still be that one who loves you,

1921
01:45:56,390 --> 01:46:00,110
"loves you beyond measure,
beyond..."

1922
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:11,130
But, how can you read it now?

1923
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:17,810
And all those 14 years
he has been the old friend

1924
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:19,650
who came to me to be amusing.

1925
01:46:20,930 --> 01:46:23,170
- Roxane.
- It was you.

1926
01:46:23,910 --> 01:46:24,880
No, no, Roxane, no.

1927
01:46:24,920 --> 01:46:28,100
And I might have know it every time
that I heard you speak my name.

1928
01:46:28,130 --> 01:46:31,690
- No, it was not I.
- It was you!
- I swear.

1929
01:46:32,460 --> 01:46:34,810
- The letters. That was you.
- No.

1930
01:46:35,140 --> 01:46:38,960
- And the dear foolish words.
That was you.
- No.

1931
01:46:39,190 --> 01:46:43,290
- And the voice in the dark.
That was you.
- On my honor!

1932
01:46:43,330 --> 01:46:47,170
And the soul.
It was all you.

1933
01:46:47,270 --> 01:46:49,180
I never loved you.

1934
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:50,850
Yes, you loved me.

1935
01:46:50,970 --> 01:46:52,740
Even now you love me.

1936
01:46:53,660 --> 01:46:55,610
(gasp)
No!

1937
01:46:55,650 --> 01:46:57,920
And twice you're great to know.

1938
01:46:57,950 --> 01:47:00,760
Oh, no, no, my own dear love,
I love you not.

1939
01:47:03,340 --> 01:47:05,840
Why were you silent
for so many years?

1940
01:47:06,580 --> 01:47:07,860
All the while.

1941
01:47:08,090 --> 01:47:11,110
Every night, and every day,
he gave me nothing.

1942
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:13,120
You knew that.

1943
01:47:13,720 --> 01:47:16,680
You knew in that letter
lying on my breast.

1944
01:47:17,940 --> 01:47:19,230
Your tears.

1945
01:47:20,580 --> 01:47:22,770
You knew they
were your tears.

1946
01:47:26,390 --> 01:47:28,270
The blood was his.

1947
01:47:29,370 --> 01:47:30,200
Cyrano!

1948
01:47:32,690 --> 01:47:34,320
Here! He's here.

1949
01:47:34,490 --> 01:47:36,270
Oh, what recklessness.

1950
01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:36,570
No.

1951
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:37,430
I knew it!

1952
01:47:37,490 --> 01:47:40,440
- Oh Madame he has killed
himself coming here.
- No. Shh.

1953
01:47:40,700 --> 01:47:42,220
That drink is, what is it?

1954
01:47:42,290 --> 01:47:45,510
Nothing. I did not
finish my Gazette.

1955
01:47:46,600 --> 01:47:49,970
Saturday, 26th, an hour
or so before dinner

1956
01:47:50,540 --> 01:47:55,340
Ms. de Bergerac died,
foully murdered.

1957
01:47:55,690 --> 01:47:57,470
Cyrano, what have
they done to you?

1958
01:47:57,600 --> 01:47:59,540
How fate loves a jest.

1959
01:47:59,980 --> 01:48:03,000
Behold me ambushed,
taken unawares.

1960
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:08,830
My noble foe, a lackey.
My battlefield, a gutter.

1961
01:48:09,490 --> 01:48:10,950
It seems too logical.

1962
01:48:11,370 --> 01:48:13,040
They have missed everything,

1963
01:48:13,820 --> 01:48:15,290
even my death.

1964
01:48:16,330 --> 01:48:17,950
Sisters! Sisters!

1965
01:48:17,990 --> 01:48:21,350
No, do not go away.
I may not be here when you return.

1966
01:48:22,030 --> 01:48:23,760
You shall not die.

1967
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:25,460
(sobbing)
I love you.

1968
01:48:25,490 --> 01:48:27,410
No, my lady,
it's not in the story.

1969
01:48:28,100 --> 01:48:29,900
When beauty said
I love you to the beast

1970
01:48:29,930 --> 01:48:32,990
all his ugliness changed
and dissolved, like magic.

1971
01:48:33,550 --> 01:48:37,370
But, you see,
I am still the same.

1972
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:39,430
And I have
done this to you.

1973
01:48:39,470 --> 01:48:40,620
You? Why no.

1974
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:42,060
All my fault, mine!

1975
01:48:42,100 --> 01:48:43,320
On the contrary.

1976
01:48:44,060 --> 01:48:47,080
I have never know womanhood
in its sweetness, but for you.

1977
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:50,750
My mother did not
like to look at me.

1978
01:48:52,050 --> 01:48:53,530
I never had a sister.

1979
01:48:54,880 --> 01:49:01,130
Later, I feared those sweethearts
with mockery behind her smile.

1980
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:06,150
But, because of you,
I have had across my life

1981
01:49:06,930 --> 01:49:10,600
one whispering, silken gown.

1982
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:15,200
I never loved but
one man in my life.

1983
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:18,680
I have lost him, twice.

1984
01:49:19,660 --> 01:49:23,540
(sobbing)

1985
01:49:23,570 --> 01:49:27,890
I would not have you mourning
any less that good, noble Christian.

1986
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:32,570
But, perhaps, I ask only this,

1987
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:36,370
when the great cold
gathers around my bones,

1988
01:49:37,770 --> 01:49:42,590
you may give a double
meaning to your widow's weeds.

1989
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:50,900
The tears you let fall for him,
may for a little, be my tears.

1990
01:49:51,080 --> 01:49:53,040
Oh, my love!

1991
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:58,400
No, not here.
Not lying down.

1992
01:49:58,720 --> 01:50:01,300
Let no one help me.
No one need help me.

1993
01:50:06,310 --> 01:50:07,430
It is coming.

1994
01:50:08,260 --> 01:50:11,460
I feel already shod with marble.

1995
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:13,950
Gloved with lead.

1996
01:50:14,730 --> 01:50:16,700
Very well,
let the old fellow come now.

1997
01:50:17,190 --> 01:50:19,600
He shall find me
on my feet.

1998
01:50:21,670 --> 01:50:23,120
Sword in hand.

1999
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:24,110
Cyrano!

2000
01:50:24,500 --> 01:50:25,890
He'd delirious.

2001
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:28,000
I see him now.

2002
01:50:28,040 --> 01:50:28,700
He grins.

2003
01:50:28,740 --> 01:50:30,750
He is looking at my nose!

2004
01:50:30,790 --> 01:50:31,820
That skeleton.

2005
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:33,730
You there.

2006
01:50:33,970 --> 01:50:34,670
Who are you?

2007
01:50:35,560 --> 01:50:36,950
A hundred against one, eh?

2008
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:40,020
I know them now,
my ancient enemies.

2009
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:40,960
Falsehood, there!

2010
01:50:41,240 --> 01:50:42,470
There, Prejudice!

2011
01:50:42,490 --> 01:50:44,100
Compromise, Cowardice.

2012
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:47,160
What's that?
Surrender? No, never!

2013
01:50:47,190 --> 01:50:48,430
Never!

2014
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:50,820
Ah, you too, Vanity.

2015
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:54,180
I knew you would
overthrow me in the end.

2016
01:50:54,210 --> 01:50:57,310
No, I fight, I fight on,
I fight....ow!

2017
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:01,000
(gasping)

2018
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:08,550
All my laurels
you have riven away.

2019
01:51:10,290 --> 01:51:11,770
And my roses.

2020
01:51:12,940 --> 01:51:15,600
Yet, in spite of you,
there is one crown

2021
01:51:15,630 --> 01:51:16,980
I made away with me.

2022
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:20,380
And tonight when I
enter before God,

2023
01:51:21,850 --> 01:51:27,140
my salute shall sweep away
the stars from the blue threshold.

2024
01:51:28,310 --> 01:51:33,240
One thing without stain,
unspotted from the world,

2025
01:51:34,240 --> 01:51:40,610
in spite of doom, mine own,
...and that is...

2026
01:51:43,220 --> 01:51:51,220
my...white...plume...
