1
00:01:36,162 --> 00:01:38,027
- Mr. Moon?
- Yes?

2
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:41,165
- My name's Claude.
- So?

3
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:44,463
I have an appointment with you.

4
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,630
- Who made it?
- Mr. Brink.

5
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,270
Come in.

6
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,072
Sit down.

7
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:08,417
- What do you want?
- A job.

8
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:13,393
- You'd like to work for me?
- Yes, sir. I'd like to work for you.

9
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,367
- Do you know what business I'm in?
- No, sir.

10
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:19,170
- Mr. Brink didn't tell you?
- No, sir.

11
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,434
- Didn't you ask him?
- No, sir.

12
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:25,005
- Why do you keep calling me "sir"?
- I respect you.

13
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:32,484
I'm a retired real estate broker.
I don't do anything anymore

14
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:36,750
but sit in my room, read,
look at television, and smoke cigars.

15
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,621
I'd still like to work for you.

16
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,156
- Doing what?
- I want to be a contractor.

17
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,397
- Have you done it before?
- No, sir.

18
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,528
You can only make a mistake
once in this job.

19
00:02:50,603 --> 00:02:52,969
- Well, I'm different.
- What do you mean, you're different?

20
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,406
- I don't make mistakes.
- Then how come you're out of a job?

21
00:02:56,476 --> 00:03:01,243
I'm not. I've got a steady job. I make
a nice income. Pension. Fringe benefits.

22
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,681
- So?
- So, I wanna improve myself.

23
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:08,143
I wanna buy a certain house
on the Ohio River.

24
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,712
With my salary, it'd take about 23 years.

25
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,384
I can't wait. I want to work for you.

26
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,995
Mr. Brink was kidding.
I'm a retired real estate broker.

27
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,733
- Yes, sir.
- Goodbye.

28
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:31,233
Goodbye, sir.
I appreciate your talking to me.

29
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,611
- Do you have a phone?
- Yes, sir.

30
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,081
- Write it down.
- I never put anything down on paper.

31
00:03:38,117 --> 00:03:42,178
- Smart boy.
- The number's OP 7-2468.

32
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,490
- 7-2468. I'll call you.
- Thank you.

33
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:51,326
Maybe tomorrow, next week, or next month.
If you're not in, I won't call back.

34
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,256
Goodbye, sir.

35
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,746
Mr. Brink? Moon.

36
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:21,859
He just left. I don't know
what to make of him. He's too smart.

37
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:27,256
You think so, huh?
All right, maybe we can use him.

38
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:34,131
Let's see if he passes the examination first.
Let him sit home and sweat for two weeks.

39
00:05:44,877 --> 00:05:45,935
Hey.

40
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,948
Hello?

41
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:30,113
Yes, sir, this is Claude. Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, I'll be there in 10 minutes.

42
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:47,328
- You look relaxed.
- I feel relaxed.

43
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:51,375
What have you been doing
the past two weeks?

44
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:54,675
- Waiting for your call.
- How'd you know I'd call?

45
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:57,939
You need me.

46
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:02,787
- Didn't you get restless?
- If I get restless, I exercise.

47
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,954
- My girl lives in Cleveland.
- Well, this is not Cleveland.

48
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:13,328
- I don't like pigs.
- I do.

49
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,325
Human nature.

50
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:21,305
- Did you bring your gun?
- I don't have a gun.

51
00:07:21,374 --> 00:07:24,366
- Knife?
- I don't even carry a room key.

52
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:28,175
You're a smart boy.

53
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,080
Your first contract.

54
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:36,647
Thank you.

55
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:41,086
- You're not gonna count it?
- It wouldn't pay you to cheat me.

56
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:46,689
You're smart, smart.
I'll call you, Claude. Goodbye.

57
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,939
- Goodbye, sir.
- I'll let you know the name and the address.

58
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,874
Thank you very much.

59
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:26,519
<i>Dr. Walders wanted in Surgery.</i>
<i>Dr. Walders, Surgery.</i>

60
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,628
- Who's there?
- It's me, Claude.

61
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,165
I thought I told you
never to come here again, Claude.

62
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:41,433
I know that, sir.

63
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:44,635
- You got your pay, didn't you?
- Same as always.

64
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:47,679
You get paid whether you work or not.
Why'd you come?

65
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:50,045
- Mr. Brink sent me.
- For what?

66
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,290
Yes, Mr. Brink. Yes, sir. Los Angeles?

67
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,755
Why, no, sir, I've never been there.

68
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,528
Yes, sir. Bye-bye.

69
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:24,178
<i>Attention, please.</i>
<i>The Coronado Limited now arriving on...</i>

70
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,581
Well, it's on time, anyway.

71
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:29,886
Why didn't he fly out? Takes 10 hours.
Instead of wasting three days on a train.

72
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:33,015
You're nervous. Don't stay up so late.

73
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,620
The trial is on the 18th.
All we got is two weeks.

74
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:41,326
- All it takes is one little minute.
- That's all it takes in the gas chamber.

75
00:11:42,068 --> 00:11:47,199
Don't be so pessimistic. It's not your job.
He's got to fill the contract, not us.

76
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,537
We're just messenger boys.

77
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:52,702
A federal trial, a guy's gotta be crazy
to fill a contract like that.

78
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:55,747
Do you think the Chief would
send a crazy man 3,000 miles?

79
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,909
Well, if he ain't crazy, he's greedy,
and that's just as bad.

80
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:02,852
Well, so he's greedy. So what?

81
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:10,793
- He's making five grand on the job.
- Five grand? A guy could really live on that.

82
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,693
Yeah, but how long can a guy like that live?

83
00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,600
Boy, while it lasts, it's pretty gorgeous.

84
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:20,929
Marc, would you take a job like that?
I mean, really, would you?

85
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:22,906
- Wouldn't you?
- Me?

86
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,806
No, I'm not that ambitious.

87
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,660
Come on, let's go meet him.

88
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:29,700
- I guess you'd like to freshen up.
- Not especially. I feel fine, just fine.

89
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:33,276
You hungry?

90
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:36,041
Had a fine breakfast on the train
about an hour ago.

91
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:39,573
Better get you back to the hotel.
We got a lot to talk about.

92
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,382
It's a shame to get cooped up in a room
on a fine day like this.

93
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:45,685
- I'd like to drive around a bit, see the sights.
- I seen the sights.

94
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,453
Well, I haven't.

95
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,800
Look, man, we'd like to get this over with,
you know. It's no picnic.

96
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,165
My name's Claude.

97
00:14:03,108 --> 00:14:07,511
- I'm George. He's Marc.
- Pleased to meet you, boys.

98
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:12,583
Now that we've said hello,
let's see how fast we can say goodbye.

99
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:15,284
Listen, pal, we don't wanna rush you,

100
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:19,723
but we're anxious to get it done with.
You know, the trial's on the 18th.

101
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:23,990
Well, I don't do rush contracts.
I may be on this an hour, a day, or a week.

102
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:27,396
- A week?
- My deal with the Chief is I call the time.

103
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:31,732
Whatever you say, Claude.
Whatever you say.

104
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:34,269
Where do we go?

105
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,400
I'd like to see the Pacific Ocean.
Do you mind?

106
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,887
We got you a nice, quiet room.

107
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:26,048
I don't like it, George.
I tell you, I don't like it.

108
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,424
All these contractors are oddballs.
They gotta be.

109
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,965
Odd? This guy's weird.
He don't even ask who the target is.

110
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:36,900
Well, wait till he finds out.
He won't be so relaxed.

111
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:39,096
Tomorrow, he wants to go deep-sea fishing.

112
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:42,163
So, tomorrow we'll take him
deep-sea fishing.

113
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:47,678
Claude, you don't want to
really go deep-sea fishing, do you?

114
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,738
My pa always told me that when a guy's
got something mighty important to do,

115
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:52,977
he better take time to plan.

116
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:57,386
And I can't think of any better way to plan
than sitting behind a fishing pole.

117
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,050
Sitting gives a man patience to think.
There's too many doers in the world.

118
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:04,323
- Not enough people take time to think.
- He wants to go deep-sea fishing.

119
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,660
You filled many contracts, Claude?

120
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,428
That's a silly question to ask me,
Georgie boy.

121
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,765
Now, if I told you,
that'd be two of us that knew.

122
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:15,534
That's two too many.
Now, be a good boy and dry my back.

123
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,884
Monday, he went swimming.

124
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,954
Tuesday, he went fishing.

125
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:31,318
Yesterday, he went to the zoo.

126
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,625
And not one word about the target.

127
00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:37,288
He ain't even asked who it is.

128
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,189
I tell you, I don't like it, George.
I don't like it at all.

129
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,930
- You're repeating yourself.
- I'm going to tell him now.

130
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:49,236
Well, good morning. Why aren't you guys
out in that fine, fresh air?

131
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,934
What's the schedule today?

132
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:56,505
The circus is in town. We could go down
and feed peanuts to the elephants.

133
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:01,185
Have you boys ever killed anybody?

134
00:17:02,621 --> 00:17:03,679
Well?

135
00:17:05,924 --> 00:17:07,516
I thought not.

136
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,053
It's not easy, you know.

137
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,031
You read in the paper about some wife
doing away with her husband,

138
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:22,870
child murderer, knifing in a tavern brawl...

139
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:26,399
These are crimes of passion.
Crazy people off their rocker.

140
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:30,039
Then there's the trigger-happy hoodlum,
the kid that kills a gas station attendant

141
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:33,516
because he can't open
the cash register fast enough.

142
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:38,555
That's another type of crazy person.
Both types eventually get caught.

143
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,120
They don't plan. They can't.

144
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,893
Even if they did, it'd be no use.

145
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:49,991
The only type of killing that's safe
is when a stranger kills a stranger.

146
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:54,062
No motive.
Nothing to link the victim to the executioner.

147
00:17:55,607 --> 00:18:00,169
Now, why would a stranger kill a stranger?
Because somebody's willing to pay.

148
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,374
It's business. Same as any other business.

149
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:09,044
You murder the competition.
Instead of price-cutting, throat-cutting.

150
00:18:09,555 --> 00:18:10,544
Same thing.

151
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,624
There are a lot of people around
that would like

152
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:16,752
to see lots of other people die a fast death.

153
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,297
Only they can't see to it themselves.

154
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:22,492
They got conscience, religion, families.

155
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:25,765
They're afraid of punishment,
here or hereafter.

156
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:30,070
Me, I can't be bothered
with any of that nonsense.

157
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:35,778
I look at it like a good business.
The risk is high, but so is the profit.

158
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:39,809
- You're a real Superman, ain't you?
- Let him talk, Marc.

159
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:43,487
I like when he talks. It's educational.

160
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:50,084
I wasn't born this way. I trained myself.
I eliminate personal feeling.

161
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:55,423
You were born like everybody else.
Flesh and blood. You gotta feel!

162
00:18:56,301 --> 00:19:01,364
I feel hot. I feel cold.
I get sleepy, and I get hungry.

163
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,570
Today is the 8th. We got 10 days,
that's all. Ten days!

164
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,772
Plenty of time.

165
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,906
You want the money, don't you?
Don't you want the money?

166
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,919
I wanna do a good job.
When you do a good job, the money comes.

167
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:19,788
But when? When are you gonna do it?
You haven't even seen the target.

168
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,020
I'll tell you when.

169
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:25,362
Now, both you guys get out of here.
You're beginning to irritate me.

170
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:55,449
- Is that how you bring all your orders?
- Isn't this what you ordered, sir?

171
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,961
Take a look at that coffee cup.

172
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:00,988
There's lipstick on that coffee cup.

173
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:04,467
I don't like to drink coffee out of a cup
some lousy pig left their trademark on.

174
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,471
- You call yourself a waiter?
- I'm sorry, sir.

175
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:11,475
You're sorry. Sure, you're sorry.
You're sorry you gotta work for a living.

176
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,306
You're sorry maybe you're alive altogether.

177
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:18,406
If you're in a bind, don't bug me with it.
Get out of it yourself! What's your name?

178
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:21,818
- Harry.
- Why are you scared, Harry?

179
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,657
- I'm not scared, sir.
- Wanna bet you are?

180
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,058
You're too scared to add yourself up.
That's why you're doing such a lousy job

181
00:20:30,128 --> 00:20:32,653
of bringing me a cup with lipstick
to sweeten the coffee.

182
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:36,223
'Cause you're too far gone to care anymore.
Why are you miserable?

183
00:20:36,301 --> 00:20:39,998
'Cause you haven't got any dough?
And why haven't you got any dough?

184
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,267
Because you're too scared to
go out and get it yourself.

185
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,899
You want it to come to you.

186
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:48,140
Well, nothing comes to you, Harry, nothing.
Except one thing, death.

187
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:53,683
Death comes to you. Comes to everybody.
Only everybody thinks they'll live forever.

188
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,452
There's a laugh.
They think they'll live forever.

189
00:20:57,522 --> 00:21:01,219
The way I see it, Harry,
everybody lives off everybody else.

190
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,887
Who do you live off? Guys like me?

191
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:08,365
Where would you be
if it wasn't for guys like me, out of a job?

192
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:14,637
Look at this. Dust over everything. Dust!
Whose job is this, somebody else's?

193
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:17,573
Only it never gets done,
just like that coffee cup with lipstick,

194
00:21:17,643 --> 00:21:21,374
full of lipstick, full of disease!
And you get paid to carry it around.

195
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,073
Well, for my money,
you can get me a clean cup!

196
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,548
- Now go out of here and get it!
- Yes, sir.

197
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,450
Wait a minute. I'll sign the tab.

198
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:30,518
Yes, sir.

199
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,022
Here. This is for you.

200
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:40,596
$5 for me?

201
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,226
- Don't you want it?
- Thank you, sir.

202
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:53,741
You know, I'm beginning to like it out here.
Sunshine every day, reminds me of Miami.

203
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,610
- When were you in Miami?
- Was I in Miami?

204
00:21:56,682 --> 00:22:00,049
- You just said it reminded you of Miami.
- You ought to be a lawyer.

205
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:02,450
Ain't you driven around enough?

206
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,247
It sure is nice.

207
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:09,091
Hey, Claude,
if we turn right at the next block,

208
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,460
I can take you up Coldwater Canyon
and show you the house.

209
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:13,555
Whose house?

210
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:16,567
The hit's.
You want to see the location, don't you?

211
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:21,231
- Sure, George, sure.
- Hey, you should've turned right there.

212
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:26,505
Not today. It's too nice today.
Can't be bothered with stuff like that.

213
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:32,773
Sure is nice.

214
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:53,997
- He must be a genius in his own field.
- He's a genius, and I'm dying.

215
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:57,234
That guy's poison. Give me a light.

216
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,375
Haven't got a light.

217
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:06,813
What are we gonna do, George?
If we could just call long distance.

218
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,877
We can't call long distance. You know that.

219
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,549
We're sitting on a real volcano.
It could blow up any minute.

220
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:20,154
He's out there driving golf balls.
I'd like to drive a nail in his head.

221
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,459
He doesn't even care.
Real genius, like I said.

222
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:31,298
We gotta be seen trailing around after him,
like we're on a vacation or something.

223
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,778
He's finished. At last.

224
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,668
- Cards?
- Yeah.

225
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,630
- Pinochle?
- What, pinochle?

226
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:04,904
Casino.

227
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:12,842
I'm going out.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.

228
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:16,046
- Mind a little company?
- That's not in my contract.

229
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:19,249
Everything is in your contract
until you fill your contract.

230
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:22,623
- He's right, Claude.
- Okay, let's go to the movies.

231
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,062
- Where did he go?
- You were sitting right next to him.

232
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:05,295
Why didn't you watch him?

233
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,634
- Suppose they pick him up.
- Who's gonna pick him up?

234
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,640
He didn't do anything.

235
00:25:10,976 --> 00:25:12,841
It's our job to see
he doesn't get out of our sight.

236
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:17,280
- Why didn't you keep an eye on him?
- He slipped out like a cat. Just like a cat.

237
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,044
We'll be a couple of dead cats
if we don't find him.

238
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:20,982
Let's get out of here and look for him.

239
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:23,612
- Where are you gonna look?
- I don't know, but let's go.

240
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,316
We're not gonna find him sitting here.

241
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:35,130
- Where have you been?
- Watching you two guys.

242
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,058
- What do you mean?
- I waited outside the theater.

243
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:42,530
- I followed you everywhere you went.
- What for?

244
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:46,104
I wanted to make sure
you didn't have a tail on you.

245
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:49,010
I know I'm clean.
I know nobody followed me from the east.

246
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,914
- But I wasn't sure of you two.
- That's why you were stalling?

247
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,421
Today is the 14th. I feel like a calendar.

248
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:01,220
We got four days, that's all. Four days!

249
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:05,119
Tomorrow you can show me the hit.

250
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:43,228
- What's the name of the target?
- Billie Williams.

251
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:46,900
Lives in that little house
halfway up the other hill.

252
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,340
- Lot of men moving around down there.
- Fuzz.

253
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:55,879
- What?
- Fuzz.

254
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:59,317
Cops. Detectives.

255
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:01,784
Where you been all your life?
You talk like a citizen.

256
00:27:01,853 --> 00:27:05,516
Well, you'll have to bear with me.
I'm just learning the trade.

257
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,820
Honest, Claude,
you never served time before?

258
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:08,984
Nope.

259
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,392
- Not even reform school?
- No.

260
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:15,498
What have you been doing
with yourself all your life?

261
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,832
Studied. Built myself up.
Went through high school.

262
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:20,302
Commercial course.

263
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:24,871
- Today, I'm an expert comptometer operator.
- You got a big career ahead of you.

264
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:29,778
- Yeah, $76.20 a week before taxes.
- Billie Williams is there now.

265
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:34,248
Can't see him.

266
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,117
There's a woman standing in the way.
Who's that, his wife?

267
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:38,678
No, it's her.

268
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,793
- What?
- The target is a woman.

269
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:50,663
Are you kidding?
I thought you said Billie Williams.

270
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,828
That's right, Claude. Billie Williams.

271
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:56,101
She was a piano part of a trio
before she was sponsored

272
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,835
by you-know-who.

273
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,298
Where you going?

274
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:01,504
Look, I'm going to call New York,
renegotiate this whole deal.

275
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,139
What does he think I am, a sucker?

276
00:28:04,716 --> 00:28:07,981
Claude. Claude, I wouldn't do that
if I was you.

277
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:12,817
Why didn't they tell me it was a woman?
Why didn't they tell me?

278
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:16,122
Tell you?
They don't have to tell you nothing.

279
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:19,254
How are they supposed to know
you was chicken.

280
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:22,493
Trying to make me mad, huh?
But you're not going to succeed.

281
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:26,765
- I'm not scared, and you know it.
- He's not chicken, Marc. He's not chicken.

282
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:30,569
He's a good boy.
He just doesn't like to damage a woman.

283
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:35,040
It's not a matter of sex.
It's a matter of money.

284
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,547
If I'd have known it was a woman,
I'd have asked double.

285
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:40,448
I don't like women. They don't stand still.

286
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:45,649
When they move, it's hard to figure out
why or wherefore. They're not dependable.

287
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,887
It's tough to kill somebody
who's not dependable.

288
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:53,196
I'll do it, but I want more money.

289
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:58,497
I'm not authorized to pay you
a penny more than expenses.

290
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,595
Then I'll do what I said.
I'll call the Chief myself.

291
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:04,768
- Don't do that, Claude. Please, don't.
- No, no, I wouldn't do that, Superman.

292
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:09,906
- Why not?
- He might not agree.

293
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:16,652
- Well, if he doesn't agree, the deal's off.
- The deal's off. The deal's off, you're dead.

294
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:21,190
Come on, let's get going. I got lots to do.

295
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,513
Miss Wiley?

296
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:48,809
Well, well! Come in, stranger.

297
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:51,048
You think I'm drunk, don't you?

298
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,090
- Are you?
- Yes, I am.

299
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:57,891
I'm drunk and I'm mad, and I'm sore
at my landlord. And I'm sore at the world.

300
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:00,357
Here, handsome, gonna help me paint?

301
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:04,026
Or are you just going to stand there
and decorate the premises?

302
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:08,539
- Hey, your name Joe?
- My name is Bartholomew. J.J. Bartholomew.

303
00:30:08,606 --> 00:30:10,733
I'm with
the Federal Star Insurance Company.

304
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,471
Funny, you look just like Joe.

305
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:16,981
You're cute. A little too cute,
if you know what I mean.

306
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:19,516
But I don't need any insurance right today.

307
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:23,452
Can't afford it. Got no job.
And I'm drunk and I'm mad.

308
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:25,580
I could afford a magazine maybe.

309
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:29,286
You got any magazines to sell?
Or a vacuum cleaner?

310
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:33,729
You could demonstrate a vacuum cleaner
for me any old time.

311
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:39,094
You've got it the wrong way around.
I'm going to pay you.

312
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:44,141
- Now, wait a little minute.
- For some facts, information.

313
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:46,676
Information.

314
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:51,606
Information. I got lots of information.
That's about all I got.

315
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,844
You remember that what's-her-name starlet?

316
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:56,250
Got caught
with the wrong brand of cigarettes

317
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,619
in the headlines about two years ago?

318
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,523
Well, I used to work for her
as a personal maid.

319
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:04,221
One morning, I come into her boudoir
and you know what she...

320
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:06,627
- Miss Wiley.
- Yeah, honey?

321
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:10,258
- I'm not interested in her.
- Who then? Me?

322
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:13,168
- Billie Williams.
- Why?

323
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:18,071
Well, my insurance company's got
a policy issued to her. $100,000.

324
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:19,837
So, we'd like some information.

325
00:31:19,911 --> 00:31:22,880
- Well, I'll tell you one thing.
- Please do.

326
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:24,710
She's scared.

327
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:28,711
- Scared? Why?
- She's scared.

328
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:32,916
She fired me two days ago without notice.
Oh, she gave me a bonus.

329
00:31:33,424 --> 00:31:38,953
What hurts is, she don't trust me.
Wanted nothing but cops around her house.

330
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,764
- What does she do all day?
- Nothing.

331
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,563
- That's impossible.
- Course it is, but it's a fact.

332
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:47,070
She's an expert at doing nothing.

333
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:50,104
- What does she do all morning?
- TV.

334
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:54,804
Turns it on the minute she wakes up,
like some people reach for a cigarette.

335
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,814
- And then what?
- Then nothing.

336
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:01,784
Watches TV, does her eyes,
reads the newspaper,

337
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:03,980
listens to TV at the same time.

338
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,819
Now, there's a disgusting habit.

339
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:10,691
- What does she eat for lunch?
- Soup with matzo balls.

340
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:14,926
The cops bring it by squad car,
sirens screaming all the way

341
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,728
from Beverly Hills.

342
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:20,032
Then, a chicken sandwich
with the crust cut off.

343
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,971
Me, I get to do that. Some privilege, huh?

344
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,403
Anything else you could tell me
about Billie Williams?

345
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,843
What does she do all afternoon?

346
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:35,148
TV, else piano. Tinkles on the piano.
She used to be in show business.

347
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:40,179
Pictures all over the walls. Famous names.
"With love. To Billie."

348
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,687
Love? Who gets love?

349
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,589
Well, thank you.

350
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:51,891
You've really been a great help.
This is for your trouble.

351
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,378
$100!

352
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:03,967
No!

353
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,265
Thank you.

354
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:18,641
- Nobody home. I told you.
- I don't understand it. He's always on time.

355
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:22,210
He goofed! Your Superman goofed.

356
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:26,010
Remote control.

357
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:30,420
How did he know
she had remote control on the TV set?

358
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,217
Not even any wires.

359
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,219
He's supposed to know. He's Superman.

360
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:40,320
I have come to the conclusion, as follows.
Superman ain't quite right in the head.

361
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,491
Who's gonna hear me? You?

362
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:47,664
- I'm scared of him. He's unpredictable.
- I'm too mad to be scared.

363
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,104
Three days. Three little days.

364
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,201
Today's the 15th, tomorrow's the 16th,
the day after's the 17th...

365
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:58,908
He'll come through!
I got faith in that brain of his.

366
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:02,015
The trial starts the morning of the 18th.

367
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:03,849
If Billie Williams ever gets
to that witness stand...

368
00:37:03,921 --> 00:37:06,014
Don't even think about it.

369
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:10,451
- We should wire the Chief.
- No.

370
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:14,897
- One single reason why not.
- I don't trust Western Union.

371
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:19,127
- Then we'll call him direct.
- You'll get your head blown off direct.

372
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:24,038
I'd be better off. I wouldn't have this worry.
They sent a loony to do the job!

373
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:26,939
Wasn't his fault.

374
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:30,507
It was a good idea. A brilliant idea.

375
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:35,484
High-voltage electricity in a TV set,
she turns on the set, boom!

376
00:37:35,553 --> 00:37:36,611
It was very clever.

377
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:40,020
Clever, very clever. I admit it.
So clever which, it so happened,

378
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,149
it didn't work out!

379
00:37:41,225 --> 00:37:44,490
High-voltage electricity kills.
It killed Joe Dutch in 40 seconds.

380
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:47,292
Joe Dutch was strapped in a chair
by the State of New York.

381
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,230
- Same idea.
- The idea was a bust!

382
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,131
It wasn't his fault!

383
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:56,331
Look, boy, you and me,
we don't pretend to be supermen.

384
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,671
Me, I don't even claim to be Mighty Mouse.

385
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:02,076
But this, this is one job
I could do all by myself.

386
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:05,414
Foreign make. You can't trace it.

387
00:38:05,816 --> 00:38:09,843
Shoots soft bullets.
They spread when they hit. One shot kills.

388
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,013
You are not the contractor.

389
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:16,159
I'm willing to loan it to Claude.
Free of charge.

390
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,655
- You know he doesn't like guns.
- Who? Who likes guns?

391
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:23,689
I don't like guns.
Depends on which end you're talking about.

392
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:26,669
He has told you several times
he don't like guns.

393
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:30,764
- Superman! He can't stand the noise!
- Shut up! He might hear you.

394
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:34,434
He's not even here,
and you're scared of him?

395
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:38,738
I guess I am.

396
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,678
Which is it?

397
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:46,487
- Two loonies they send me.
- How did you get in?

398
00:38:46,557 --> 00:38:49,617
Skeleton key. Very handy.

399
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:53,290
Well, Superman?

400
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:58,631
Look, Claude, don't feel too bad.
It was a great idea.

401
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:03,604
I mean, how was you to know
the remote control?

402
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,370
They use it to eliminate commercials.
It's unfair.

403
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:11,079
Nobody knew. Did I know it?
Did you know it?

404
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:14,715
You and me, we're meatheads.
But he... He's Superman.

405
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:16,275
Shut up.

406
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,584
- Tomorrow's the 16th.
- I said shut up, please.

407
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:21,523
Sixteen plus two equals 18.

408
00:39:21,592 --> 00:39:25,790
You got 48 hours to finish the contract.
Forty-eight hours!

409
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:28,328
How you going to do it? Tell me how!

410
00:39:28,399 --> 00:39:30,867
Marc, Marc, leave him alone.
Can't you see he's trying to work it out?

411
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:33,267
I know that. He's got to.

412
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,271
After all, he's got that little house
on the Ohio River.

413
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,170
He's gotta get that out of escrow.
Am I right, Superman?

414
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:40,142
- Leave him alone, will you, Marc?
- Let him talk. Keep on talking, Marc.

415
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,941
Want a little advice? Will you listen?

416
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:47,981
I got no brains, that I know.
But one thing I got is an interest.

417
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,987
If this job isn't finished
to complete satisfaction, I got no future.

418
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:55,355
No future whatsoever.
So, if this job was entrusted to me...

419
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:58,418
- Marc, stop it.
- Go ahead. What would you do?

420
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:02,531
I would take a gun,
I would shoot my way into that house,

421
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,160
and finish the job once and for all.

422
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:09,002
Course, that don't take brains.
That just takes nerves and guts!

423
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,473
Which I don't believe you got!

424
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,974
You got no use for a gun?

425
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:27,419
They're illegal.
And I never use anything illegal.

426
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:30,388
I'm a law-abiding citizen.
I brush my teeth three times a day,

427
00:40:30,461 --> 00:40:33,453
and I never drive above local speed limits.

428
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:34,964
Funny.

429
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:38,024
Not that I don't appreciate
your thought, Marc. I do.

430
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:42,766
I watched that house for five hours today,
and things are bad. Very, very bad.

431
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,809
They've doubled, maybe tripled,
the guards around that place.

432
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:49,039
You can't get within 500 yards
without being searched and questioned.

433
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,308
And I was searched and questioned.

434
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:54,874
- You?
- Fortunately, I don't carry a weapon.

435
00:40:54,952 --> 00:41:00,254
I'm just a tourist, a dumb citizen, as you say.
And that's not the worst of it.

436
00:41:00,324 --> 00:41:03,987
That girl's scared.
She's so scared she won't go in the garden.

437
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:07,997
She just goes from the bed to the piano,
from the piano to the bed.

438
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:18,634
If I could only get her to come to the door
for a period of three seconds.

439
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:24,403
George, you're going
to drive me to a toy shop.

440
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:28,014
What? I hear right? Or am I going bats?

441
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:29,881
He said, "A toy shop."

442
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:32,889
- What?
- A toy shop.

443
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:38,557
He's gonna buy a cap pistol and bang, bang.
Scare her to death.

444
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:43,193
I like you, George. You got
a sense of humor. You're real clever.

445
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:45,997
That's the first signs of intelligence.

446
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,788
<i>- What do you think?</i>
<i>- I hold to my first opinion.</i>

447
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,620
<i>He's fresh-fried out of a nut factory.</i>

448
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:14,092
<i>Maybe he's crazy, but what's the difference?</i>
<i>He's still very clever.</i>

449
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:17,025
All right, now, straighten your right arm.

450
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:20,935
Get your left foot back about six inches
behind your right, at right angles.

451
00:42:21,005 --> 00:42:24,873
Now relax. Relax.
You can't hit anything unless you relax.

452
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:28,844
Look, Claude.
Clear up something for my stupid head first.

453
00:42:28,913 --> 00:42:31,814
How are you going to hit her
if she won't even come to the window?

454
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,908
Look, will you relax now?
You can't hit anything unless you relax.

455
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:36,850
Let it fly. Go ahead.

456
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:38,987
Pull back.

457
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:42,889
Well, here. Try another one.

458
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:46,889
Let's see how you do here.

459
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:49,198
Go ahead.

460
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:53,637
That's a little better.

461
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,739
Good. Very good.

462
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:33,709
Now, I want you to go in there
and take the steel tips off the arrows.

463
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:36,041
I don't want to hurt anybody.

464
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:05,028
- You didn't buy anything.
- Nope.

465
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:07,536
It's 5:00. It's getting late.

466
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:10,869
We can't do anything until tomorrow,
and tomorrow's the 17th!

467
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:15,071
- Well, what's your plan?
- How can I plan with all that noise going on?

468
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,639
- What noise?
- Your mouth.

469
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:26,312
Did you ever handle a gun, George?

470
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:28,816
I ain't talking.

471
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,392
How many men can a bullet kill?

472
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:36,496
One. Maybe two,
if they're standing close together.

473
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:39,661
- How about a hand grenade?
- Five, six.

474
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:44,203
Say a high-explosive shell,
a three-inch mortar?

475
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:48,111
- I don't know. I don't even want to know.
- Take a guess.

476
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:52,446
Well, maybe a dozen,
if they're standing close together.

477
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:56,282
How about a big navy gun?
Say a 6, 8, 11-inch?

478
00:45:57,187 --> 00:46:00,418
I don't know, but it's really gruesome.
I saw that English picture once...

479
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:02,516
How about an airplane bomb?

480
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:05,321
Hundred. Thousand.

481
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:07,056
Hydrogen bomb?

482
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:10,127
That's really murder. Maybe a million.

483
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:14,037
Fall on Los Angeles,
wipe out the whole smog.

484
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:18,598
And what do they do to the guy
that throws a grenade, fires a mortar shell,

485
00:46:18,675 --> 00:46:20,700
aims a navy gun, drops the airplane bomb,

486
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:24,179
or presses a button that sends a missile
5,000 miles with a hydrogen warhead?

487
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:27,513
- What do they do to him?
- You're talking about soldiers.

488
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:30,280
- Well, do they... Do they arrest them?
- No.

489
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:32,618
- Put them on trial?
- What for?

490
00:46:32,689 --> 00:46:36,250
Do they give them the gas chamber,
electrocute them or hang them?

491
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:40,562
- The soldier's doing his duty.
- And what if he refuses?

492
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:44,767
- Well, court-martial.
- They kill him for refusing to kill, right?

493
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:47,429
- Well, it's logical, isn't it?
- Look at this place.

494
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:50,530
Weapons for sale.
A warehouse full of murder.

495
00:46:50,607 --> 00:46:53,872
And me, because I've got
a business contract to kill one person,

496
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:56,742
they label me a goon, a murderer.

497
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,044
Funny, ironic, isn't it?

498
00:46:59,116 --> 00:47:02,643
I could go in there and pose
as a purchasing agent for a film company.

499
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:05,586
We have need for a genuine anti-tank gun
with live ammunition.

500
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,989
- That's great, Claude. That's great.
- It's got a range of 2,000 yards.

501
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:12,392
We could haul it up the hill
on a trailer hitch. Point it at the house.

502
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:15,192
Fire two or three rounds at the corner
of the house where she lives.

503
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:17,961
Wait a minute. Marc! Come here. Marc!

504
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,231
This boy's got it made.

505
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:24,797
A real genius, like I said.
Einstein's personal brain.

506
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:28,671
- All right, let's hear it.
- Go on, tell him, Claude.

507
00:47:28,745 --> 00:47:30,906
Marc, go in and get me
a Smith & Smith hunting rifle

508
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:33,449
with a tripod and telescopic sight.

509
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:37,647
Wait a minute. Claude, you said we were
going to get a genuine piece of artillery,

510
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:40,417
an anti-tank gun on caterpillar wheels.

511
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:43,459
Well, unfortunately, to get that weapon,
you have to have a license.

512
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,087
And to have a license,
you have to be a civilized country.

513
00:47:46,163 --> 00:47:48,825
- Now, are you a civilized country?
- Me?

514
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:51,832
I didn't even graduate third grade.

515
00:47:51,902 --> 00:47:55,099
All right, at least you're taking my advice.
You're getting a gun now.

516
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:57,504
How do you expect to hit the target
if you can't get the target

517
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:59,371
to come to the door?

518
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:03,379
I'm gonna let George take care
of that for me. Aren't you, George?

519
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,709
- How?
- With your little bow and arrow.

520
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,657
<i>Now, you don't know me,</i>
<i>but I saw your photo in the papers,</i>

521
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,162
<i>and I wondered if you and I
<i>couldn't get together for a little date.</i>

522
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,097
Sure, buddy,
where do you want me to pick you up?

523
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:28,194
- Who was it?
- Just a crank.

524
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:29,830
- Who are you?
- My name's Mayflower.

525
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,432
- James William Mayflower.
- I never saw you before.

526
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:34,602
I came on the night shift.
You were sleeping then.

527
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:38,978
- How do I know you're telling me the truth?
- Well, I have my badge here.

528
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,943
You can buy that badge in any drugstore.

529
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:44,351
Lady, I resent your attitude.

530
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:47,788
I had to take three examinations
for the privilege of buying this.

531
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:49,917
Now, you go back to sleep.
I'm here to protect you.

532
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:51,961
If I had wanted to kill you,
I could've done it hours ago.

533
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:56,693
I'm sorry, Officer. It's just that
I'm so scared sometimes I can't breathe!

534
00:48:56,767 --> 00:49:00,225
- They tried to kill me, do you know that?
- Well, I heard about it.

535
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:02,397
They blew up your television set,
didn't they?

536
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:03,598
Yes.

537
00:49:03,674 --> 00:49:04,732
Look, lady, if you're so afraid,

538
00:49:04,808 --> 00:49:06,503
why don't you request
they put you in custody?

539
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:07,804
What do you mean by that?

540
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:09,869
- Central jail, under lock and key.
- No!

541
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,142
Why not? You'd be safe there.

542
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:14,649
Why do you think
I'm going through all of this?

543
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:19,052
Why do you think I agreed to be a witness?
I want to keep out of jail.

544
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:21,824
You go back to sleep.
No one's going to hurt you.

545
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:25,055
In 24 hours, the trial will start,
and then it'll be all over.

546
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,789
All your troubles, believe me.

547
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:30,526
I believe you. I have to believe you.
What else can I do?

548
00:49:37,407 --> 00:49:41,673
Houseful of men staring at me.
Think they'd never seen a woman before.

549
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:48,241
Maybe they haven't. I want a woman in here.
You fired my maid. You fired my cook.

550
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,617
Two cops in the kitchen.
The meals taste like glue!

551
00:49:51,688 --> 00:49:54,782
I want decent meals!
And I want some service!

552
00:49:54,858 --> 00:50:00,421
I'm going to take that stand, not you.
It's my life I'm taking a chance on, not yours!

553
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,988
Now, I want a woman in here!
Do you hear me? A woman!

554
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:06,399
- Now, get on that phone!
- It won't do you no good.

555
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,734
Call up. Please tell them what I said.

556
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:25,054
Hi, honey. Listen, give me central division,
will you, please?

557
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:30,785
Sergeant? Sergeant, this is Mayflower.
I'm over here on the Williams beef.

558
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:33,222
Yeah.

559
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:38,833
Yeah, well, Miss Williams has a complaint.
She says she wants a woman in her room.

560
00:50:39,302 --> 00:50:41,270
I don't know, Sergeant,
she says men are too...

561
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:44,774
Sex crazy. That's what! Tell him "sex crazy"!

562
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:46,331
Sex crazy.

563
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:52,641
Sergeant. Listen,
she's been in here a long time.

564
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:55,945
She's nervous. That's all it is.

565
00:51:01,992 --> 00:51:06,190
- He says he'll send a maid over right away.
- Let's hope I live to see her.

566
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:09,756
Well, if you don't, I won't.

567
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:16,799
It can't work. It can't.
She'll never come to the door.

568
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:20,536
- You'll sit here forever.
- Maybe so. But I got one thing in my favor.

569
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,669
I'll be surprised. What?

570
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:25,947
The human female is
descended from the monkey,

571
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:28,780
and the monkey's
about the most curious animal in the world.

572
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:31,844
If anything goes on,
it just can't stand it not to know about it.

573
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:36,154
- Same thing with a woman.
- Not this dame. She's too scared.

574
00:51:36,226 --> 00:51:37,284
Yeah, with the top of her head.

575
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,590
But we're gonna get her
before she wakes up,

576
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:43,963
so she acts automatically, without thinking.
Wakes up and rushes right to that door.

577
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:46,764
And rushes right back. Great, Claude.

578
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:51,638
All I need is one and a half seconds.
Just enough time to squeeze the trigger.

579
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:55,506
I'm gonna zero in.

580
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:59,377
- You all set, George?
- Sure. Where do I aim?

581
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:04,213
- Over there into that brush, up in the hills.
- Wait a minute. Wait.

582
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:07,848
There's fuzz all over that hill.
They got shotguns every 50 yards.

583
00:52:07,924 --> 00:52:12,293
- The more, the better. Are you all set?
- How long do I wait?

584
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:15,631
You don't.
You go to work at exactly 8:00 a.m.

585
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:17,394
Suppose he goofs?

586
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:20,963
Well, then I just turn this gun around
and put a bullet in his head.

587
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:22,527
That I like.

588
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:27,835
- Some joke.
- I'm not joking.

589
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:32,509
- You mean it? You really mean it?
- You enjoy life, George?

590
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:37,110
- Times, yes, times, no.
- You like food, cigars, fat women?

591
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:41,624
- How do you know I favor fat women?
- I know about you, and I know about him.

592
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:45,252
I know about people.
I make a study of them. Psychology.

593
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:49,532
I like you, George, don't goof.
It would really hurt my feelings.

594
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:53,501
- What time?
- Same as Marc, exactly 8:00 a.m.

595
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:58,371
Just light enough to see and early enough
to wake her up for about 10 seconds.

596
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:15,213
- My name's Wexley.
- Are you the new maid?

597
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:17,647
- Bunco squad.
- Be careful.

598
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:20,417
If she knows you're not a maid,
she's gonna let out a scream.

599
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:23,459
I've heard the sound of female screams
quite a bit in my young life.

600
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:26,893
- Doesn't bother me anymore.
- What time have you got?

601
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:30,561
7:59 exactly.

602
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:32,693
Listen, be nice to her, will you,
even if it hurts?

603
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:36,705
She's got to get up on that stand tomorrow.
It's a nervous situation.

604
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:38,832
Well, she's all yours.

605
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:10,093
- You nervous, boy?
- No, but I like to make sure.

606
00:56:10,166 --> 00:56:13,226
I don't like collecting money
on false pretenses.

607
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:16,033
Where did you develop
such a big conscience?

608
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:18,267
I went to church regularly.

609
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:21,800
I don't like your jokes, Superman.

610
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:24,603
Well, George does. Don't you, George?

611
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:27,616
- I just spoke to Shingles.
- Wait a minute, you didn't tell him...

612
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:30,175
Don't have to tell him nothing.
He runs off at the mouth.

613
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:32,050
Well, come on, come on, what did he say?

614
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:35,057
He was told by a nurse who works
at the Georgia Street Receiving Hospital,

615
00:56:35,125 --> 00:56:36,888
who got it from a cop who was there.

616
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,292
What? What did he say?

617
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:43,093
When they wheeled out her body,
it was covered with a sheet.

618
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:47,364
- Maybe she was just wounded.
- Covered with a sheet, face and all.

619
00:56:49,172 --> 00:56:52,767
You see, Superman, a gun does a job.
A gun works.

620
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,845
You didn't want to use a gun.
You were afraid.

621
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:01,578
Hey, get your house out of escrow now.
What's the matter? You unhappy?

622
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:05,553
I should have stayed. I should have stayed
and checked the whole thing myself.

623
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:10,855
Look, Claude, I know Shingles.
He's a liar, but he wouldn't lie to me.

624
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:14,894
A cop tells a nurse, a nurse tells Shingles,
Shingles tells you.

625
00:57:15,298 --> 00:57:18,699
An awful lot of the facts
can get lost in a chain like that.

626
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:28,837
- Suppose he didn't hit the target.
- Don't even think about a thing like that.

627
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:42,248
"Billie Williams, former jazz pianist
and reputed ex-girlfriend of Big Smiley,

628
00:57:42,325 --> 00:57:47,854
"now under indictment for income tax fraud,
was shot to death early today in her home."

629
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:49,694
That's enough.
George, get those papers back.

630
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:52,166
Some poor citizen's looking for them.

631
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:54,396
As long as you're up, huh?

632
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:57,406
I don't believe it.

633
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,772
- What?
- Nothing.

634
00:58:01,744 --> 00:58:04,440
- Get me a train ticket, will you?
- There's plenty of time.

635
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:08,575
- The next train goes at 10:00.
- Well, that's five hours from now.

636
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,984
- What do I do for the next five hours?
- Relax, man.

637
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:15,925
How does a guy find relaxation
in this lousy town?

638
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:19,189
I can't believe it. I tell you,
I just can't believe it. That's all.

639
00:58:19,262 --> 00:58:21,526
What are you yapping about?

640
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:25,159
It's hard for me to believe
you turned out to be human.

641
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:28,328
Well, don't be too sure.

642
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:38,939
Immelman, Gross, Farber, and McGuire.
Mr. McGuire's office. Good afternoon.

643
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:42,978
Yes, Mrs. Clark.

644
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:47,655
Can do. I'll make a note of it.

645
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:51,958
Surely.

646
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,292
Surely.

647
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:03,767
But, Mrs. Clark, I wear indelible.

648
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:08,839
Well, I'll try.

649
00:59:11,781 --> 00:59:13,612
I'll do it for you.

650
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:20,015
Wipe your feet and come in.

651
00:59:20,356 --> 00:59:22,984
Hello. Hello.

652
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,089
It's little me.

653
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:29,097
Were you raised in a barn? Close the door.

654
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:42,439
My name's Mary.

655
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:45,777
Don't give me your life history, honey.
It'd break my heart.

656
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:49,345
I never discuss my personal affairs.

657
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:52,013
You will. Women always do.

658
00:59:52,522 --> 00:59:57,255
- Don't you like me?
- What's to like? I like you, yeah. Satisfied?

659
00:59:57,327 --> 01:00:00,558
No, you don't. Your tone is not sincere.

660
01:00:01,798 --> 01:00:05,325
You're disappointed. I'm truly sorry.

661
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:09,237
And I so wanted you
to have a good opinion of me.

662
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:13,071
I have no opinions whatsoever.
You can check in a half hour.

663
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:17,575
I like people to like me. Why don't you?

664
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:22,909
Well, I'll tell you why.
First place, take that lipstick off your mouth.

665
01:00:22,986 --> 01:00:27,218
Well, I have. I mean, I tried.
Look, nothing comes off. You see?

666
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,588
And in the second place,
you're two hours late.

667
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:31,593
I have to catch a train at 10:30.

668
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:33,526
Well, I work until 5:00.

669
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:37,430
Had to go home and change,
and I had a previous appointment.

670
01:00:38,534 --> 01:00:41,526
I had to bring a birthday present
to my mother's uncle.

671
01:00:41,604 --> 01:00:44,164
I don't care to hear about it.

672
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:48,609
- Where are we going for dinner?
- Any place you like, as long as it's quick.

673
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:52,281
You're not the politest person in the world.

674
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:56,844
Okay. I'll be polite. Have a drink.

675
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:59,821
- Drink? Well...
- Free of charge.

676
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:03,757
Guess a person can always use a drink.
You got a clean glass?

677
01:01:12,402 --> 01:01:15,565
There's one, all wrapped up.

678
01:01:17,473 --> 01:01:20,169
I like this hotel. It's nice.

679
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,374
Very sanitary and all that.

680
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:32,980
- You don't mind?
- No, just hurry up.

681
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:39,087
Don't get the wrong impression.
I'm not an alcoholic. I'm just nervous.

682
01:01:39,762 --> 01:01:42,925
All day long.
Ever since what happened this morning.

683
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:47,062
- There's been fuzz all over town.
- Why? What happened?

684
01:01:47,804 --> 01:01:50,500
Well, don't you read the local newspapers?

685
01:01:50,573 --> 01:01:53,565
You mean about the girl?
The girl piano player?

686
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:55,941
Yeah. Awful.

687
01:01:57,013 --> 01:02:00,141
She was the girlfriend
of one of the real biggies.

688
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,581
Is that so?

689
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:04,780
What a narrow escape. Makes me shudder.

690
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:08,921
You don't call being shot
and killed instantly

691
01:02:08,991 --> 01:02:10,891
a narrow escape, do you?

692
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,862
That's just what they gave out to the papers,
to avoid further trouble.

693
01:02:15,932 --> 01:02:21,564
Billie Williams wasn't hurt, just hysterical.
And I don't blame her one little bit.

694
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:25,838
They carried her out under a sheet.
I saw it on the front page.

695
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:27,876
That was a policewoman.

696
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:31,812
She made the mistake
of trying on Billie's negligee

697
01:02:31,881 --> 01:02:36,215
right in front of Billie's door.
Now, isn't that a howl?

698
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:41,551
And, you know,
when a member of the force gets killed,

699
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:43,285
well, they just go crazy.

700
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:47,352
I mean, they go all out,
and then everybody's in trouble.

701
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:52,627
They'll arrest a person
for just looking the wrong way.

702
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:55,533
- How do you know?
- They just do, that's all.

703
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:59,031
Well, they go crazy
when one of their own cops gets killed.

704
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:01,804
I mean, how do you know
the story in the paper was false?

705
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:02,867
I happen to know.

706
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:05,345
Look, you make a statement,
but you don't care to prove it.

707
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:07,382
Now, you made it up, didn't you? It's a lie?

708
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,681
- What difference does it make?
- It makes a lot of difference!

709
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:11,879
Why?

710
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:16,414
Look, I don't mean to get sore. I...

711
01:03:17,226 --> 01:03:20,218
I'm just curious, that's all. Have a drink.

712
01:03:25,034 --> 01:03:28,401
Well, my mother's uncle.

713
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:34,339
The one that had the birthday.
He's on the DA's staff.

714
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,844
High up. Very high up.

715
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:42,581
A nice, sweet old man. We see a lot of him.

716
01:03:44,053 --> 01:03:48,422
He told me. He said it like this.
He said, and I quote,

717
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:53,320
"Billie Williams is shot dead, true,

718
01:03:53,396 --> 01:03:57,799
"but she's nevertheless
going to appear very much alive

719
01:03:57,867 --> 01:04:02,031
"on the morning of the 18th
at 10:00 a.m. Exactly."

720
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:07,206
And that's what the man said.
And you implied I was a liar.

721
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:13,138
Miss, I'd like you to go home now.

722
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:18,750
- But what about dinner?
- I have to make a 10:30 train. Please.

723
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:27,228
All right. If I'm not wanted.

724
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:32,893
- No, I won't go. It's insulting!
- Get out! Here's your cab fare.

725
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:35,233
But why? I want to know why.

726
01:04:35,304 --> 01:04:39,104
I'm not in the mood.
Now, go on home like a good little girl.

727
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:43,835
All right, I'll go, but I won't be pushed.

728
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:50,148
Everybody pushes me around.
Everybody. Everybody!

729
01:04:51,587 --> 01:04:53,282
Look, I got nothing against you personally.

730
01:04:53,356 --> 01:04:57,349
It's just I developed a little headache,
and I've got to catch a train.

731
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:04,460
Look, don't be so emotional. It doesn't pay.
You've gotta look at life, dollars and cents,

732
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:06,660
cold, objective facts.

733
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:09,468
By which I mean face facts, little girl.
Business is business.

734
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:12,234
You've been paid, so come on. Go home.

735
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:19,107
You know, you're attractive.
I don't say that to everyone.

736
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:22,274
Please, don't think I'm the kind of girl
that says that to everyone.

737
01:05:22,351 --> 01:05:23,613
I don't.

738
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:26,983
I know. Lipstick.

739
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:32,554
I'll leave you my office phone,
and next time you're in town, you call me.

740
01:05:32,628 --> 01:05:33,856
All right, I'll do that.

741
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,797
- Now, remember, you promised.
- I won't forget, sweetheart.

742
01:05:36,866 --> 01:05:38,891
- You call me.
- Bye-bye.

743
01:05:42,805 --> 01:05:44,670
Hey, you're up early.

744
01:05:45,908 --> 01:05:48,468
- Where are you going, Claude?
- Home.

745
01:05:48,978 --> 01:05:51,913
You're upset. Naturally, we're all upset.

746
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:55,414
But you can't leave now. It's not fair to us.

747
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:57,452
I tried. I tried twice.

748
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:01,712
I don't mind telling you, Claude.
You disappoint me.

749
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:06,090
- It can't be done. The contract's a jinx.
- Jinx?

750
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:10,728
If you don't complete this job,
you're the one who's jinxed.

751
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,768
And we're jinxed right along with you.

752
01:06:12,835 --> 01:06:15,736
You can't force me to work against a jinx.
If I do, I'm dead.

753
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,670
Who's gonna force you?

754
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:22,040
But if you don't fulfill your part
of the contract, we're...

755
01:06:22,111 --> 01:06:23,169
What were you saying, George?

756
01:06:23,245 --> 01:06:26,476
Nothing. He wasn't saying nothing.
He's disappointed, that's all.

757
01:06:26,549 --> 01:06:28,210
What do you mean?

758
01:06:28,284 --> 01:06:32,744
- Like he said, I'm disappointed.
- Sure, because Claude's right, George.

759
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:36,656
You can't work against a jinx.
Hey, what time does your train leave?

760
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:40,756
- Well, I could get the 7:42. It's a coach.
- Well, you don't have much time.

761
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:41,956
We'll drive you down to Union Station.

762
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:45,398
- No, don't bother. I'll take a cab.
- No, no, we'll drive you.

763
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:48,528
We wouldn't want the Chief
to think that we goofed on our job.

764
01:06:48,604 --> 01:06:50,902
Come on, George, get his bag.

765
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:17,289
Union Station?

766
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:43,249
Look, Claude, we felt it would be better

767
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:47,318
if we kind of hid you away
for a couple, three days, you know.

768
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:50,160
Well, the Chief's gonna be pretty sore.

769
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:55,566
He's already sore.

770
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:58,106
- How do you know?
- We spoke to him.

771
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:00,965
- How?
- On the phone.

772
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:05,508
- What did he say?
- He said to get rid.

773
01:08:06,816 --> 01:08:08,408
- Of me?
- Of you.

774
01:08:08,818 --> 01:08:10,877
Unless you changed your mind
and finished the job.

775
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:14,980
- What? He didn't say...
- I say! Let him finish the job.

776
01:08:15,057 --> 01:08:18,254
No. No chance.

777
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:20,659
Look, Claude, I...

778
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:24,698
Look, I won't work against the jinx,
and that's it.

779
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:28,760
All right. It's settled.
Come on, we'll show you to your room.

780
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:33,931
- What is this place?
- It's a movie studio.

781
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,510
Not much business.

782
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:16,250
- He's sick.
- Stay where you are.

783
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:25,258
Superman.

784
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:33,096
Get up, Superman!

785
01:09:56,992 --> 01:10:00,723
Guns are bad luck, Marc.
You better take this with you.

786
01:10:00,796 --> 01:10:03,594
Where you're going, kid, you'll need it.

787
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:11,266
George! George!

788
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:16,102
I'm your pal, George! I need you.
We'll do it together!

789
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:18,911
We'll finish this contract, George!
You and me!

790
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:22,108
Tell Mr. Brink to get back from Europe.

791
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:26,705
Tell him to call me right back.
If he doesn't, I'll fill my contract with him.

792
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:29,482
<i>Would you give your number, sir, please?</i>

793
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:33,920
Beachwood 7-4400. Room 505.

794
01:12:02,284 --> 01:12:04,218
- Hello?
<i>- Who's this?</i>

795
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:06,612
This is Claude.

796
01:12:07,222 --> 01:12:10,521
- I said, this is Claude!
<i>- What do you want?</i>

797
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:15,293
- Why didn't you tell me it was a woman?
<i>- So what?</i>

798
01:12:15,364 --> 01:12:18,765
Well, a woman will cost you more money.
Ten grand.

799
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:23,167
- Wire me 10 grand care of Western Union.
<i>- Ten grand?</i>

800
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:26,571
That's right. One followed by four zeros.

801
01:12:27,543 --> 01:12:30,842
<i>- I'll send it care of the boys.</i>
- The boys are dead.

802
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,992
- Nice little house.
- Yeah, it is.

803
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:27,126
You buying it or selling it?

804
01:13:27,202 --> 01:13:30,330
No, I've been hired to
do the landscaping on it.

805
01:13:30,939 --> 01:13:33,601
Any questions, I'd be glad to assist.

806
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:37,041
Yeah, what are these squares
outside the house here?

807
01:13:37,112 --> 01:13:39,910
Drains. Holes with steel grating.

808
01:13:40,849 --> 01:13:44,182
- What are they for?
- Drainage. Rainwater.

809
01:13:44,953 --> 01:13:49,287
It doesn't rain much in Los Angeles,
but when it does, boy, watch out.

810
01:13:49,691 --> 01:13:51,921
- You from out of town?
- Yeah.

811
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:55,952
Me, I am native-born, like the gophers. Joke.

812
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:58,596
What are these parallel lines here?

813
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:01,659
Nothing to worry about.
They belong to the county.

814
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:05,298
- Culvert, a big pipe to carry off the water.
- How big?

815
01:14:06,308 --> 01:14:08,970
Two feet. About big enough for a man.

816
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:18,012
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- You bet. Pay the cashier on your way out.

817
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:42,192
- Who are you?
- I'm the relief officer. I'm new.

818
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:44,391
Never seen you before.

819
01:16:44,466 --> 01:16:47,333
Does music bug you
like it does all the other cops?

820
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:49,563
If you want to play, play.

821
01:17:12,327 --> 01:17:15,194
Stop walking around.
You're making me nervous.

822
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:18,255
If I sit, I get nervous. How long is that piece?

823
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:21,461
You'll see when I finish it.

824
01:17:21,536 --> 01:17:24,266
Why do you want to testify against Brink?

825
01:17:24,339 --> 01:17:26,899
That's a funny question for a cop to ask.

826
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:29,068
Even a cop would hesitate to
do what you're doing.

827
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:32,375
It's Brink or me! Once he's gone, I'll be safe.

828
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:49,056
Turn around. Keep playing.

829
01:17:49,798 --> 01:17:51,356
Keep playing!

830
01:18:40,482 --> 01:18:43,508
You'll never get away with it.
Even if you kill me.

831
01:18:43,585 --> 01:18:45,075
They'll get you before you get out of here.

832
01:18:48,757 --> 01:18:52,352
That's the relief.
Give me a break, and I'll give you one.

833
01:18:52,427 --> 01:18:54,224
Get out of here, and I won't scream.

834
01:19:13,815 --> 01:19:16,648
You, down there! You don't have a chance!

835
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:20,180
Come on out! We'll give you a break!
