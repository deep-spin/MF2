1
00:01:11,752 --> 00:01:14,710
What part did you play in the
recent local elections, Mr. Rienzi?

2
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:17,821
You got me mixed up
with somebody else, senator.

3
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:19,976
I'm in the cement
and contracting business.

4
00:01:20,096 --> 00:01:22,072
What would you say your
earnings are per year?

5
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:24,441
Around 20,000 or 30,000.

6
00:01:24,516 --> 00:01:27,940
Say 30,000. You've got
a $60,000 home here.

7
00:01:28,007 --> 00:01:31,295
A winter place in Miami.
A summer place in Maine.

8
00:01:31,367 --> 00:01:34,245
Two limousines. A sailboat worth 50,000.

9
00:01:34,313 --> 00:01:38,409
All on $30,000 a year. How
do you do it, Mr. Rienzi?

10
00:01:38,476 --> 00:01:41,445
Sometimes I wonder myself, senator.

11
00:01:43,566 --> 00:01:45,989
It was testified here
yesterday that you were paid...

12
00:01:46,014 --> 00:01:49,302
$200,000 in cash to, uh,
influence the election.

13
00:01:49,702 --> 00:01:51,742
Yeah, I read that
in the papers.

14
00:01:52,218 --> 00:01:54,766
Now, if somebody'll only tell me
where all that money is hiding.

15
00:01:54,836 --> 00:01:57,646
- You deny meddling in the election?
- Does it look like it?

16
00:01:57,717 --> 00:02:00,561
After all, you got elected,
didn't you, senator?

17
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:21,433
Fire swept through
upper floors of hospital...

18
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,848
You say this man keeps
getting undressed...

19
00:02:24,872 --> 00:02:26,783
without pulling down
the shades?

20
00:02:26,808 --> 00:02:28,719
Well, what's your complaint,
madam? Boy!

21
00:02:28,908 --> 00:02:30,808
Here.

22
00:02:33,902 --> 00:02:37,247
Well, from the condition of the body, she'd
been soaking in the river for several days.

23
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,096
This fur coat she wore
was all she had on.

24
00:02:39,128 --> 00:02:41,282
Well, maybe she was
a rich society matron.

25
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:43,990
Mink isn't class-Conscious,
Sonny. No.

26
00:02:44,267 --> 00:02:46,212
No other clothes,
no identification-

27
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:49,356
Mr. Hutcheson wants to
see you in his office, sir.

28
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:51,383
Boy!

29
00:02:58,009 --> 00:02:59,783
What about the Rienzi
story, George?

30
00:02:59,857 --> 00:03:01,905
Boss wants
to check it first.

31
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,795
One column head
three line bank.

32
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,949
A.P. Says the paper's
being sold.

33
00:03:26,015 --> 00:03:27,482
- What?
- Sold?

34
00:03:27,506 --> 00:03:28,631
Who to? When?

35
00:03:28,705 --> 00:03:30,034
What about that, Frank?

36
00:03:30,058 --> 00:03:31,672
That's something
only the Garrison heirs,

37
00:03:31,697 --> 00:03:33,616
Hutcheson and the gods
would know, not us.

38
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:37,451
It's a conspiracy to keep you
just as you are, nice and ignorant.

39
00:03:37,476 --> 00:03:39,706
Sold.
I can't believe it.

40
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:41,631
Don't believe the Associated Press?

41
00:03:41,798 --> 00:03:44,608
- My, my.
- Maine 2000.

42
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,596
Better run for your lives, men.

43
00:03:46,665 --> 00:03:49,088
And don't forget to trample
the women, loudmouth.

44
00:03:49,163 --> 00:03:51,779
Record? Give me the city desk.

45
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:54,666
Look, who's the boss?
Who says what goes in the paper?

46
00:03:54,691 --> 00:03:57,398
- The managing editor, Mr. Hutcheson.
- Then he's the man I want to see.

47
00:03:57,423 --> 00:04:00,324
Well, right now, he's busier than
a bird dog. Why don't you sit down?

48
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:01,827
If you don't mind.

49
00:04:02,102 --> 00:04:04,684
- He's still in a makeup conference.
- Call him, call him.

50
00:04:05,074 --> 00:04:07,781
Credit controls. Inflation
to be halted. Billions.

51
00:04:08,059 --> 00:04:09,783
- Yes?
- Frank Allen, urgent.

52
00:04:09,808 --> 00:04:12,572
Okay. Billions required.

53
00:04:12,596 --> 00:04:17,329
National budget.
O.P.S., N.A.M., P.C.A.

54
00:04:17,438 --> 00:04:20,111
What's all this mean
to the reader?

55
00:04:20,184 --> 00:04:22,709
- Consumption tax, eh?
- Sounds like a disease.

56
00:04:22,818 --> 00:04:25,548
It'll be page one in every paper
in the country. In The Day too.

57
00:04:25,572 --> 00:04:28,052
What does this tax program mean
to the average man and woman?

58
00:04:28,077 --> 00:04:30,989
Not billions, that's an impossible
figure. Here, break it down.

59
00:04:31,142 --> 00:04:33,531
Yes, sir. What'll it cost
the housewife for groceries?

60
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:36,901
How much more for a car? A radio?
Fifty bucks? A hundred? How much?

61
00:04:36,926 --> 00:04:39,573
Run the story as is, page one.
New lead for the second edition.

62
00:04:39,598 --> 00:04:41,006
Right.

63
00:04:42,114 --> 00:04:44,663
United Press flood story
in same slot?

64
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:47,488
- Pictures come in yet?
- With casualty lists.

65
00:04:47,557 --> 00:04:48,538
- All right.
- Yes, Frank.

66
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:49,562
Ed...

67
00:04:53,633 --> 00:04:55,726
What about the dead nude murder story?

68
00:04:56,043 --> 00:04:57,779
- Is it murder?
- Looks like it.

69
00:04:57,804 --> 00:05:00,648
Looks like it! Who is she?

70
00:05:00,948 --> 00:05:03,462
I don't know yet. Got some
pictures of her though.

71
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:05,444
Very interesting.

72
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:09,118
Put 'em on postcards
and send 'em to Paris.

73
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:11,600
Second section. Play it
down. No pictures. Yes, sir.

74
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:14,115
Story's fine, George.
Tie it off.

75
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:16,411
Yes?

76
00:05:16,436 --> 00:05:19,052
- You're late for the dome.
- Ok.

77
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:21,428
Can you leave tonight to
handle that strike upstate?

78
00:05:21,481 --> 00:05:23,298
Oh, I'd like to stay
with the Rienzi story.

79
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,037
- You're wasting your time, baby.
- Not if we can prove he's guilty.

80
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:28,019
It's not our job
to prove he's guilty.

81
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,414
We're not detectives, and we're
not in the crusading business.

82
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,777
- Give me a week.
- Forget it, State Senate couldn't prove anything.

83
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,627
Neither could that probe
four years ago.

84
00:05:35,652 --> 00:05:38,928
We've had a nice circus, that's
all. Television's had a field day,

85
00:05:38,953 --> 00:05:41,321
All the papers
raised their circulation,

86
00:05:41,427 --> 00:05:43,315
And Rienzi's lawyers got richer.

87
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,099
One week. Three days.
Please, I got a good lead.

88
00:05:49,155 --> 00:05:52,386
All right. Stay out of trouble.

89
00:05:54,429 --> 00:05:55,789
Ed.

90
00:05:56,284 --> 00:05:59,026
That's right, Frank.
Baby's on the auction block.

91
00:05:59,495 --> 00:06:02,432
But we're the best outfit in town,
in the country maybe.

92
00:06:02,705 --> 00:06:04,430
- But why, why sell?
- Money.

93
00:06:04,455 --> 00:06:07,868
That's usually the reason
something is sold, isn't it?

94
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,808
Tell 'em I'm on my way up.

95
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:12,631
The heirs and the lawyers are
up in the dome right now...

96
00:06:12,655 --> 00:06:15,931
waiting to explain the nature of
their crime with facts, figures...

97
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:17,663
and falsehoods.

98
00:06:17,873 --> 00:06:20,262
One more "f" and they won't be drafted.

99
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:24,617
But, mother,
the paper belongs to us.

100
00:06:24,731 --> 00:06:26,665
Why do we have to go
to court to sell it?

101
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,135
Perhaps because we never
intended it to be sold.

102
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:32,016
Oh, please, mother. We've
been over that a hundred times.

103
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,100
The surrogates court will
decide that, Mrs. Garrison.

104
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,492
- Ed.
- Mrs. Garrison.

105
00:06:35,517 --> 00:06:36,882
What kept you so long?

106
00:06:36,907 --> 00:06:39,282
- How is the expectant mother?
- Lousy.

107
00:06:39,618 --> 00:06:41,137
- Hello, Ed.
- Alice.

108
00:06:41,162 --> 00:06:43,348
- You're looking very well.
- Thank you. How's your husband?

109
00:06:43,512 --> 00:06:46,060
- Oh fine, just fine.
- It's fine, isn't it?

110
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:49,639
Let's get this over with. I suppose
you know why we're here, Mr. Hutcheson.

111
00:06:49,663 --> 00:06:52,428
Practically everybody seems to know
except the people who work here.

112
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,045
We're sorry about that.

113
00:06:54,069 --> 00:06:56,628
We thought it best to make a
general announcement discretely.

114
00:06:56,653 --> 00:06:59,178
The death of a newspaper
is never discreet.

115
00:06:59,568 --> 00:07:01,661
Here we go again.

116
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:04,192
The last will and testament
of the late John Garrison,

117
00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:06,658
Drawn up just prior to
his death 11 years ago,

118
00:07:06,682 --> 00:07:09,794
Designated as his heirs
his eldest daughter Alice,

119
00:07:10,325 --> 00:07:13,669
His daughter Katherine
and his wife Margaret.

120
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:16,388
Inasmuch as Katherine attained
her majority last week...

121
00:07:16,413 --> 00:07:18,381
and became entitled
to a full vote,

122
00:07:18,406 --> 00:07:20,692
- It was decided by the three stockholders...
- Decided?

123
00:07:20,993 --> 00:07:23,871
- Unanimously?
- Of course.

124
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:26,557
Uh, any objections?

125
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,846
Would it make
any difference?

126
00:07:28,913 --> 00:07:32,394
- None.
- Then I have no objections.

127
00:07:32,508 --> 00:07:35,466
- The reason it was decided...
- Must we go into detail?

128
00:07:35,491 --> 00:07:37,459
I don't feel well.

129
00:07:37,531 --> 00:07:39,840
My entire staff
feels the same way.

130
00:07:39,864 --> 00:07:43,061
Oh, Ed. What do Alice or
I know about newspapers?

131
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:44,858
Gives you an income.

132
00:07:44,883 --> 00:07:47,599
We never even come down here
except twice a year for meetings.

133
00:07:47,624 --> 00:07:49,081
You're invited
every day.

134
00:07:49,297 --> 00:07:52,619
Mrs. Courtney's husband feels the money
could be invested more wisely elsewhere.

135
00:07:52,644 --> 00:07:56,230
John Garrison founded this paper,
not Mrs. Courtney's husband.

136
00:07:56,254 --> 00:07:57,761
- We're taking care of you, Ed.
- What?

137
00:07:57,906 --> 00:07:59,308
We always try anyhow.

138
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,981
You're to get one
percent of the sale price.

139
00:08:01,006 --> 00:08:04,225
Your share will amount to slightly
more than $50,000. Thank you.

140
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:07,371
You're to notify all personnel
they will receive two weeks' pay.

141
00:08:07,396 --> 00:08:10,320
- In the meantime
- Wait a minute, this sounds as if we're being closed down.

142
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,727
Who's buying The Day? What
difference can it make?

143
00:08:12,751 --> 00:08:15,493
To the 1500 people who work for
you, it makes a lot of difference.

144
00:08:16,047 --> 00:08:17,819
Well, who is buying it?

145
00:08:18,383 --> 00:08:20,216
Or are you ashamed of it?

146
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,459
Lawrence white
is the buyer.

147
00:08:24,716 --> 00:08:27,594
White? We're being sold to The Standard.

148
00:08:27,702 --> 00:08:29,954
Oh, I think
I'm going to vomit.

149
00:08:30,505 --> 00:08:31,972
So do I.

150
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,725
Mr. White's paper
is very successful.

151
00:08:33,749 --> 00:08:35,712
He will undoubtedly make
this one more profitable too.

152
00:08:35,736 --> 00:08:38,291
It won't be this paper anymore.
It'll be lost in The Standard.

153
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,585
As far as we're concerned,
his offer is a generous one.

154
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:44,225
He's only buying our circulation,
features and goodwill.

155
00:08:44,438 --> 00:08:47,601
He's eliminating his
competition, that's all.

156
00:08:47,712 --> 00:08:49,952
Mrs. Garrison, you've got to stop them.

157
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:53,579
Your husband created a new kind
of journalism, and you helped him.

158
00:08:53,914 --> 00:08:56,439
Take a look at the first
paper you ever printed.

159
00:08:56,795 --> 00:09:00,052
Here. Page one.
Quote:

160
00:09:00,124 --> 00:09:02,777
"This paper will fight
for progress and reform.

161
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:05,319
"We'll never be satisfied
merely with printing the news.

162
00:09:05,568 --> 00:09:07,616
"We'll never be afraid
to attack wrong,

163
00:09:07,641 --> 00:09:10,895
Whether by predatory wealth
or predatory poverty.”

164
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,820
You're not selling
The Day, you're killing it.

165
00:09:13,338 --> 00:09:15,187
The hearing to approve
the sale will take place...

166
00:09:15,212 --> 00:09:16,800
in surrogates court
day after tomorrow.

167
00:09:16,825 --> 00:09:19,919
- You'll be there, of course.
- I never go to funerals.

168
00:09:22,377 --> 00:09:25,153
I think I like that man.

169
00:09:25,225 --> 00:09:27,398
Too excitable, much.

170
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:30,594
It might be advisable to replace
him until the sale is consummated.

171
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,114
Oh, shut up.
Please.

172
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,908
Stop it! Stop it!

173
00:09:37,115 --> 00:09:40,843
Come on. Get him, Frank.

174
00:09:43,603 --> 00:09:46,925
Kill him, Frank. Kill him.

175
00:09:48,603 --> 00:09:50,514
Hey, cut it out.

176
00:09:54,981 --> 00:09:57,176
You all right?
In the pink.

177
00:09:57,473 --> 00:10:00,463
Yeah.
What happened?

178
00:10:00,563 --> 00:10:04,750
One punch, six pushes, two kicks,
lots of hollerin', no decision.

179
00:10:04,953 --> 00:10:07,534
Henry? Well, I was settin'
there, minding my own business-

180
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:09,384
He's been asking for it.
Heard the rumor.

181
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,675
Quit without notice.
Took a job at the record.

182
00:10:12,142 --> 00:10:13,979
The rumor? Well, how
about it, Mr. Hutcheson?

183
00:10:14,048 --> 00:10:18,041
Is it a rumor? We have a right
to protect ourselves, haven't we?

184
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:20,307
Well, go ahead.

185
00:10:20,352 --> 00:10:22,229
Tell us we got
nothing to worry about.

186
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:29,987
The day after tomorrow
in surrogates court...

187
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:34,686
You got two weeks' pay coming
to ya. The paper's closing.

188
00:10:35,109 --> 00:10:37,377
Quit now and look
for another job or...

189
00:10:37,478 --> 00:10:39,570
wait for the probate
judge's decision.

190
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:40,748
It's up to you.

191
00:10:42,094 --> 00:10:46,225
It was nothing personal, Mr. Hutcheson.
I have my family to think about.

192
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,514
That's right, Henry.
Nothing personal.

193
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:53,349
- Oh, Mr. Hutcheson, the mayor wants...
- I'm busy.

194
00:10:55,131 --> 00:10:57,554
- What are you going to do?
- I got an assignment.

195
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:01,219
- Harry?
- There's still a sports page to get out.

196
00:11:16,432 --> 00:11:20,208
- Fighting, a man your age.
- Did me good.

197
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:23,034
- He was right to quit, they all ought to quit.
- Maybe.

198
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:25,507
Anyway, I got it
out of my system.

199
00:11:25,771 --> 00:11:28,126
You were with the new
york world, weren't you?

200
00:11:28,196 --> 00:11:30,876
Under Pulitzer,
Cobb and Barrett.

201
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:33,908
- What you do when it folded?
- Let's see now.

202
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,622
I think I got myself a
drink. Yep, I'm sure of it.

203
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,272
Then what'd you do?

204
00:11:39,296 --> 00:11:41,538
Came over here and went
to work for old man Garrison.

205
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:43,656
He was a great
newspaperman.

206
00:11:43,724 --> 00:11:46,870
Yeah, but no good
as a father. Terrible.

207
00:11:47,003 --> 00:11:50,334
Daughters, one of 'em married
to a high-Class broker...

208
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:52,839
who knows how to invest
their money more wisely.

209
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,871
They hate the paper, same
as they hated the old man.

210
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:59,723
Couldn't get at him when he was alive, so
now they're kickin' him when he's dead. Yes?

211
00:11:59,794 --> 00:12:03,059
- Five minutes to press time.
- Ok, come in.

212
00:12:03,124 --> 00:12:06,639
Everybody in this racket gets kicked
sooner or later, dead or alive.

213
00:12:06,751 --> 00:12:08,386
- Get that in the fudge box.
- Yes, sir.

214
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:10,344
- The mayor...
- Darn the mayor.

215
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:12,421
Yes, sir.

216
00:12:14,586 --> 00:12:16,178
The mayor.

217
00:12:16,398 --> 00:12:19,822
All he cares about is who'll support
him for reelection if we fold.

218
00:12:19,847 --> 00:12:23,647
By now, the boys will be having a nice
lively wake at O'Brien's. Ever been to one?

219
00:12:23,966 --> 00:12:27,641
Before you know it, lad, you won't be
feeling a thing, not a blessed thing.

220
00:12:27,751 --> 00:12:30,072
That's what a wake Is for.

221
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,578
Yes, that's right.

222
00:12:44,688 --> 00:12:48,135
Brothers and sisters,
hush up for a minute.

223
00:12:48,241 --> 00:12:51,866
- Friends and now unemployed...
- Hear, hear. Lend me your ears.

224
00:12:51,891 --> 00:12:54,735
- We're gathered here to bury Caesar.
- No.

225
00:12:55,187 --> 00:12:59,780
Brothers and sisters, we came
to praise The Day, not bury it.

226
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,839
- I got the urge, brother. I got the urge.
- Repent and rejoice.

227
00:13:05,906 --> 00:13:08,943
Brother Cleary, a sinner
of 14 years standing,

228
00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:14,354
Sitting or lying down, will
let out the misery. Hallelujah!

229
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:16,268
Maestro, uh, "b" flat,
if you please.

230
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:19,683
Flash! Scoop-Scoop. Da-Dee-Deep,
dee-Dee, dee-Dee, dee-Dee-Deep.

231
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,854
I came over the river Jordan
from a weekly scandal sheet...

232
00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:25,133
and asked old John Garrison for a job.

233
00:13:25,307 --> 00:13:27,848
"Are you a journalist
or a reporter?" He said.

234
00:13:27,902 --> 00:13:29,724
"What's the difference?"
I said.

235
00:13:29,828 --> 00:13:31,774
"A journalist makes himself
the hero of the story.

236
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:36,680
A reporter is only the witness."”

237
00:13:36,913 --> 00:13:38,892
Sister Barndollar.

238
00:13:38,917 --> 00:13:42,808
Sister Barndollar, has the spirit
moved the research department?

239
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:47,433
Ah. The spirits moved her, all right.

240
00:13:47,503 --> 00:13:49,539
Hallelujah and pass
the collection box.

241
00:13:49,648 --> 00:13:51,308
- Sister Willebrandt.
- Cheers.

242
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:55,083
Comin' through the rye, present
and, uh, half accounted for.

243
00:13:55,108 --> 00:13:57,019
Hey!

244
00:13:57,299 --> 00:13:59,972
Hey, hey, hey! Come on,
honey. Give us a soul talk.

245
00:14:00,044 --> 00:14:02,148
It's a lovely corpse.

246
00:14:02,253 --> 00:14:05,587
Alas, poor dear.
I knew it well.

247
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:10,600
And why not? I gave it the
best 14 years of my life.

248
00:14:10,707 --> 00:14:12,777
And what have I got
to show for it, huh?

249
00:14:13,044 --> 00:14:17,287
Eighty-One dollars in the
bank, two dead husbands...

250
00:14:18,164 --> 00:14:22,852
and two or three kids I
always wanted but never had.

251
00:14:23,138 --> 00:14:25,268
I've covered everything
from electrocutions...

252
00:14:25,293 --> 00:14:27,118
to love nest brawls.

253
00:14:27,143 --> 00:14:31,045
I've got fallen arches, unfixed teeth,
and you wanna know something, I...

254
00:14:31,612 --> 00:14:34,488
I never saw Paris, but-

255
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,453
But I wouldn't change
those years.

256
00:14:38,121 --> 00:14:41,214
Not for anything
in this world.

257
00:14:45,365 --> 00:14:48,201
- I see the light, brother.
- Hallelujah!

258
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:50,601
Purify your soul, sinner.

259
00:14:50,626 --> 00:14:53,186
Save your tears.
This is what the readers want.

260
00:14:53,211 --> 00:14:55,702
- No.
- Throw the atheist out.

261
00:14:55,768 --> 00:14:58,612
Don't sell it short. It's
got twice our circulation...

262
00:14:58,637 --> 00:15:01,424
and three times
our advertising lineage.

263
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:08,132
It's wild and yellow, but
it's not exactly a newspaper.

264
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:12,470
- It keeps its people working.
- Hallelujah.

265
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:16,101
Well, maybe if I'd given you this
kind of paper, you'd still have jobs.

266
00:15:16,256 --> 00:15:19,134
- There's a place for this kind of sheet.
- Where, daddy?

267
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,344
All right, so it's not
your kind of paper.

268
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,418
Who are we puttin' out
papers for? You?

269
00:15:23,533 --> 00:15:25,639
You? You?
Huh.

270
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,499
It's not enough anymore
to give 'em just news.

271
00:15:28,676 --> 00:15:31,520
They want comics,
contests, puzzles.

272
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,884
They want to know how to bake a cake,
win friends and influence the future.

273
00:15:34,992 --> 00:15:37,825
Ergo, horoscopes,
tips on the horses,

274
00:15:37,897 --> 00:15:41,321
Interpretation of dreams so they
can win on the numbers lotteries.

275
00:15:41,492 --> 00:15:45,735
And, if they accidentally
stumble on the first page,

276
00:15:45,804 --> 00:15:47,749
News.

277
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:51,332
<i>Old man Garrison lies
a moldering in the grave</i>

278
00:15:51,407 --> 00:15:55,343
Old man Garrison lies
a Moldering in the grave

279
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,873
<i>Old man Garrison lies
a moldering in the grave</i>

280
00:15:57,979 --> 00:16:00,937
you know, I never got to Paris either.

281
00:16:01,052 --> 00:16:03,085
Have some anesthetic, brother.

282
00:16:03,251 --> 00:16:14,924
Glory, glory, hallelujah

283
00:16:15,386 --> 00:16:19,959
his day is done and gone

284
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,358
Feeling any pain, ed?

285
00:16:39,662 --> 00:16:41,892
Ah, it was a nice wake.

286
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,843
Good night.

287
00:16:52,373 --> 00:16:54,819
Mr. Hutcheson?

288
00:16:54,895 --> 00:16:57,898
I've been trying
to see you all day, sir.

289
00:16:57,968 --> 00:17:00,459
They said
I'd find you here and-

290
00:17:00,569 --> 00:17:04,426
This will introduce me, sir. It's from
my journalism professor at the university.

291
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:08,396
Oh, so you want to be
a newspaperman.

292
00:17:08,509 --> 00:17:11,239
Yes, sir. One student a
semester is recommended.

293
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:13,263
- And you're it.
- Yes, sir.

294
00:17:13,335 --> 00:17:16,532
Newspaperman is the best
profession in the world.

295
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:18,643
You know
what a profession is?

296
00:17:18,753 --> 00:17:24,180
- It's a skilled job.
- Yeah, so is repairing watches. No.

297
00:17:24,292 --> 00:17:27,671
A profession is a
performance for public good.

298
00:17:27,782 --> 00:17:30,364
That's why newspaper
work is a profession.

299
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:33,338
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

300
00:17:33,408 --> 00:17:36,343
I, uh, I suppose you want to be a columnist.

301
00:17:36,417 --> 00:17:38,521
Foreign correspondent.
To Egypt.

302
00:17:38,596 --> 00:17:41,048
- Do you speak Arabic?
- No, sir, but...

303
00:17:41,453 --> 00:17:44,286
But you do know the
customs, habits, religion,

304
00:17:44,358 --> 00:17:48,177
Superstitions of the people. Well, I
took a course in near eastern relations-

305
00:17:48,202 --> 00:17:51,726
You know the psychology of Egyptian
politics and Muslim diplomacy?

306
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:56,414
No, sir. - Expert on economy,
topography and geography of Egypt?

307
00:17:56,531 --> 00:17:59,255
I speak a little french.
Maybe I could get a job in the-

308
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,910
Yeah, so do I, but I couldn't hold
down a job in my own Paris office.

309
00:18:04,112 --> 00:18:06,569
I see.

310
00:18:08,728 --> 00:18:11,037
Hey, Joe.

311
00:18:14,355 --> 00:18:16,636
So, you want to be
a reporter?

312
00:18:17,123 --> 00:18:20,024
Here's some advice
about this racket.

313
00:18:20,525 --> 00:18:23,904
Don't ever change your mind. It
may not be the oldest profession,

314
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:25,774
But it's the best.

315
00:18:25,849 --> 00:18:27,828
Yes, sir.

316
00:18:49,893 --> 00:18:51,804
Hi.

317
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,301
Why don't you
go home, ed?

318
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,093
Yes'm.

319
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:07,071
- Guess what?
- Scotch.

320
00:19:07,636 --> 00:19:10,843
I have decided to
dedicate my life to you.

321
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:13,020
- Yes, dear.
- Yes, dear.

322
00:19:14,784 --> 00:19:17,491
That's why I'm gonna give
you the best years of my life.

323
00:19:18,194 --> 00:19:20,458
Mm-hmm.

324
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,047
Do you know what's the matter with you,
you're a "spektic.”

325
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,387
- Hmm?
- Uh, a skeptic.

326
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,826
Yes, dear.

327
00:19:30,413 --> 00:19:32,677
- White beer?
- Homogenized.

328
00:19:34,261 --> 00:19:36,881
Couldn't we spike it
with a little scotch?

329
00:19:37,903 --> 00:19:39,856
Drink that.
As is.

330
00:19:40,176 --> 00:19:43,529
Nora, I love you.

331
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:47,036
Let's get married again.
Tonight.

332
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:59,442
This could bring on my second
childhood. It already has,

333
00:19:59,513 --> 00:20:01,458
Coming here
this time of night.

334
00:20:04,844 --> 00:20:08,200
Nora, I'm free.

335
00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:10,823
Fired. Canned.

336
00:20:10,896 --> 00:20:14,525
No more paper. Nothing
to keep us apart anymore.

337
00:20:14,593 --> 00:20:18,654
- The paper has been sold.
- I know.

338
00:20:26,534 --> 00:20:30,718
Divorce is a very
evil thing, Nora.

339
00:20:30,954 --> 00:20:36,415
Down from my Olympian
heights, I come... humbly.

340
00:20:37,932 --> 00:20:40,321
I'm gonna make a decent
woman of you again, Nora.

341
00:20:40,742 --> 00:20:43,677
- Yes, dear.
- Yes, dear.

342
00:20:44,815 --> 00:20:46,760
We'll go on
a second honeymoon.

343
00:20:46,832 --> 00:20:48,080
We never had a first.

344
00:20:48,104 --> 00:20:51,280
No, I'm leveling, baby.
There's no more paper.

345
00:20:51,753 --> 00:20:53,664
Travel. That's what
we'll do.

346
00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:55,673
Europe, South America, everywhere.

347
00:20:55,786 --> 00:20:57,570
No worry
about expense.

348
00:20:58,101 --> 00:21:00,968
- I am loaded.
- So I noticed.

349
00:21:01,235 --> 00:21:05,188
I mean money. More money than
we've ever had in our lives.

350
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:09,450
I was paid off for being a good boy. Ed.

351
00:21:11,505 --> 00:21:13,092
Listen,

352
00:21:13,771 --> 00:21:16,035
You shouldn't
have come here.

353
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,649
It won't work out.

354
00:21:22,428 --> 00:21:24,214
Yeah.

355
00:21:34,308 --> 00:21:38,494
Not bad copy.
Not bad at all.

356
00:21:39,646 --> 00:21:42,668
How is the advertising business?

357
00:21:43,721 --> 00:21:46,428
You know, you were right
to quit the newspaper.

358
00:21:46,493 --> 00:21:49,115
Now, you've got something
you can depend on.

359
00:21:49,835 --> 00:21:51,914
Something legitimate.

360
00:21:53,198 --> 00:21:56,702
I went to a wake tonight.
Saw the light, sister.

361
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:58,835
Hallelujah.

362
00:22:05,453 --> 00:22:09,059
Why should I fight?
For what?

363
00:22:09,133 --> 00:22:11,400
The publishers don't care
about the paper.

364
00:22:11,425 --> 00:22:13,586
The paper doesn't care
about me.

365
00:22:13,774 --> 00:22:16,549
I don't care about
anybody except you.

366
00:22:17,589 --> 00:22:19,466
Haven't I met him somewhere before?

367
00:22:19,877 --> 00:22:21,772
Just now,
in the living room.

368
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:24,754
Oh, yeah.
Fight. What with?

369
00:22:24,861 --> 00:22:27,597
I'm an employee,
not a stockholder.

370
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,577
Maybe I should have
taken it to the readers.

371
00:22:30,602 --> 00:22:34,527
Ah, what do they care? You
gotta have an issue for that.

372
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:37,523
Red-hot story.

373
00:22:37,594 --> 00:22:39,081
Nora?

374
00:22:39,271 --> 00:22:42,297
- Right here, darling.
- "Right here, darling."

375
00:22:43,082 --> 00:22:46,427
I don't have to think
about anybody but us.

376
00:22:47,136 --> 00:22:49,081
Yes, dear.

377
00:22:49,192 --> 00:22:52,291
You know, we'll have some great
times together like we used to.

378
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:55,932
Remember that time in Saranac when
everybody thought we weren't married,

379
00:22:56,004 --> 00:22:59,256
- So we went out and got married?
- The second time.

380
00:22:59,563 --> 00:23:01,667
And the fishing trips
we never went on.

381
00:23:01,734 --> 00:23:03,734
And the hunting trips
I promised you.

382
00:23:03,872 --> 00:23:05,965
- We'll make them all this time.
- Yes, dear.

383
00:23:06,089 --> 00:23:09,536
How I went up to Reno to
try to stop the divorce.

384
00:23:09,963 --> 00:23:12,898
What was that you charged
me with? Incompatibility.

385
00:23:12,972 --> 00:23:16,718
Incompatibility.
Huh, that was a lie.

386
00:23:16,772 --> 00:23:18,340
They know
where to reach you?

387
00:23:18,365 --> 00:23:21,563
- Oh, I don't have to account to anybody.
- Yes, dear.

388
00:23:24,394 --> 00:23:26,305
I don't like him.

389
00:23:26,618 --> 00:23:28,552
I'll think
of a reason later.

390
00:23:28,577 --> 00:23:30,317
Good night, dear.

391
00:24:01,845 --> 00:24:05,692
City desk. What?

392
00:24:06,565 --> 00:24:08,613
Oh. Hold it.

393
00:24:14,084 --> 00:24:16,181
Okay, go ahead.

394
00:24:17,071 --> 00:24:19,392
When did this happen?

395
00:24:19,504 --> 00:24:21,313
What time is it now?

396
00:24:21,491 --> 00:24:23,972
Six what?
6:20.

397
00:24:24,592 --> 00:24:26,545
Where'd it happen?

398
00:24:27,442 --> 00:24:29,428
Did you call
the hospital?

399
00:24:30,107 --> 00:24:32,428
Are they sending
an ambulance?

400
00:24:33,433 --> 00:24:34,941
Okay.

401
00:24:37,387 --> 00:24:40,231
- Good morning, darling.
- Ed...

402
00:24:40,596 --> 00:24:43,370
I thought no one
knew you were here.

403
00:24:43,395 --> 00:24:45,454
Where else would I go
when I'm in trouble?

404
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:48,340
- Ed...
- Who slept here?

405
00:24:48,412 --> 00:24:50,357
But it's time we had a talk, Ed.

406
00:24:50,382 --> 00:24:52,630
Oh, no, not now, baby.
I'm in a hurry.

407
00:24:52,703 --> 00:24:55,092
- That call was urgent.
- Dinner tonight?

408
00:24:55,207 --> 00:24:57,471
- Why not every night?
- Alberto's place Ok?

409
00:24:57,944 --> 00:25:00,877
8:00. I thought you were in a hurry.

410
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,810
Did I have a pleasant time last night?

411
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,939
- Yes, dear.
- I did?

412
00:25:06,083 --> 00:25:08,096
Well, what
do you know.

413
00:25:18,257 --> 00:25:21,652
I was making my rounds, sir.
First, I didn't notice anything.

414
00:25:21,677 --> 00:25:24,556
Then I heard a kind of low moaning
coming from the road down there.

415
00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:25,943
Well, good morning.

416
00:25:26,705 --> 00:25:29,101
- Automobile accident, eh?
- Get him to the hospital.

417
00:25:29,243 --> 00:25:31,203
- Name?
- I said, get him to the hospital!

418
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,439
Wait a minute...

419
00:25:32,593 --> 00:25:34,092
My name is Burrows.

420
00:25:34,162 --> 00:25:36,938
I work for The Day.
He runs it.

421
00:25:37,478 --> 00:25:39,833
Oh. Ben!

422
00:25:44,689 --> 00:25:47,515
They started banging me around
when they got me in the car.

423
00:25:48,055 --> 00:25:49,575
How many were there?

424
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:52,463
- Three, maybe four.
- Well, what was it? Three or four?

425
00:25:52,488 --> 00:25:53,784
I don't know.

426
00:25:54,048 --> 00:25:56,753
All right. They gave you
a going-Over. What with?

427
00:25:56,853 --> 00:25:57,885
Fists.

428
00:25:57,991 --> 00:26:01,506
One of 'em hit me in the face with
something hard. A sap, I guess.

429
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,536
- What'd they say?
- Nothing. Not after they got me in the car.

430
00:26:04,561 --> 00:26:06,100
- Before?
- Yes...

431
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:07,665
Outside the hall of records.
I told you.

432
00:26:07,762 --> 00:26:09,082
- Tell me again.
- Please, sir. He's...

433
00:26:09,106 --> 00:26:11,138
Shut up.
The hall of records.

434
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,813
You went there
to check on Rienzi.

435
00:26:14,678 --> 00:26:15,879
George.

436
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,082
The man I talked to
must have tipped Rienzi.

437
00:26:19,466 --> 00:26:21,858
- Yeah? How do you know?
- He left the office for a few minutes.

438
00:26:22,245 --> 00:26:23,300
Probably phoned.

439
00:26:23,325 --> 00:26:25,199
- Probably? But you're not positive.
- No.

440
00:26:25,433 --> 00:26:26,578
That won't stand up in court.

441
00:26:26,602 --> 00:26:29,231
How else were they waiting
for me when I came out?

442
00:26:29,508 --> 00:26:32,033
- Who was waiting?
- Rienzi's men.

443
00:26:32,081 --> 00:26:33,343
Can you identify them?

444
00:26:33,367 --> 00:26:36,939
One, maybe.
A former boxer, Torpedo.

445
00:26:37,618 --> 00:26:42,126
- Know his name?
- Whitey. I'm not sure. Whitey something.

446
00:26:42,151 --> 00:26:44,093
If I brought him in,
could you identify him?

447
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:47,079
He asked me if I was Burrows.
He asked me If I worked for The Day.

448
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:49,162
- What make car was it?
- I don't know.

449
00:26:49,187 --> 00:26:50,430
Sedan? Blue? Black?

450
00:26:50,454 --> 00:26:52,320
What? What are you trying to do,
protect Rienzi?

451
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:54,018
I want facts
that won't bounce.

452
00:26:54,304 --> 00:26:57,027
Facts that'll stand up against
Rienzi's lawyers and libel suits.

453
00:26:57,052 --> 00:26:59,457
Facts that'll tear Rienzi's
syndicate wide open.

454
00:26:59,807 --> 00:27:03,607
There just can't be any mistake.
We can't have any retractions.

455
00:27:05,382 --> 00:27:07,259
George.

456
00:27:21,585 --> 00:27:24,543
- How's it look?
- I'm afraid he may lose that eye.

457
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,131
Mrs. Burrows.

458
00:27:28,723 --> 00:27:31,339
Go away, Mr. Hutcheson.
Let us alone.

459
00:27:31,407 --> 00:27:32,781
Are you blaming me?

460
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,859
Who sent him out?
And for what?

461
00:27:36,072 --> 00:27:38,627
The great big, fat glory
of a newspaper?

462
00:27:38,898 --> 00:27:41,002
A paper you haven't
even got anymore.

463
00:27:44,475 --> 00:27:47,126
Mr. Allen? One moment, please.
The Day, good morning.

464
00:27:47,873 --> 00:27:50,285
Put every man you can
spare on the Rienzi story.

465
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:52,383
- Picture layout?
- The works. Where he gets his money,

466
00:27:52,408 --> 00:27:54,854
His tie-ups, data, facts,
facts and more facts.

467
00:27:54,879 --> 00:27:57,484
- The tough thing is to prove them, Ed.
- Prove them later.

468
00:27:58,716 --> 00:28:00,661
- Charlie.
- Boy.

469
00:28:00,772 --> 00:28:04,060
Uh, city morgue? This is
Willebrandt of The Day.

470
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:07,144
Any identification yet on
that nude in the fur coat?

471
00:28:08,005 --> 00:28:10,241
Miss Barndollar.
Relax.

472
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,557
Ever heard of Rienzi?
Mm-hmm.

473
00:28:12,621 --> 00:28:15,578
- Okay, now.
- Rienzi, Tomas. Fifty-One.

474
00:28:15,649 --> 00:28:19,295
Born, Palermo, Sicily.
Emigrated here, 1914.

475
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:21,284
Attended public
school number 47.

476
00:28:21,309 --> 00:28:23,286
Has two children
by legal wife Gertrude.

477
00:28:23,311 --> 00:28:25,231
We're not proposing him
for the chamber of commerce.

478
00:28:25,275 --> 00:28:27,282
We want to convict him of
every known crime in the books,

479
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:30,032
All of which he's committed and some
even you, even I, never heard of.

480
00:28:30,057 --> 00:28:31,884
- I want everything.
- Yes, sir.

481
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:34,939
I must've taken 20 shots of her as
they were dragging her out of the river.

482
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,657
- That fur coat's worth $5000 or $6000
- Tim, get your camera.

483
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:40,831
- Cover Burrows in the city hospital.
- George? Our George?

484
00:28:40,856 --> 00:28:44,033
That's right. You take Rienzi,
his wife, home, cars, everything.

485
00:28:44,058 --> 00:28:46,327
What if he smashes the
camera? He's done it before.

486
00:28:46,352 --> 00:28:48,767
Let him. You get
pictures of him doin' it.

487
00:28:49,074 --> 00:28:50,439
Go ahead.

488
00:28:51,609 --> 00:28:54,806
Bill...
Bill, I want a cartoon on Rienzi.

489
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:57,104
It's gotta be hard,
tough, below the belt.

490
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,650
A vulture sucking the life out of a city.
You got it?

491
00:29:01,062 --> 00:29:03,699
But a vulture only preys on
the dead or the dying.

492
00:29:04,791 --> 00:29:06,141
Preys.

493
00:29:06,908 --> 00:29:09,924
"Let us prey." P-R-E-Y.

494
00:29:09,949 --> 00:29:12,068
The paper, the paper.
Why should I stick my neck out?

495
00:29:12,093 --> 00:29:13,875
I want it
for the first edition.

496
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:18,159
I don't like the idea. I get in a jam with
Rienzi and tomorrow the paper folds anyway.

497
00:29:18,184 --> 00:29:20,626
- Where does that leave me?
- You're fired.

498
00:29:20,651 --> 00:29:22,464
- Wait a minute
- Pay him off and get him out of here.

499
00:29:22,488 --> 00:29:24,226
Why the excitement?
Everybody knows we're washed up.

500
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,226
That's your mistake.

501
00:29:25,251 --> 00:29:27,355
- But I worked here four years.
- That's my mistake.

502
00:29:28,443 --> 00:29:29,985
Boy.

503
00:29:30,095 --> 00:29:31,869
City desk.
Get your voucher.

504
00:29:33,616 --> 00:29:35,516
Miss Bentley, get your
stenotype in there.

505
00:29:35,541 --> 00:29:37,554
Get Dr. Emmanuel
on the phone.

506
00:29:37,738 --> 00:29:41,153
Draw $500 out of my bank and
get it over to Burrows's wife.

507
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,383
Mr. Bellamy here's
been waiting.

508
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:44,966
Oh, yeah.

509
00:29:45,613 --> 00:29:49,253
- Rewrite desk. Lobster shift.
- What's the lobster shift?

510
00:29:49,295 --> 00:29:51,343
After midnight
we serve lobsters.

511
00:29:51,568 --> 00:29:53,396
Thermidor, naturally.

512
00:29:54,124 --> 00:29:55,863
Uh-

513
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:59,161
Page one editorial. Ten
point type. Double column.

514
00:30:00,093 --> 00:30:01,597
Byline,

515
00:30:02,087 --> 00:30:04,601
Set off in boldface,
will be:

516
00:30:06,649 --> 00:30:08,887
John Garrison.

517
00:30:09,372 --> 00:30:10,573
Quote:

518
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,777
<i>I am dead.</i>

519
00:30:15,667 --> 00:30:17,893
<i>I've been dead for 11 years.</i>

520
00:30:18,644 --> 00:30:21,611
<i>By tomorrow, this newspaper
may also be dead.</i>

521
00:30:22,431 --> 00:30:26,424
<i>But as long as it lives, The Day
will continue to report the facts...</i>

522
00:30:26,497 --> 00:30:30,128
<i>and the meaning of
those facts without fear...</i>

523
00:30:30,756 --> 00:30:34,062
<i>without distortion, without
hope of personal gain...</i>

524
00:30:34,428 --> 00:30:36,919
<i>as it always has done.</i>

525
00:30:38,033 --> 00:30:40,297
- Yes?
- Dr. Emmanuel on two.

526
00:30:42,356 --> 00:30:46,190
Hello, doctor.
No, no, no. I'm fine.

527
00:30:46,835 --> 00:30:49,371
Yeah, uh, I want to ask you a favor.

528
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:54,142
A personal friend of mine needs
your help. He's in the city hospital.

529
00:30:54,295 --> 00:30:58,179
Name is Burrows,
George Burrows. What?

530
00:31:00,018 --> 00:31:01,888
What is
more important, doctor,

531
00:31:01,913 --> 00:31:05,348
Your delivering a lecture in
London or saving a man's eyesight?

532
00:31:05,884 --> 00:31:07,135
Well, cancel it.

533
00:31:07,561 --> 00:31:09,167
Well, then delay it.

534
00:31:10,031 --> 00:31:12,488
We weren't too busy to
raise funds for your clinic.

535
00:31:12,741 --> 00:31:14,634
Well, certainly I'm putting
it on a personal basis.

536
00:31:14,659 --> 00:31:16,847
What's a friend for,
if not for a favor?

537
00:31:17,673 --> 00:31:19,027
Thank you.

538
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:22,890
A real humanitarian.

539
00:31:23,879 --> 00:31:27,213
Oh. Where was I?

540
00:31:27,884 --> 00:31:30,855
<i>Will continue to report the facts
and the meaning of those facts.</i>

541
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,551
Oh, that sentence
is too long.

542
00:31:32,727 --> 00:31:35,322
Break it down. Change
the word "distortion."

543
00:31:35,347 --> 00:31:38,345
Somebody mightn't know
what it means. Okay?

544
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,875
Paragraph. Quote:

545
00:31:41,681 --> 00:31:43,461
<i>What are the facts?</i>

546
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:46,399
<i>Rienzi stuffs your ballot boxes.</i>

547
00:32:16,918 --> 00:32:19,355
If anything will save
the paper, this is it.

548
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:29,915
You see the paper yet?

549
00:32:30,975 --> 00:32:33,585
- Who's responsible?
- Obviously Hutcheson.

550
00:32:33,927 --> 00:32:35,757
- Hutcheson?
- Afraid so.

551
00:32:36,306 --> 00:32:38,025
Well, talk to him.

552
00:32:39,872 --> 00:32:41,707
Why can't you?

553
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,984
I wanna meet him
personally.

554
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,399
Why not?

555
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:55,803
Everybody can be reached.
Remember, judge?

556
00:32:57,107 --> 00:32:58,216
Evening, Mr. White.

557
00:32:58,241 --> 00:33:00,075
Evening, Mr. White.
Mr. White.

558
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,523
Give me a three column lead
with two line bank on that raid.

559
00:33:02,636 --> 00:33:05,407
Evening, Mr. White. Did you see
this spread on Rienzi in The Day?

560
00:33:05,432 --> 00:33:07,651
- Yes, sir.
- What have you done about it for our paper?

561
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:09,685
Done, sir? A reporter
gets into a barroom brawl?

562
00:33:09,717 --> 00:33:12,214
- They say it was Rienzi.
- But can they prove it?

563
00:33:12,239 --> 00:33:14,999
- Pr-Prove it?
- Front page editorials, flashy cartoons...

564
00:33:15,024 --> 00:33:16,592
Why, it's old-Fashioned,
Mr. White.

565
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:19,746
And what's so ultramodern
about this horse in our paper?

566
00:33:20,387 --> 00:33:23,181
Then give me some old-Fashioned
journalism in The Standard.

567
00:33:23,206 --> 00:33:24,279
Yes, sir.

568
00:33:26,142 --> 00:33:27,916
Get me the city hospital.

569
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:32,031
Sorry I'm late.

570
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:35,270
- You like it?
- It's the best looking front page in town.

571
00:33:35,334 --> 00:33:36,536
As usual.

572
00:33:36,635 --> 00:33:37,859
- The makeup...
- Thank you.

573
00:33:37,884 --> 00:33:40,910
The cartoon, the editorial
under the name of Garrison.

574
00:33:40,934 --> 00:33:42,131
- Yours?
- Mm-hmm.

575
00:33:42,156 --> 00:33:43,871
- It's wonderful.
- As usual.

576
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,563
And how are we? Are we as usual?

577
00:33:46,932 --> 00:33:48,924
Maybe the heirs will
sit up and take notice.

578
00:33:48,949 --> 00:33:51,774
- Of us?
- They won't sell the paper. Not now.

579
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:54,882
Not in the middle of a fight like this.
It would be like endorsing Rienzi.

580
00:33:54,928 --> 00:33:57,123
It's a wonderful dress for dinner.

581
00:33:57,422 --> 00:33:59,356
You look much better
than you did last night.

582
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,318
- How do you feel?
- Amorous.

583
00:34:01,343 --> 00:34:03,173
- Good evening, Mrs. Hutcheson.
- Evening.

584
00:34:03,198 --> 00:34:05,553
Mr. Hutcheson. Your table's ready, sir.
Will you order now?

585
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:09,337
- An appetizer first perhaps?
- Oh, no, thank you. I have mine.

586
00:34:09,676 --> 00:34:12,494
- Oh, just steak for me.
- Telephone, Mr. Hutcheson.

587
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:15,756
- Tell them I'm feeding.
- They said it's important.

588
00:34:15,901 --> 00:34:18,734
Urgent, dear.
As usual.

589
00:34:22,682 --> 00:34:25,242
- Keep calling her Mrs. Hutcheson.
- Yes, sir.

590
00:34:26,043 --> 00:34:27,817
Uh, Mrs. Hutcheson.

591
00:34:31,293 --> 00:34:32,374
Yes?

592
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:34,408
This is Willebrandt.
I'm at the city morgue.

593
00:34:34,529 --> 00:34:36,679
The place where little girls
check their fur coats.

594
00:34:38,017 --> 00:34:39,891
The dead nude?
What about her?

595
00:34:40,101 --> 00:34:42,561
Well, her mother showed up to
identify her this afternoon.

596
00:34:42,586 --> 00:34:44,497
It's a...
A Mrs. Schmidt.

597
00:34:44,962 --> 00:34:46,842
That's the girl's name,
Bessie Schmidt.

598
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:50,180
But she also used
the name Sally Gardiner.

599
00:34:50,398 --> 00:34:52,359
Why bother me?
Write it.

600
00:34:52,384 --> 00:34:54,386
Well, what I wanted
to know is this.

601
00:34:54,411 --> 00:34:58,394
Now, Allen thought I ought to
check with you first, but uh,

602
00:35:00,013 --> 00:35:03,926
This Mrs. Schmidt knows a lot
more than she's telling.

603
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,588
No.

604
00:35:06,961 --> 00:35:09,603
No, but I thought maybe if you
talked to her, you could get...

605
00:35:09,628 --> 00:35:11,437
Let's not be
dramatic, Mrs. Willebrandt.

606
00:35:11,525 --> 00:35:13,300
No, no, no, I can't.
You handle it.

607
00:35:25,711 --> 00:35:28,551
Her name's Fifi. She made a
pass at me in the cloakroom.

608
00:35:28,576 --> 00:35:30,708
It's a way
I have with women.

609
00:35:32,556 --> 00:35:35,457
I'm getting married
again, Ed.

610
00:35:39,911 --> 00:35:42,397
That's right. I'm giving
it to you straight and fast.

611
00:35:43,102 --> 00:35:47,168
You don't know the man. He-he's
my boss at the advertising agency.

612
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,155
First me,
now another boss.

613
00:35:50,265 --> 00:35:52,244
It's getting to be a
habit with you, isn't it?

614
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,690
- I'd like you to meet him.
- Compare notes, you mean?

615
00:35:54,909 --> 00:35:56,945
Thanks, I know
enough people already.

616
00:35:57,061 --> 00:35:59,837
- His name is Lewis Shafer.
- I don't want to know anything about him.

617
00:35:59,974 --> 00:36:02,156
- I told him all about you.
- Everything?

618
00:36:02,709 --> 00:36:04,090
Sit down.

619
00:36:05,034 --> 00:36:07,070
I'm not one
of your modern husbands,

620
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:09,528
Chin up, stiff upper lip
and all that sort of stuff,

621
00:36:09,641 --> 00:36:11,529
Always ready
to discuss things sensibly.

622
00:36:11,597 --> 00:36:14,589
There isn't anything to discuss.
I don't need your consent.

623
00:36:14,702 --> 00:36:17,295
- We're divorced. Have been for two years
- I don't recognize the divorce.

624
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:19,549
- You agreed to it.
- I was wrong.

625
00:36:19,662 --> 00:36:23,428
You're my wife. Not only because
somebody said a few words over us,

626
00:36:23,453 --> 00:36:25,967
But because of all we meant to
each other for eight years.

627
00:36:25,992 --> 00:36:29,148
You can't change all that with
more words, legal or otherwise.

628
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:31,290
They want you on the telephone,
Mr. Hutcheson.

629
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,344
Go away.

630
00:36:32,758 --> 00:36:35,438
You want me to quit the paper, okay.
I'll get another job, something...

631
00:36:35,552 --> 00:36:38,552
- I don't want you to quit
- I had to go back today. Tomorrow, it's over.

632
00:36:38,577 --> 00:36:41,897
It's right that you should go back.
It's where you belong.

633
00:36:41,922 --> 00:36:44,078
You're the best
newspaperman in the world.

634
00:36:45,097 --> 00:36:47,645
I don't want to change
that. I never did.

635
00:36:48,063 --> 00:36:50,761
It's your whole life,
and for you, it's right.

636
00:36:51,231 --> 00:36:54,789
But I've got a right to a life too,
and you can't give it to me.

637
00:36:55,802 --> 00:36:58,220
- Can he?
- Maybe.

638
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:04,018
Can you be the same with him as you were
with me? Is it that easy?

639
00:37:05,972 --> 00:37:07,481
Do you love him?

640
00:37:09,173 --> 00:37:12,233
No, you don't.
Not the same way.

641
00:37:12,811 --> 00:37:15,850
Maybe love isn't enough
to make a marriage work.

642
00:37:16,293 --> 00:37:18,579
Please, Mr. Hutcheson.

643
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:21,687
I'm sorry to bother you
again, but it's your office.

644
00:37:21,802 --> 00:37:26,694
Mr. Allen. He said if you won't come to
the phone than to come back to the paper.

645
00:37:27,032 --> 00:37:28,875
I'm sorry, sir.

646
00:37:43,183 --> 00:37:44,410
Yes?

647
00:37:46,394 --> 00:37:49,596
What?
Yanked what story?

648
00:37:50,096 --> 00:37:52,960
Willebrandt's story
on Sally Gardiner.

649
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:56,353
Well, it was pulled
by our advertising department.

650
00:37:57,485 --> 00:38:01,706
It seems Mr. Andrew Wharton,
president of Wharton's department store,

651
00:38:01,731 --> 00:38:03,226
Was Sally's caviar ticket.

652
00:38:04,774 --> 00:38:07,706
Right. Right.

653
00:38:08,588 --> 00:38:11,967
Composing room. One column head
one bank on this weather report.

654
00:38:12,235 --> 00:38:13,759
- Yes?
- Jake?

655
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:16,266
On Willebrandt's story,
Sally Gardiner?

656
00:38:16,507 --> 00:38:19,567
Yeah. Hold it,
but don't kill it.

657
00:38:30,702 --> 00:38:33,375
You worry about every story
in our paper, Mr. Fenway?

658
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,162
It just seemed to me
this was libelous material.

659
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:37,265
We got a hundred
stories in this issue.

660
00:38:37,289 --> 00:38:38,746
- Check 'em all for libel?
- No, sir.

661
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:39,787
Or any of them?
No, sir.

662
00:38:39,812 --> 00:38:44,142
I see. You're a self-appointed censor
only on stories involving big advertisers.

663
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:47,136
- I was trying to protect us.
- Us or you or Mr. Wharton, and for how much?

664
00:38:47,161 --> 00:38:49,562
- He denies this story.
- Willebrandt included his denial.

665
00:38:49,587 --> 00:38:50,877
From there on,
it's up to the police.

666
00:38:50,901 --> 00:38:53,005
- I thought as a matter of policy
- Policy?

667
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:57,251
Since when has the advertising department
of this paper dictated its policy on news?

668
00:38:57,276 --> 00:38:58,640
I didn't act on my own.

669
00:38:58,664 --> 00:39:01,231
No. You haven't got the guts,
so you went to Wharton.

670
00:39:01,546 --> 00:39:03,826
- Run the story.
- I talked to Alice Garrison.

671
00:39:03,903 --> 00:39:06,194
Mr. Wharton came here. We phoned
her. It was on her authority.

672
00:39:06,219 --> 00:39:08,734
She hasn't got the authority,
not until I'm out of here.

673
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,852
- Or have you arranged for that too?
- No, sir.

674
00:39:12,195 --> 00:39:13,448
You're slipping.

675
00:39:14,077 --> 00:39:17,080
Well, you talk to Mr. Wharton.
He's waiting right in here.

676
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:19,268
Mr. Wharton.

677
00:39:19,631 --> 00:39:22,043
- This is Mr. Hutcheson.
- How do you do, sir?

678
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,622
- May I give you my side of it?
- I'll take care of this.

679
00:39:30,713 --> 00:39:33,589
- Please don't publish that story.
- Why? Isn't it true?

680
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,977
It can't do you much good,
and it'll ruin me and hurt my family.

681
00:39:37,251 --> 00:39:39,867
I've been doing business
with your paper for 20 years.

682
00:39:41,004 --> 00:39:42,735
You're a big advertiser,
Mr. Wharton.

683
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,586
We need your business,
but not on those terms.

684
00:39:44,611 --> 00:39:45,410
All right.

685
00:39:45,435 --> 00:39:48,585
I made a mistake with Sally,
but that was 10 years ago,

686
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:51,055
And I've paid for it
in blackmail every month.

687
00:39:51,148 --> 00:39:53,491
I'm sorry, Mr. Wharton.
This is a matter for the police.

688
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,882
You are interested in facts,
aren't you?

689
00:39:57,545 --> 00:39:59,219
One day, Sally phoned.

690
00:39:59,686 --> 00:40:03,477
She was quitting her job at the store.
She was letting me off the hook.

691
00:40:04,179 --> 00:40:07,340
- She said there was another man.
- Another man? There always is.

692
00:40:07,365 --> 00:40:09,769
In this case,
the man was Tomas Rienzi.

693
00:40:10,029 --> 00:40:13,257
Sally said she loved him,
would never bother me again.

694
00:40:13,282 --> 00:40:17,946
She even sent back some...
damaging photographs... of us.

695
00:40:18,139 --> 00:40:19,777
She said she was
set for life.

696
00:40:19,802 --> 00:40:22,343
- What did she mean by that?
- She didn't say.

697
00:40:24,189 --> 00:40:26,077
Surely you don't think
I killed Sally.

698
00:40:26,102 --> 00:40:27,556
I haven't seen her
in over two years.

699
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:30,633
Mrs. Wharton knew about Sally.
She suggested that I talk to you.

700
00:40:30,658 --> 00:40:33,656
Your paper forced me to come
here, but now that I'm here,

701
00:40:34,103 --> 00:40:35,713
I don't know...

702
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:41,124
Wharton, you can tell your wife I'm
holding the story. Thank you, sir.

703
00:40:41,155 --> 00:40:43,680
- But if that yarn about Rienzi doesn't jell.
- It will.

704
00:40:43,956 --> 00:40:45,730
It better,
for both our sakes.

705
00:40:47,118 --> 00:40:49,700
- Jim?
- Later, dear.

706
00:40:49,922 --> 00:40:51,799
What have you got
on Sally Gardiner?

707
00:40:51,985 --> 00:40:53,381
The furry blonde?
Uh-huh.

708
00:40:53,613 --> 00:40:56,070
- She was a broad.
- Yes, but whose?

709
00:40:56,494 --> 00:40:59,488
- Since when do you go in for gossip?
- Since now.

710
00:41:03,575 --> 00:41:07,409
Jim, was Rienzi
playin' around with Sally?

711
00:41:07,555 --> 00:41:10,548
- What do you want?
- Proof. I want to be sure.

712
00:41:10,955 --> 00:41:13,560
From this, a fella
could catch a hole in the head.

713
00:41:13,636 --> 00:41:15,866
Yeah, he could.
That bother you?

714
00:41:15,982 --> 00:41:18,621
Oh, no. No, no, no.

715
00:41:27,596 --> 00:41:29,473
Harry?

716
00:41:30,636 --> 00:41:32,672
Ever hear of Herman Schmidt?

717
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:35,812
Small-Time stuff. Had some kind
of a political job at the arena.

718
00:41:35,837 --> 00:41:37,123
Boxing judge, I think.

719
00:41:37,148 --> 00:41:40,057
Oh, yeah. I got him now.
Brother of Sally Gardiner.

720
00:41:41,033 --> 00:41:43,020
Sally may have been tied in
with Rienzi.

721
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:46,584
I know one thing. Rienzi's tied in
with the boxing commission.

722
00:41:48,118 --> 00:41:51,498
Yeah. Get a hold of Schmidt.
Sweat him.

723
00:41:52,121 --> 00:41:54,442
'Bout his job?
About Sally.

724
00:41:54,647 --> 00:41:56,626
Boy!
Here's Willebrandt's copy.

725
00:41:56,698 --> 00:42:00,020
All we've got on Sally is
she was once a bathing beauty.

726
00:42:00,131 --> 00:42:02,645
One thing you're short on
is time.

727
00:42:02,716 --> 00:42:04,786
Sally and her brother
were born here.

728
00:42:04,901 --> 00:42:07,802
Her mother came from Germany.
Father dead.

729
00:42:07,905 --> 00:42:11,706
No known criminal record for
Sally. No recorded marriages.

730
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,309
Yes?

731
00:42:14,334 --> 00:42:16,973
A Mr. Lewis Shafer
to see you.

732
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,960
Okay.

733
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:24,634
Barndollar?

734
00:42:24,658 --> 00:42:26,173
- Yes, sir?
- Relax...

735
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:29,601
If Luggerman's closed the financial page,
ask him to come in.

736
00:42:29,626 --> 00:42:30,880
Yes, sir.

737
00:42:38,216 --> 00:42:39,943
Happy to meet you, Mr.-
Yeah.

738
00:42:40,092 --> 00:42:42,196
Got those pictures?
Uh, right here.

739
00:42:42,667 --> 00:42:44,510
Put 'em up here,
chronologically.

740
00:42:44,535 --> 00:42:46,559
Sit down, Mr. Shafer.
Thank you, but what I...

741
00:42:46,594 --> 00:42:49,620
Leave a space for the missing
period between Wharton and Rienzi.

742
00:42:49,645 --> 00:42:50,645
Yes, sir.

743
00:42:50,919 --> 00:42:53,319
Coffee, Mr. Shafer?
Sandwich? No, thanks.

744
00:42:53,397 --> 00:42:55,205
I didn't mean
to interrupt your work.

745
00:42:56,026 --> 00:42:58,486
How's my wife? That's what
I came to see you about.

746
00:42:58,511 --> 00:43:00,524
Shoot.
Well-

747
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,879
Nora ask you to come?
Well, of course not.

748
00:43:03,138 --> 00:43:04,886
I thought that we could...

749
00:43:05,466 --> 00:43:07,377
Well, this is rather personal,
Mr. Hutcheson.

750
00:43:07,491 --> 00:43:11,389
Inasmuch as it concerns my wife,
I hope it's not too personal.

751
00:43:11,709 --> 00:43:14,109
- You're making her very unhappy-
- Want me?

752
00:43:14,307 --> 00:43:18,492
Oh, Luggerman. I want a report on all
Rienzi's investments, legit and otherwise-

753
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,830
Dummy corporations, everything. Real
estate, manufacturing, investments-

754
00:43:21,964 --> 00:43:24,214
Whatever you can dig up.
You got a starting point?

755
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:27,138
Try the tax reports. Charlie in the
governor's office might give you a hand.

756
00:43:27,163 --> 00:43:28,550
- Right.
- Make it thorough.

757
00:43:32,112 --> 00:43:35,393
So I'm, uh, making her
unhappy, Mr. Shafer?

758
00:43:35,504 --> 00:43:38,200
Let her alone. You're confusing
her, making her feel guilty.

759
00:43:38,225 --> 00:43:40,136
Her responsibility
to you is over.

760
00:43:40,161 --> 00:43:43,258
Well, then why are you here? I'm only
trying to do what's best for Nora.

761
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:46,562
Well, that's not only ridiculous, but
insulting. You're not that much of a prize.

762
00:43:46,587 --> 00:43:48,913
Ed, here's the...
Oh, excuse me.

763
00:43:49,984 --> 00:43:51,246
What have you got?

764
00:43:51,271 --> 00:43:53,182
Sally bought some
government bonds. When?

765
00:43:53,207 --> 00:43:55,107
Five months ago.
Sally or Rienzi?

766
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:58,569
In her name. 40,000 worth. And
it took some doing at this hour,

767
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,855
But we've got a checkup working
in every bank for saving accounts.

768
00:44:00,879 --> 00:44:02,756
- Safety deposit boxes?
- That too.

769
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:04,280
That's all we've got.
Okay.

770
00:44:04,305 --> 00:44:05,786
Look here, Frank.

771
00:44:06,495 --> 00:44:09,625
Sally as a high school girl, model
for Wharton's department store,

772
00:44:09,649 --> 00:44:13,716
Showgirl, kept girl,
missing portion, the river.

773
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:16,908
Now If we can plug up this hole between
Wharton's department store and the river,

774
00:44:16,932 --> 00:44:18,967
Fill it up with Rienzi...

775
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,381
Goodbye, Mr. Shafer.
I can't wish you good luck.

776
00:44:22,405 --> 00:44:23,418
You know how it is.

777
00:44:23,442 --> 00:44:25,147
There's something you ought to know,
Mr. Hutcheson.

778
00:44:25,171 --> 00:44:27,670
Yes?
Jim Cleary on one.

779
00:44:27,881 --> 00:44:31,384
Yes, Jim? Nora and I are
getting married tomorrow night.

780
00:44:32,758 --> 00:44:33,913
Ed? Ed!

781
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:38,472
I thought it best not to delay any longer.
You know how it is.

782
00:44:39,854 --> 00:44:42,334
- Ed?
- Yes, yes. Go ahead.

783
00:44:42,408 --> 00:44:44,613
Here it is, just what
you've been looking for.

784
00:44:45,234 --> 00:44:48,009
Yeah. Rienzi's your boy,
all right.

785
00:44:48,075 --> 00:44:49,980
Showgirl in a musical
produced by Al Murray.

786
00:44:50,004 --> 00:44:52,781
The show was backed by
Rienzi over three years ago.

787
00:44:52,806 --> 00:44:53,597
Frank...

788
00:44:53,622 --> 00:44:57,269
Oh, it's the only show Rienzi backed.
He insisted Sally be in it.

789
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:59,768
I'm with Al Murray now.

790
00:45:00,529 --> 00:45:04,363
He says that Rienzi used to send a car
around for her every night after the show.

791
00:45:04,475 --> 00:45:05,477
- Hold it.
- Yep.

792
00:45:05,617 --> 00:45:07,387
Switch this call to rewrite.
You hear that, Cleary?

793
00:45:07,411 --> 00:45:08,711
- Yep, yep.
- Okay.

794
00:45:09,878 --> 00:45:11,345
Oh, Frank.

795
00:45:11,878 --> 00:45:14,641
On the Willebrandt story, uh,
kill the part about Wharton.

796
00:45:14,666 --> 00:45:16,702
Use Cleary's story
for a lead-all.

797
00:45:16,857 --> 00:45:19,246
Throw in Sally's face.
No nudity.

798
00:45:25,125 --> 00:45:27,299
- Miss Barndollar?
- Yes, sir?

799
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:29,689
I want a complete check
on Lewis Shafer,

800
00:45:29,759 --> 00:45:32,478
Runs the united
advertising agency.

801
00:45:32,584 --> 00:45:34,355
- Shafer.
- Yes, sir.

802
00:45:35,329 --> 00:45:36,465
Yes, sir?

803
00:45:36,652 --> 00:45:38,899
- Anything from Thompson yet?
- No, sir.

804
00:45:51,473 --> 00:45:52,977
Mr. Schmidt?

805
00:45:58,772 --> 00:46:00,284
Mr. Schmidt?

806
00:46:07,379 --> 00:46:08,384
Don't move.

807
00:46:08,409 --> 00:46:10,052
- I just wanna...
- Shut up!

808
00:46:15,027 --> 00:46:16,881
Take your hat off.

809
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:23,116
Sit down.
No, over there.

810
00:46:27,207 --> 00:46:28,890
Put your hands on the table.

811
00:46:32,912 --> 00:46:35,346
Relax, Herman.
I'm here to help you.

812
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:37,851
- Who's with you?
- Nobody.

813
00:46:39,654 --> 00:46:41,065
What's the pitch?

814
00:46:41,689 --> 00:46:44,044
My name is Thompson.
Reporter, sports,

815
00:46:44,144 --> 00:46:45,935
- for The Day...
- Don't do that.

816
00:46:48,676 --> 00:46:49,865
Sports, huh?

817
00:46:53,362 --> 00:46:54,751
What'd you write today?

818
00:47:00,557 --> 00:47:03,878
<i>The question of televising
next season's baseball games...</i>

819
00:47:03,903 --> 00:47:08,219
<i>was discussed at a heated session
of the hot stove league yesterday.</i>

820
00:47:12,535 --> 00:47:13,703
What do you want?

821
00:47:14,336 --> 00:47:16,349
Do you mind
putting that thing away?

822
00:47:17,371 --> 00:47:18,758
How did you find me?

823
00:47:19,071 --> 00:47:20,929
You know a lot of people
in the fight game.

824
00:47:20,953 --> 00:47:23,421
They owe me favors.
I collected a few.

825
00:47:24,304 --> 00:47:26,174
All right. Get to it.

826
00:47:29,821 --> 00:47:32,494
Why did Rienzi...
kill your sister?

827
00:47:34,169 --> 00:47:35,955
Did he?

828
00:47:37,596 --> 00:47:41,244
Then who you afraid of,
Herman? Why the hideout?

829
00:47:42,539 --> 00:47:44,130
That won't get you anywhere.

830
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:47,311
I phoned your address in to
the paper. They know I'm here.

831
00:47:47,754 --> 00:47:50,268
By the next edition,
Rienzi'll know where you are.

832
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:57,369
We're your only chance, Herman.

833
00:47:57,506 --> 00:47:59,542
Let me take you to the paper
and you'll be safe.

834
00:48:01,739 --> 00:48:03,639
Sooner or later,
Rienzi'll get to you,

835
00:48:03,664 --> 00:48:05,677
And you'll wind up
in the morgue beside Sally.

836
00:48:09,411 --> 00:48:12,448
As long as Rienzi is free,
you're a dead pigeon.

837
00:48:15,917 --> 00:48:17,423
Take your time.

838
00:48:18,188 --> 00:48:21,601
Rienzi won't get his copy of the
day with your address until morning.

839
00:48:37,818 --> 00:48:40,327
I have carefully read
the last will and testament...

840
00:48:40,352 --> 00:48:42,035
of the deceased,
John Garrison.

841
00:48:42,365 --> 00:48:44,759
I find nothing therein
to prevent the sale...

842
00:48:44,784 --> 00:48:47,400
of the publication enterprises
known as The Day.

843
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:50,958
Your honor, Mrs. Garrison, wife of
the deceased and one of the heirs,

844
00:48:50,983 --> 00:48:54,085
Would like to address
the court. Mrs. Garrison?

845
00:48:55,637 --> 00:48:58,508
Sir, I object to the sale
of this paper to Mr. White.

846
00:48:58,576 --> 00:49:01,155
Your honor,
Mrs. Garrison has agreed...

847
00:49:01,202 --> 00:49:04,641
But this request for sale was
signed by you, Mrs. Garrison.

848
00:49:04,709 --> 00:49:06,622
I've changed my mind.

849
00:49:06,647 --> 00:49:08,946
Mrs. Garrison's daughters have
not, and they constitute a majority.

850
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:12,339
My husband would not have wished for
this paper to be sold to Mr. White.

851
00:49:12,497 --> 00:49:15,448
- How do you know?
- Your honor, I object to cross-Examination...

852
00:49:15,473 --> 00:49:17,757
until the witness
has completed her statement.

853
00:49:17,951 --> 00:49:20,196
You knew the paper
was being sold to Mr. White.

854
00:49:20,268 --> 00:49:23,089
But I did not know it was going
to be rubbed out of existence,

855
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:26,034
Which it will be if
this contract is approved.

856
00:49:26,059 --> 00:49:30,318
What happens to this newspaper after it has
been sold is of absolutely no concern here.

857
00:49:30,432 --> 00:49:32,560
Is Mr. Crane the lawyer
and the judge?

858
00:49:32,585 --> 00:49:35,551
This Is a cheap display of
sensationalism and conspiracy.

859
00:49:35,657 --> 00:49:38,691
- Would the other heirs care to reconsider?
- No, sir.

860
00:49:38,859 --> 00:49:41,100
Would it be all right,
Mr. Crane,

861
00:49:41,298 --> 00:49:43,425
If they answered
for themselves?

862
00:49:46,407 --> 00:49:49,534
Mrs. Alice Garrison Courtney.

863
00:49:49,837 --> 00:49:53,056
Do you still wish to sell?
Yes, sir.

864
00:49:53,765 --> 00:49:57,593
Mrs. Katherine Garrison Geary.

865
00:49:58,291 --> 00:50:00,211
Yes, sir.

866
00:50:02,157 --> 00:50:04,627
In that case,
the paper may be sold.

867
00:50:04,677 --> 00:50:07,066
- Then I'll buy it.
- A contract already exists.

868
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:09,673
But, your honor, Mrs. Garrison
has priority of purchase.

869
00:50:09,804 --> 00:50:11,532
I'll raise Mr. White's offer.

870
00:50:11,556 --> 00:50:13,539
Your honor,
I cannot see that my client's interests...

871
00:50:13,564 --> 00:50:16,137
I don't see why you should object
to my daughters receiving more money.

872
00:50:16,161 --> 00:50:18,095
That's what they're selling
out for, isn't it? Money?

873
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,385
Will the counsel
kindly step up here?

874
00:50:23,514 --> 00:50:27,370
You can't do this. I can,
I want to, and I'm going to.

875
00:50:27,395 --> 00:50:28,617
What good will it do?

876
00:50:29,018 --> 00:50:31,738
You'll be happy to know that
stupidity is not hereditary.

877
00:50:31,796 --> 00:50:33,435
You've acquired it
all by yourselves.

878
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:35,542
You're making us
sound like fools.

879
00:50:35,648 --> 00:50:38,344
Well...
What changed your mind?

880
00:50:38,634 --> 00:50:41,215
Have you seen today's paper,
and yesterday's?

881
00:50:41,612 --> 00:50:43,417
Loyalty changed my mind,

882
00:50:43,441 --> 00:50:46,475
a principle evidently lacking in
the present generation.

883
00:50:46,886 --> 00:50:48,738
You haven't got the money
to buy the paper.

884
00:50:48,763 --> 00:50:51,149
- I'll get it.
- You're crazy.

885
00:50:51,894 --> 00:50:56,625
No, just ashamed. Ashamed for me,
for you and for your father.

886
00:50:57,068 --> 00:50:59,510
I'm not going
to let this paper die.

887
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:04,012
If that makes me crazy,
I'm good and crazy.

888
00:51:04,467 --> 00:51:05,797
All right?

889
00:51:08,485 --> 00:51:12,678
I should have required time to
consider Mrs. Garrison's request.

890
00:51:13,051 --> 00:51:16,144
Counsel will be notified
when this court will reconvene.

891
00:51:16,169 --> 00:51:18,171
Sir?
Mr. White?

892
00:51:18,333 --> 00:51:22,107
Any delay, even 24 hours,
will wreck the value of The Day.

893
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:26,004
People will not buy a dying
paper nor advertise in it.

894
00:51:26,114 --> 00:51:28,844
Now the staff of The Day
will become demoralized.

895
00:51:28,962 --> 00:51:31,760
No newspaper can function
under this handicap.

896
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,067
Thank you, Mr. White.

897
00:51:34,181 --> 00:51:37,267
However,
I must preserve decision.

898
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:43,310
But... if the current high standard
of journalism in The Day slackens,

899
00:51:43,577 --> 00:51:47,676
Or any act of neglect threatens
the well-Being of this newspaper,

900
00:51:47,882 --> 00:51:50,623
I shall be forced
to make an immediate decision...

901
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:52,768
based upon the current contract.

902
00:51:58,536 --> 00:52:00,766
- Mr. Hutcheson? My name is Hansen.
- Yes?

903
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,543
I'm, uh, Mr. Rienzi's lawyer.
He's waiting to see you in his car.

904
00:52:04,715 --> 00:52:06,501
- Why?
- It's personal business.

905
00:52:07,738 --> 00:52:10,263
- A ride?
- No, sir. A drive.

906
00:52:17,594 --> 00:52:19,403
How do you do,
Mr. Hutcheson?

907
00:52:25,946 --> 00:52:28,493
- I give you a lift someplace?
- Why?

908
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:32,521
- I'm a sociable type.
- They're expecting me at my office.

909
00:52:33,844 --> 00:52:36,536
- Okay, lippy.
- Okay, what?

910
00:52:36,857 --> 00:52:38,232
Just okay.

911
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:40,827
I wondered when and
how you'd get around to this.

912
00:52:40,852 --> 00:52:41,912
Yeah?

913
00:52:41,936 --> 00:52:44,271
Yeah. I expected
something a little more poetic.

914
00:52:45,382 --> 00:52:46,486
Drink?

915
00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:50,235
- Now that's rather poetic.
- What'll it be?

916
00:52:50,344 --> 00:52:52,720
- Nothing.
- Not a drinkin' man?

917
00:52:52,828 --> 00:52:55,058
No, not in an armored car.

918
00:52:56,005 --> 00:52:58,508
- I think I like you.
- Why?

919
00:52:58,578 --> 00:53:01,888
Imagination. I like a man
with imagination.

920
00:53:01,958 --> 00:53:03,903
You're a good newspaperman,
they say.

921
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,848
You're not bad
at your trade either.

922
00:53:05,931 --> 00:53:08,993
You got two Pulitzer prizes,
they say. Are they worth much?

923
00:53:09,128 --> 00:53:11,710
In cash, about $500 a piece.

924
00:53:11,786 --> 00:53:14,755
- Your kind of imagination is worth more.
- I agree.

925
00:53:15,213 --> 00:53:18,343
- But you're a hothead, they say.
- Who's "they"?

926
00:53:18,453 --> 00:53:22,089
Friends.
I got friends everywhere.

927
00:53:22,694 --> 00:53:24,395
I'd like for you
to be my friend.

928
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:26,365
I got a friend.
Not like me.

929
00:53:26,681 --> 00:53:28,736
Is that a proposal
or a proposition?

930
00:53:29,404 --> 00:53:32,724
What do you got against me?
You're not my type.

931
00:53:32,893 --> 00:53:36,423
You ever meet me before,
do business with me?

932
00:53:36,852 --> 00:53:38,729
Well, maybe you got
the wrong impression of me.

933
00:53:38,754 --> 00:53:41,006
What kind of an impression
would you like me to have?

934
00:53:44,002 --> 00:53:46,155
My family reads the paper.

935
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,293
It's not nice,
what you print.

936
00:53:49,673 --> 00:53:53,848
I got a nice family. Sometime
I'd like for you to meet them.

937
00:53:53,918 --> 00:53:57,628
No point in that, unless they're
the ones that almost killed Burrows.

938
00:53:57,742 --> 00:54:00,970
- Burrows?
- Never beat up a reporter, they say.

939
00:54:00,995 --> 00:54:03,342
It's like killin' a cop
on duty, they say.

940
00:54:03,748 --> 00:54:07,297
Never drop girls in the river,
clothed or unclothed, they say.

941
00:54:07,404 --> 00:54:09,781
What have I got to do
with reporters, or girls?

942
00:54:09,849 --> 00:54:13,444
- I'm in the cement and contractin' business.
- Capone was in insurance.

943
00:54:13,552 --> 00:54:16,231
- You got a sense of humor, friend.
- Then why don't you laugh?

944
00:54:16,255 --> 00:54:19,544
- Very funny.
- Tomorrow's newspaper will be even funnier.

945
00:54:23,442 --> 00:54:27,064
Ah. That's the Rienzi
I like to see.

946
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:28,778
This where you start shooting?

947
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:30,894
What are you supposed to be,
a little tin god?

948
00:54:31,025 --> 00:54:33,387
You gonna save the world?
A hero or somethin'?

949
00:54:33,829 --> 00:54:36,798
There's only one kind
dead ones.

950
00:54:37,024 --> 00:54:39,840
Show me a martyr, I'll lay you
4-to-1 he winds up out of the money.

951
00:54:40,327 --> 00:54:42,767
My lawyer says
I could sue you for this.

952
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:44,190
Well?

953
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:47,149
What you're tryin' to
do has been tried before.

954
00:54:47,264 --> 00:54:49,314
Nobody could ever make it stick.

955
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:52,454
In that case, you got
nothing to worry about.

956
00:55:00,065 --> 00:55:03,342
Thanks for the lift.
I can't say I enjoyed it.

957
00:55:03,367 --> 00:55:06,468
Cops, tax collectors,
politicians, citizens' committees...

958
00:55:06,493 --> 00:55:08,817
They all got an angle.
What's yours? Name it.

959
00:55:08,842 --> 00:55:11,690
What do you want?
My prizes are worth more than Pulitzer.

960
00:55:11,715 --> 00:55:15,003
I know. I got a look
at Sally's fur coat.

961
00:55:20,547 --> 00:55:23,050
Wasn't that Herman Schmidt
just went in?

962
00:55:23,161 --> 00:55:24,546
Yeah.

963
00:55:34,478 --> 00:55:37,747
Okay, from the beginning.

964
00:55:37,772 --> 00:55:39,227
First, let's see the money.

965
00:55:40,429 --> 00:55:42,476
He said you'd pay
for the story.

966
00:55:44,815 --> 00:55:46,646
Five grand.

967
00:55:49,566 --> 00:55:52,024
$1,000.
How far would that get me?

968
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:55,588
Out of the country, after you
testify against Rienzi. Yes or no?

969
00:55:56,192 --> 00:55:57,781
Well,
he said you'd protect me.

970
00:55:57,805 --> 00:56:00,765
These days,
accommodations in jail are hard to get.

971
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:03,134
However, I'll use my influence.

972
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:07,673
Well?
All right.

973
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:11,613
Get some sleep, and on your way
out, have 'em send in $1,000.

974
00:56:11,686 --> 00:56:13,993
- In cash!
- In cash.

975
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:19,418
Okay, you got the floor.

976
00:56:23,523 --> 00:56:27,448
- Where do you want me to start?
- Sally and Rienzi.

977
00:56:28,054 --> 00:56:29,570
Well, they liked each other.

978
00:56:29,595 --> 00:56:32,268
- Liked?
- Well, you know.

979
00:56:32,462 --> 00:56:36,159
- Rienzi pay her bills?
- What else?

980
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:39,797
- For everything?
- She was worth it.

981
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,134
That's what I like,
family pride.

982
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:44,172
Larry Hansen kicked in for the apartment,

983
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:47,782
Her fur coat, some cheap
jewelry, maybe her car too.

984
00:56:48,442 --> 00:56:52,977
But Sally bought $40,000 worth
of government bonds in her name.

985
00:56:53,255 --> 00:56:55,166
Rienzi pay for that?

986
00:56:56,135 --> 00:56:58,604
- I guess so.
- You're a liar.

987
00:56:58,897 --> 00:57:02,019
Sally used the $200,000
Rienzi gave her to hold for him.

988
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:03,831
What $200,000?

989
00:57:03,896 --> 00:57:05,477
Why would a guy
part with that kind of scratch?

990
00:57:05,501 --> 00:57:06,506
Hot money.

991
00:57:06,531 --> 00:57:08,628
The City Bank says your
sister rented a safety deposit box.

992
00:57:08,652 --> 00:57:09,816
She gave it up a month ago.

993
00:57:09,841 --> 00:57:11,309
On the same day she
moved out of her apartment.

994
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:12,401
Why?

995
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:18,033
All right. It's true. He gave
her the money to keep for him.

996
00:57:18,558 --> 00:57:21,473
When he wanted it back, she
was scared he'd make a break.

997
00:57:21,927 --> 00:57:23,920
She said as long as she
kept the cash...

998
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:25,790
He'd stick.

999
00:57:28,297 --> 00:57:30,174
Didn't work out that way.

1000
00:57:33,639 --> 00:57:35,069
I don't feel so good.

1001
00:57:42,507 --> 00:57:43,925
Have this type,
more coming.

1002
00:57:43,949 --> 00:57:46,034
Yes, Mrs. Garrison
wants to see you in the dome.

1003
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:48,106
- Well, stall her.
- Here's that $1,000 you wanted.

1004
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,422
Uh-huh.

1005
00:57:51,536 --> 00:57:53,760
- Uh, Hal, get your camera in there.
- Yes, sir.

1006
00:57:53,784 --> 00:57:55,911
- What did you say?
- Are you married, honey?

1007
00:57:55,985 --> 00:57:58,249
- Cleary...
- Later, baby.

1008
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:01,681
Get hold of the governor. Ask him if
he'll appoint a special grand jury...

1009
00:58:01,706 --> 00:58:03,210
to investigate
the last election.

1010
00:58:03,317 --> 00:58:04,928
Some of the names
that'll come up...

1011
00:58:05,172 --> 00:58:06,779
We supported a few for office.

1012
00:58:06,804 --> 00:58:10,543
A newspaper has no political party, we
support men for office, some good, some bad.

1013
00:58:10,567 --> 00:58:12,572
Mr. Hutcheson,
Mrs. Willebrandt's on here.

1014
00:58:13,049 --> 00:58:16,572
If the governor won't act, uh, get the
chairman of the state senate committee.

1015
00:58:17,275 --> 00:58:19,471
Yes? Hutcheson.

1016
00:58:21,262 --> 00:58:22,715
Oh, hold it.

1017
00:58:22,995 --> 00:58:24,683
Uh, go ahead, Willebrandt.

1018
00:58:26,523 --> 00:58:28,730
Sally? What about her?

1019
00:58:30,268 --> 00:58:33,772
Where'd she move to?
What hotel?

1020
00:58:34,541 --> 00:58:36,243
When did you find out
Sally was dead?

1021
00:58:36,268 --> 00:58:38,366
Well, I... I read
about it in the paper.

1022
00:58:38,391 --> 00:58:40,230
She was dead three days
before the papers got it.

1023
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,458
Your mother says you left the house
last Saturday and didn't come back.

1024
00:58:42,482 --> 00:58:43,671
Sally was killed that same night.

1025
00:58:43,695 --> 00:58:46,172
So what? I leave the house
lots of times, for weeks sometimes.

1026
00:58:46,197 --> 00:58:47,207
But not to hide out.

1027
00:58:47,337 --> 00:58:49,032
You were afraid of Rienzi.
Why?

1028
00:58:49,197 --> 00:58:50,889
You knew he was going
to Sally's place last Saturday.

1029
00:58:50,913 --> 00:58:54,361
- I didn't even know where she lived.
- Hold it. Shoot.

1030
00:58:56,458 --> 00:58:59,324
Sally was moved from
her apartment on Maple Avenue...

1031
00:58:59,607 --> 00:59:02,336
by the Intercity Storage Company
four weeks ago...

1032
00:59:02,605 --> 00:59:06,650
to the Leroy Hotel, registered under
the name of Bessie Schmidt.

1033
00:59:07,027 --> 00:59:10,770
Never left her room. She had only
two visitors, your mother and you.

1034
00:59:10,837 --> 00:59:12,955
You were there Saturday night.

1035
00:59:13,366 --> 00:59:16,108
- I don't remember, maybe I was.
- Why did you go there?

1036
00:59:16,162 --> 00:59:17,717
Well, I, uh...

1037
00:59:19,793 --> 00:59:22,806
She phoned me. Yeah,
that's right. She phoned me!

1038
00:59:22,831 --> 00:59:26,188
The desk clerk says you
phoned her from the desk, 1:30 AM.

1039
00:59:26,212 --> 00:59:27,652
He could be wrong!

1040
00:59:30,419 --> 00:59:33,022
Yeah. That's right.

1041
00:59:33,307 --> 00:59:36,362
Somewhere out there,
Rienzi is waiting for you.

1042
00:59:37,409 --> 00:59:40,697
Either you tell the truth or I'll turn
you loose, no money no protection.

1043
00:59:43,865 --> 00:59:45,264
Okay.

1044
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:48,307
- Throw him out.
- Wait.

1045
00:59:50,974 --> 00:59:52,798
Rienzi wanted his money.

1046
00:59:53,737 --> 00:59:55,498
They couldn't find out
where she was living.

1047
00:59:55,548 --> 00:59:57,557
- So you showed them.
- Why you do it?

1048
00:59:57,595 --> 01:00:00,689
- What Rienzi promise?
- Well, he got me my job.

1049
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:03,351
I owed him some money.
I couldn't pay him.

1050
01:00:04,165 --> 01:00:06,161
He said the favor
would square us.

1051
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:09,278
All you had to do was put
the finger on your own sister.

1052
01:00:09,391 --> 01:00:11,951
I didn't know what they
were gonna do. I swear it.

1053
01:00:12,061 --> 01:00:13,961
- Who went with you, Rienzi?
- I went alone.

1054
01:00:13,986 --> 01:00:16,600
- So she wouldn't be afraid to let you in.
- They came later.

1055
01:00:16,924 --> 01:00:18,947
All you did was open
the door for them. That's all.

1056
01:00:18,971 --> 01:00:19,997
Who's "they"?

1057
01:00:20,031 --> 01:00:23,240
- Lefty Smith, Whitey Franks and Kid Jones.
- They belong to Rienzi?

1058
01:00:23,264 --> 01:00:25,846
- Except Whitey. He hires out.
- You let them in, then what?

1059
01:00:26,362 --> 01:00:28,916
Well, they asked her
for the money.

1060
01:00:29,338 --> 01:00:33,411
She wouldn't give,
so Whitey, he hit her.

1061
01:00:34,194 --> 01:00:37,311
Then Lefty,
she began to scream.

1062
01:00:37,726 --> 01:00:39,512
She hollered for me
to help her.

1063
01:00:41,418 --> 01:00:45,252
Then whitey, he shut her up.

1064
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:50,497
I got scared. I couldn't watch what
they were doing I ran into the bathroom.

1065
01:00:52,088 --> 01:00:53,471
I beat it out of there.

1066
01:00:54,349 --> 01:00:56,362
That's all I know. Honest.

1067
01:00:56,387 --> 01:00:57,555
Yes?

1068
01:00:57,579 --> 01:00:59,907
Mrs. Garrison's still
waiting, What do I tell her?

1069
01:01:00,105 --> 01:01:01,857
I'll be right up.

1070
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:04,982
The word was out
Rienzi wanted me.

1071
01:01:05,934 --> 01:01:07,845
They was afraid
I was gonna sing.

1072
01:01:08,241 --> 01:01:10,194
If I stay for the trial,
they'll get to me.

1073
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,525
You don't know them.

1074
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:14,282
- In jail, no matter where...
- Soon as that's type, have him sign it.

1075
01:01:14,307 --> 01:01:16,265
We won't have time
to get this all in the bulldog.

1076
01:01:16,290 --> 01:01:18,014
We'll get the text of the
statement in the second edition.

1077
01:01:18,038 --> 01:01:20,053
Count it. Count it!

1078
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:22,933
And have this office fumigated.

1079
01:01:31,923 --> 01:01:34,379
- Mr. Hutcheson? About Lewis Shafer
- Oh, yeah.

1080
01:01:34,404 --> 01:01:36,440
Uh, that information
you requested.

1081
01:01:36,478 --> 01:01:39,013
Uh, Lewis Shafer, age 42,
born in Baltimore,

1082
01:01:39,038 --> 01:01:41,871
Only child of John and Harriet
Shafer of the chemical fortune.

1083
01:01:42,997 --> 01:01:44,996
- Was he ever married before?
- No, sir.

1084
01:01:45,072 --> 01:01:48,875
- Ever get pinched? Was he ever arrested?
- No record, if he was.

1085
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,084
Alcoholic? Swindler?

1086
01:01:51,804 --> 01:01:54,310
Maybe he's a fiend.
You know, he looked like one.

1087
01:01:54,846 --> 01:01:57,462
Check his army record?
Maybe he's a spy.

1088
01:01:57,536 --> 01:01:59,665
Got the silver star
and the purple heart.

1089
01:02:00,983 --> 01:02:03,894
- That's a rotten report.
- Yes, sir.

1090
01:02:04,048 --> 01:02:06,219
Eddie, two things.

1091
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:08,181
Rienzi's started his libel suit.

1092
01:02:08,205 --> 01:02:10,119
We were served with
the papers half an hour ago.

1093
01:02:10,262 --> 01:02:11,270
Second?

1094
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:13,816
Judge McKay is going to
hand down a decision tonight at 9:00.

1095
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:16,004
Because of the libel suit?
We'll be ready for him.

1096
01:02:16,028 --> 01:02:17,080
And another thing,

1097
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:19,940
That one percent you were
promised when we sold the paper...

1098
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:22,056
Well, Alice and Kitty
have withdrawn it.

1099
01:02:22,189 --> 01:02:24,187
What took 'em so long?
Uh-huh.

1100
01:02:24,254 --> 01:02:26,234
You were wonderful today, baby.

1101
01:02:26,267 --> 01:02:28,046
Oh. Mr. Blake and Mr. Green,
this is Mr. Hutcheson.

1102
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:29,633
How do you do?
How do you do, sir?

1103
01:02:29,658 --> 01:02:34,235
Their banking firm has offered to lend us
the extra money to meet Mr. White's offer.

1104
01:02:34,304 --> 01:02:36,750
- Pending a few facts, of course.
- Of course.

1105
01:02:36,943 --> 01:02:40,001
Try to remember Rienzi's exact
words when he asked you...

1106
01:02:40,026 --> 01:02:42,197
to bring the three hoods
to Sally's hotel room.

1107
01:02:42,437 --> 01:02:43,665
We can get that...

1108
01:02:44,258 --> 01:02:46,281
Got a warrant here
for Herman Schmidt.

1109
01:02:47,379 --> 01:02:50,450
We're not finished yet. We want him to sign
the statement. It'll only take a few minutes.

1110
01:02:50,474 --> 01:02:52,535
Come along, Schmidt.
You got no right to take statements.

1111
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,643
As long as it's not a
police state, we have. Sorry.

1112
01:02:58,244 --> 01:03:00,061
- Whitey!
- Shut up.

1113
01:03:00,823 --> 01:03:02,542
Take him out the back way.

1114
01:03:02,885 --> 01:03:04,677
I didn't tell him anythi...

1115
01:03:07,552 --> 01:03:09,725
Whitey, I didn't
tell him anything.

1116
01:03:11,649 --> 01:03:14,253
And that doesn't include
the higher cost of newsprint.

1117
01:03:14,393 --> 01:03:15,448
How's that?

1118
01:03:15,472 --> 01:03:20,587
It keeps going up, right now it's $110
a ton, in 1942 it was $50 a ton.

1119
01:03:20,647 --> 01:03:24,346
Takes talent to get the news, think it through,
write it and back it up with research.

1120
01:03:24,628 --> 01:03:26,953
Without good reporting,
you haven't got a paper.

1121
01:03:27,211 --> 01:03:30,337
- That extra four percent...
- Might make it dangerous venture.

1122
01:03:31,212 --> 01:03:34,590
A free press, sir, like a
free life, is always in danger.

1123
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:39,305
That's why I hid out, 'cause
I knew somebody would get me.

1124
01:03:39,376 --> 01:03:41,833
- Listen. You got to believe me.
- Ah, shut up.

1125
01:03:41,905 --> 01:03:43,338
You do believe me,
don't you?

1126
01:04:19,129 --> 01:04:20,762
I like the proposition.

1127
01:04:20,835 --> 01:04:24,259
- Barring unforeseen complications I think...
- Ed, it's for you.

1128
01:04:26,149 --> 01:04:27,348
Yeah?

1129
01:04:50,918 --> 01:04:53,603
Give him a description of what
that so-called police look like.

1130
01:04:53,628 --> 01:04:55,049
Yes, Captain.

1131
01:04:56,686 --> 01:04:59,366
When's the press gonna grow up
and stop playing detective?

1132
01:04:59,951 --> 01:05:02,063
Can't you tell the difference
between a hoodlum and a cop?

1133
01:05:02,088 --> 01:05:04,538
In this town? Yes, sir.

1134
01:05:04,664 --> 01:05:05,810
Captain.

1135
01:05:08,666 --> 01:05:09,937
Got the address?

1136
01:05:10,788 --> 01:05:12,665
Now see that Mrs. Garrison
gets home all right.

1137
01:05:12,764 --> 01:05:14,549
What about Schmidt's confession?
We run anyway?

1138
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:18,685
Without his signature? That
judge would surely close us down.

1139
01:05:20,603 --> 01:05:22,234
You made a mess of it.

1140
01:05:22,992 --> 01:05:25,058
I told you
I don't want no violence.

1141
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:26,923
Not yet, anyway.

1142
01:05:27,026 --> 01:05:30,766
There's a time and place for this
kind of thing. This is stupid.

1143
01:05:32,782 --> 01:05:36,522
No. No.
Run away from what?

1144
01:05:36,673 --> 01:05:39,221
I'll talk to them
myself, personally.

1145
01:05:39,422 --> 01:05:41,975
Get 'em down here
to my office, all of 'em.

1146
01:05:42,474 --> 01:05:45,867
Sure, now. Right now.
You too.

1147
01:05:46,307 --> 01:05:49,799
And find Sally's old lady, Mrs. Schmidt.
Bring her in. I wanna talk to her.

1148
01:05:49,956 --> 01:05:52,470
And this time,
don't foul it up.

1149
01:05:56,702 --> 01:06:00,274
No paper ever did a better,
faster, more thorough job.

1150
01:06:00,491 --> 01:06:04,054
All we needed was that one
bit of evidence, and we had it.

1151
01:06:05,216 --> 01:06:08,113
Why do you think we hung the
whole thing on Rienzi's case?

1152
01:06:08,815 --> 01:06:12,200
Because we were sentimental about
a dead girl and a mink coat? No.

1153
01:06:12,307 --> 01:06:16,242
No, we had something big,
big enough to save our necks.

1154
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:20,432
Rienzi in the liquor business,
the financial department dug that one up.

1155
01:06:20,764 --> 01:06:23,010
Distributed for two of the
biggest name brands.

1156
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:26,314
Rienzi's brother runs
a wire service for race results,

1157
01:06:26,339 --> 01:06:31,580
Transportation, a loan agency for
bookies, real estate, hotels, nightclubs.

1158
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:34,349
Slot machines,
et cetera, et cetera.

1159
01:06:34,564 --> 01:06:39,831
Years ago, my husband tried to do a
story like this on a man just like Rienzi.

1160
01:06:39,904 --> 01:06:43,442
No, I figured with a story like this
to tell, they'd never close us down.

1161
01:06:44,701 --> 01:06:46,901
Well...

1162
01:06:47,395 --> 01:06:49,906
We showed 'em how a real
newspaper can function.

1163
01:06:50,218 --> 01:06:53,006
And now,
we're licked, baby.

1164
01:06:53,534 --> 01:06:55,320
Put a head on this,
will you?

1165
01:06:58,168 --> 01:07:02,878
My husband always said if it was a
worthwhile fight, didn't matter who won.

1166
01:07:03,128 --> 01:07:05,164
Some good was sure
to come out of it.

1167
01:07:08,076 --> 01:07:10,465
That Rienzi's wine?

1168
01:07:10,701 --> 01:07:13,761
- Pretty good.
- The best.

1169
01:07:14,938 --> 01:07:17,736
- Well, you're quite a girl.
- Yeah.

1170
01:07:18,745 --> 01:07:20,620
Guess they made 'em different
in your day.

1171
01:07:20,654 --> 01:07:23,065
- Yeah.
- More durable.

1172
01:07:23,457 --> 01:07:25,200
More pliable.

1173
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:30,494
Girls these days have stuff, but
they're... brittle, break more easily,

1174
01:07:30,654 --> 01:07:32,310
Don't roll with the punches.

1175
01:07:32,679 --> 01:07:35,193
Plenty of gall
and no guts.

1176
01:07:36,743 --> 01:07:39,856
- Meaning Nora?
- Uh, meaning Nora.

1177
01:07:40,250 --> 01:07:44,297
There will now be a respectful silence
while we feel sorry for ourselves.

1178
01:07:45,727 --> 01:07:48,571
- Well, she had no right to walk out on me.
- Why not?

1179
01:07:48,878 --> 01:07:51,690
- Well, because...
- Because it inconvenienced you.

1180
01:07:51,744 --> 01:07:53,364
Because she's my wife.

1181
01:07:53,576 --> 01:07:58,081
You wouldn't have had a wife
if that newspaper had beautiful legs.

1182
01:07:59,432 --> 01:08:01,199
Sure, sure.

1183
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:04,908
- You never walked out on John.
- Who said so? Twice.

1184
01:08:05,004 --> 01:08:07,040
- You must've had a pretty good reason.
- The best.

1185
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:10,676
The bride always likes to think
she's indispensable,

1186
01:08:11,459 --> 01:08:12,926
Even in the morning.

1187
01:08:13,188 --> 01:08:15,336
1 woke up, and he was gone.

1188
01:08:15,556 --> 01:08:19,219
Gone back to the paper,
to do the Lusitania story.

1189
01:08:19,549 --> 01:08:21,801
- I walked out.
- Ah, but you came back.

1190
01:08:22,259 --> 01:08:25,698
Two days later. He didn't
even know I'd been gone.

1191
01:08:26,533 --> 01:08:29,633
- But he loved you.
- Passionately, between editions.

1192
01:08:30,161 --> 01:08:35,162
He had time to change the face
of journalism, fight for reform,

1193
01:08:35,302 --> 01:08:39,127
And crusade for a thousand lost causes,
but he had no time for his family.

1194
01:08:39,197 --> 01:08:43,418
So I took my two daughters and
left this big, beautiful mausoleum.

1195
01:08:43,529 --> 01:08:47,033
- Why did you come back?
- Well, we needed each other.

1196
01:08:47,106 --> 01:08:49,279
It was I who did
the adjusting, though.

1197
01:08:49,317 --> 01:08:52,420
It wasn't Alice or Kitty
or John.

1198
01:08:53,088 --> 01:08:55,913
He needed a son
to carry on the paper.

1199
01:08:56,298 --> 01:08:59,563
And they needed a father
to love, not a bulldog edition.

1200
01:08:59,632 --> 01:09:02,790
- Enter me.
- Spitting image.

1201
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:07,273
- And what did you want?
- To be useful.

1202
01:09:08,011 --> 01:09:09,235
Well-

1203
01:09:10,422 --> 01:09:12,076
To newspapers.

1204
01:09:12,242 --> 01:09:16,167
To editors like you,
a publisher's delight.

1205
01:09:19,741 --> 01:09:21,491
Don't blame Nora.

1206
01:09:21,961 --> 01:09:26,551
Unless she wants to come back,
it won't work, if she stays away...

1207
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,739
I can look for a newspaper
with nice legs.

1208
01:09:29,815 --> 01:09:33,197
Court convenes in about half an hour.
Are you going to be there?

1209
01:09:33,222 --> 01:09:34,612
Maybe.

1210
01:09:37,499 --> 01:09:40,049
- Will you marry me?
- You're too old.

1211
01:09:43,214 --> 01:09:45,522
- You go through old lady Schmidt's house?
- Top to bottom.

1212
01:09:45,547 --> 01:09:47,043
- Well?
- Nothing.

1213
01:09:47,556 --> 01:09:49,547
- Mrs. Schmidt, you find her?
- Not yet.

1214
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:52,042
- Got anybody at the house waiting for her?
- Inside and out.

1215
01:09:52,077 --> 01:09:53,650
Don't bring her here.

1216
01:09:54,096 --> 01:09:56,494
I don't want none of
your boys around here.

1217
01:09:56,622 --> 01:09:58,818
- Now or anytime. You understand?
- I understand.

1218
01:09:58,883 --> 01:10:02,940
And don't phone me,
here or at home, any of you!

1219
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:04,985
Would it be better
if we left town for a while?

1220
01:10:05,098 --> 01:10:06,100
We stay put.

1221
01:10:06,125 --> 01:10:08,286
- Suppose the grand jury indicts?
- Leave them indict.

1222
01:10:08,311 --> 01:10:10,848
- Larry'll take care of things.
- I'll try.

1223
01:10:10,939 --> 01:10:15,220
That's right. You'll try.
I don't want no panic...

1224
01:10:15,581 --> 01:10:18,717
if there's an investigation
or even a trial.

1225
01:10:19,101 --> 01:10:21,654
We been through this kind of thing
before. We're still in business.

1226
01:10:21,947 --> 01:10:24,825
Our story's printed
in the paper. So what?

1227
01:10:25,392 --> 01:10:27,429
Tomorrow, it's old news.
Next week, people forget.

1228
01:10:27,454 --> 01:10:29,688
- But if they keep printing?
- They won't.

1229
01:10:29,713 --> 01:10:32,450
But if they keep us in the news until
the trial, if they heat up the public...

1230
01:10:32,474 --> 01:10:34,862
You take care of your end.
I'll handle the paper.

1231
01:10:34,887 --> 01:10:37,329
- Hutcheson won't handle easily.
- He's got nothing.

1232
01:10:37,363 --> 01:10:38,953
With Schmidt out of the way,
what's he got?

1233
01:10:38,978 --> 01:10:40,963
- That won't stop him.
- And he won't stop us.

1234
01:10:42,704 --> 01:10:44,470
Tomorrow, he won't even
have a paper.

1235
01:10:44,575 --> 01:10:46,279
Courts'll take it
away from him.

1236
01:10:47,189 --> 01:10:51,300
And if they don't, we'll
take him away from the paper.

1237
01:10:51,763 --> 01:10:54,345
Maybe they all need
an example.

1238
01:10:54,591 --> 01:10:56,331
Yeah, that's what they need.

1239
01:11:01,409 --> 01:11:03,957
- You better find Hutcheson.
- You want to see him?

1240
01:11:04,267 --> 01:11:06,167
No.

1241
01:11:15,681 --> 01:11:18,108
Mrs. Garrison? How are you?

1242
01:11:24,632 --> 01:11:26,577
Please rise.

1243
01:11:33,591 --> 01:11:35,325
His honor,
the surrogate.

1244
01:11:35,498 --> 01:11:37,409
Please be seated.

1245
01:11:42,863 --> 01:11:45,047
I'm a little bit worried
about him.

1246
01:11:50,688 --> 01:11:54,411
Regarding the sale and purchase
of the publishing company...

1247
01:11:54,626 --> 01:11:56,961
herein referred to
as The Day...

1248
01:11:59,824 --> 01:12:03,479
I've made a careful study
of the existing contract...

1249
01:12:03,552 --> 01:12:05,900
between the heirs of
the late John Garrison

1250
01:12:06,078 --> 01:12:08,216
and Lawrence white
publishing enterprises.

1251
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:12,378
I can see no reason why this
contract should not be enforced.

1252
01:12:12,618 --> 01:12:18,007
Therefore, unless further evidence or
argument is presented to alter my judgment,

1253
01:12:18,427 --> 01:12:21,368
The court is prepared
to render its decision.

1254
01:12:22,136 --> 01:12:25,400
Mrs. Garrison,
do you have anything to add?

1255
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,393
Do you want to say anything?

1256
01:12:27,779 --> 01:12:29,441
No statement, your honor.

1257
01:12:29,913 --> 01:12:33,935
Your honor, before you
decide, may I say something?

1258
01:12:33,959 --> 01:12:37,466
If your honor please, I don't think
this gentleman is one of the heirs.

1259
01:12:37,491 --> 01:12:39,767
He's not here as amicus curiae,
and I'm...

1260
01:12:39,792 --> 01:12:42,339
positive he's not here in
the interests of Mr. White.

1261
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:44,792
Whom does he presume
to represent?

1262
01:12:45,115 --> 01:12:46,281
Well sir...

1263
01:12:46,733 --> 01:12:50,311
- I'm trying to save a newspaper.
- Which is not yours in the first place.

1264
01:12:50,336 --> 01:12:51,468
That is true.

1265
01:12:51,814 --> 01:12:54,489
The Day consists of a big building.
I don't own that.

1266
01:12:54,943 --> 01:12:59,937
It also consists of typewriters, teletypes,
presses, newsprint, ink and desks.

1267
01:13:00,118 --> 01:13:03,358
I don't own those either.
But this newspaper is more than that.

1268
01:13:03,459 --> 01:13:05,848
We're all aware
of what a newspaper consists.

1269
01:13:05,873 --> 01:13:07,750
I'm not so sure about that.

1270
01:13:09,386 --> 01:13:13,088
The Day is... more than a building.
It's people.

1271
01:13:13,828 --> 01:13:17,393
It's 1500 men and women whose skill,
heart, brains and experience...

1272
01:13:17,418 --> 01:13:19,190
make a great newspaper possible.

1273
01:13:19,407 --> 01:13:22,126
We don't own one stick
of furniture in this company.

1274
01:13:22,308 --> 01:13:26,187
But we, along with the 290,000
people who read this paper,

1275
01:13:26,478 --> 01:13:28,925
Have a vital interest
in whether it lives or dies.

1276
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:30,774
This is highly
irregular procedure.

1277
01:13:30,894 --> 01:13:32,679
So is the murder
of a newspaper!

1278
01:13:32,704 --> 01:13:34,501
Aren't you carrying this
a bit too far?

1279
01:13:34,526 --> 01:13:36,447
The death of a newspaper
sometimes has far reaching effects.

1280
01:13:36,471 --> 01:13:38,924
- Meaning your own pocketbook in this case.
- In this case,

1281
01:13:38,949 --> 01:13:40,985
Meaning some unfinished business
called Rienzi.

1282
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:42,944
If you read The Day,
you'd know what I mean.

1283
01:13:42,969 --> 01:13:45,968
- I don't care to discuss Mr. Rienzi.
- This newspaper does.

1284
01:13:45,993 --> 01:13:47,775
This doesn't concern us
here today.

1285
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,700
It concerns the public
every day.

1286
01:13:49,725 --> 01:13:53,317
A newspaper, as Mr. White will agree,
is published first, last and always...

1287
01:13:53,342 --> 01:13:54,564
in the public interest.

1288
01:13:54,589 --> 01:13:56,788
Yours is not
the only newspaper in town.

1289
01:13:56,813 --> 01:13:59,836
Right now, it's the only
newspaper willing to expose Rienzi.

1290
01:13:59,870 --> 01:14:02,293
- Your honor.
- An honest, fearless press...

1291
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,664
is the public's first protection
against gangsterism,

1292
01:14:04,689 --> 01:14:06,689
local or international.

1293
01:14:06,714 --> 01:14:10,768
Mr. Hutcheson, though
a surrogates court is informal,

1294
01:14:10,793 --> 01:14:12,996
there are certain rules
and procedure.

1295
01:14:13,021 --> 01:14:14,856
May we have
your decision now, sir?

1296
01:14:16,001 --> 01:14:20,256
As one of your 290,000 readers,
Mr. Hutcheson,

1297
01:14:20,404 --> 01:14:22,092
I rule that...

1298
01:14:22,442 --> 01:14:24,378
you may proceed
with your statement.

1299
01:14:24,829 --> 01:14:26,049
Thank you, sir.

1300
01:14:26,204 --> 01:14:30,186
But let's try to keep this from
becoming a personal matter, please.

1301
01:14:30,475 --> 01:14:32,909
Well, a newspaper's a very
personal matter, sir.

1302
01:14:33,058 --> 01:14:35,111
Ask the people
who let us in their homes.

1303
01:14:35,289 --> 01:14:38,415
I've read The Day
for more than 35 years.

1304
01:14:38,773 --> 01:14:41,146
Before that,
I sold it in the streets.

1305
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:42,959
However...

1306
01:14:43,133 --> 01:14:47,253
here we're only concerned with the legal
aspect of the sale and purchase of property.

1307
01:14:47,605 --> 01:14:49,994
What happens after
Mr. White takes possession...

1308
01:14:50,201 --> 01:14:52,482
Is outside of
the jurisdiction of this court.

1309
01:14:52,514 --> 01:14:54,052
Well, in whose
jurisdiction is it?

1310
01:14:54,077 --> 01:14:55,241
Just a moment.

1311
01:14:55,265 --> 01:14:58,502
Since when is it immoral for someone
to legally purchase a newspaper?

1312
01:14:58,792 --> 01:15:04,262
I don't care if Mr. White buys and runs
two papers or 20 papers or 100 papers.

1313
01:15:04,287 --> 01:15:07,036
Some of the best newspapers in
this country are part of a chain.

1314
01:15:07,223 --> 01:15:09,805
But I do care when he buys a
newspaper to put it out of business!

1315
01:15:12,668 --> 01:15:15,444
Because without competition, there
can be no freedom of the press.

1316
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:17,941
And I'm talking about
free enterprise, your honor,

1317
01:15:18,179 --> 01:15:22,552
The right of the public to a
marketplace of ideas, news and opinions.

1318
01:15:22,655 --> 01:15:26,222
Not of one man's or one leader's
or even one government's.

1319
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,804
I..

1320
01:15:29,629 --> 01:15:32,883
Well, I guess
that's all I have to say.

1321
01:15:35,465 --> 01:15:39,394
The existing contract is valid,
made in good faith.

1322
01:15:41,423 --> 01:15:43,795
As of tomorrow, November 14,

1323
01:15:43,955 --> 01:15:47,789
The Lawrence white publications
will assume control of The Day.

1324
01:15:48,007 --> 01:15:49,804
Court adjourned.

1325
01:15:54,087 --> 01:15:56,204
Well, thanks for trying.

1326
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:59,613
- There'll be another day. Goodbye, Ed.
- Goodbye.

1327
01:16:04,985 --> 01:16:07,218
Here you are, Mr. Hutcheson.
I have the city desk.

1328
01:16:08,001 --> 01:16:10,413
Frank? Here it is.

1329
01:16:10,598 --> 01:16:12,691
Lead-Off for
the morning edition.

1330
01:16:12,829 --> 01:16:17,447
<i>The day, after 47 years of daily
publication, was sold last night.</i>

1331
01:16:17,525 --> 01:16:19,385
Ed, get back here
as quick as you can.

1332
01:16:19,627 --> 01:16:21,504
Yeah, well give it to me
over the phone.

1333
01:16:25,393 --> 01:16:28,064
I'll be right there.
Five minutes.

1334
01:16:29,697 --> 01:16:32,272
Would you care to state who
killed your daughter, Mrs. Schmidt?

1335
01:16:32,459 --> 01:16:34,996
- Was it Rienzi?
- Some of his men?

1336
01:16:35,545 --> 01:16:37,593
I come to see boss.

1337
01:16:37,663 --> 01:16:39,982
Did you know your son
was working for Rienzi?

1338
01:16:40,785 --> 01:16:42,267
Was that hutch?

1339
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:45,824
Do you think
we ought to call the police?

1340
01:16:46,616 --> 01:16:48,550
I'm worried about her.

1341
01:16:52,288 --> 01:16:55,598
Paper's been sold.
Write a new lead.

1342
01:17:22,538 --> 01:17:23,980
Coffee.

1343
01:17:25,161 --> 01:17:27,603
Have you been to
your home yet, Mrs. Schmidt?

1344
01:17:28,945 --> 01:17:32,369
- Where have you been?
- I speak to boss.

1345
01:17:38,274 --> 01:17:41,739
Mrs. Schmidt wandered in,
on her own, looking for you.

1346
01:17:41,764 --> 01:17:43,575
Won't talk to anyone else.

1347
01:17:44,207 --> 01:17:46,457
Mrs. Schmidt, the boss.

1348
01:17:46,563 --> 01:17:48,051
How do you do, Mrs. Schmidt?

1349
01:17:48,475 --> 01:17:50,633
- Your name, please?
- Hutcheson.

1350
01:17:51,355 --> 01:17:53,209
I am mother to Bessie.

1351
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:59,353
Oh, uh, about your son-
I'm very sorry.

1352
01:17:59,564 --> 01:18:01,079
I do not come for that.

1353
01:18:08,634 --> 01:18:10,443
Sit down, please.

1354
01:18:11,922 --> 01:18:13,051
Here.

1355
01:18:14,768 --> 01:18:18,557
My Bessie, she comes to me
and she says,

1356
01:18:19,218 --> 01:18:21,921
<i>Here, mama. You keep this.</i>

1357
01:18:22,451 --> 01:18:26,385
Something happens to me,
you do not have to worry."

1358
01:18:28,015 --> 01:18:29,926
This is Bessie's diary?

1359
01:18:29,998 --> 01:18:35,345
She says what happens to her
and this Mr. Rienzi.

1360
01:18:39,636 --> 01:18:42,833
- Yes, sir?
- Get Captain Finlay over here right away.

1361
01:18:42,940 --> 01:18:45,935
And tell Allen we're getting
out the final edition as usual.

1362
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:47,730
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

1363
01:18:49,905 --> 01:18:51,591
Why didn't you go
to the police, Mrs. Schmidt?

1364
01:18:52,530 --> 01:18:55,814
Police?
I do not know police.

1365
01:18:56,497 --> 01:18:59,884
I know newspaper.
This newspaper.

1366
01:19:00,464 --> 01:19:03,604
For 31 years,
I know this paper.

1367
01:19:04,157 --> 01:19:07,614
I come to America.
I wish to be good citizen.

1368
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:10,810
How to do this?
From newspaper.

1369
01:19:11,266 --> 01:19:13,550
It shows me
how to read and write.

1370
01:19:14,655 --> 01:19:18,916
My Bessie dies, you do not say
bad things of her.

1371
01:19:19,508 --> 01:19:21,939
You do not show
bad pictures of her.

1372
01:19:22,695 --> 01:19:27,507
You try to find...
who hurt my Bessie.

1373
01:19:28,522 --> 01:19:30,890
Good. I help.

1374
01:19:31,348 --> 01:19:34,663
I think what to do.
I go on subway.

1375
01:19:34,914 --> 01:19:39,250
I ride all day.
I think. I come.

1376
01:19:40,851 --> 01:19:44,196
By doing this, you may be
in danger, like your son.

1377
01:19:44,852 --> 01:19:46,518
You are not afraid.

1378
01:19:47,645 --> 01:19:49,454
Your paper's not afraid.

1379
01:19:50,583 --> 01:19:52,471
I am not afraid.

1380
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:08,052
Hello, Mrs. Hutcheson.
Or is it... Mrs. Shafer now?

1381
01:20:08,256 --> 01:20:10,019
- Where is he?
- In the press room.

1382
01:20:12,536 --> 01:20:14,925
- Has he lost the paper yet?
- Yes.

1383
01:20:15,061 --> 01:20:16,518
What's he gonna do?

1384
01:20:16,808 --> 01:20:20,380
Get out the last edition, and
it ought to be quite a paper.

1385
01:20:20,711 --> 01:20:23,743
- But then what?
- Look for another job, I guess.

1386
01:20:24,072 --> 01:20:25,944
Is it Mrs. Shafer?

1387
01:20:26,976 --> 01:20:28,388
No.

1388
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:32,882
Hello, Alex.

1389
01:20:32,906 --> 01:20:34,528
- This is it, eh?
- Yeah.

1390
01:20:34,673 --> 01:20:35,935
Looks like our last one.

1391
01:20:49,756 --> 01:20:51,277
Phone, Mr. Hutcheson.

1392
01:20:58,958 --> 01:21:01,932
Yes? Who?

1393
01:21:03,956 --> 01:21:05,591
Well, put the call through.

1394
01:21:11,711 --> 01:21:14,621
- Hutcheson?
- Hello, baby.

1395
01:21:16,033 --> 01:21:20,311
How am I feeling? I hear Mrs.
Schmidt come in to see you.

1396
01:21:20,418 --> 01:21:23,264
That's right. That's right.

1397
01:21:24,105 --> 01:21:28,548
There's some loose cash here
belongs to you, $200,000 worth.

1398
01:21:29,071 --> 01:21:30,959
Uh-huh, and there's
something else too.

1399
01:21:35,563 --> 01:21:37,160
What diary?

1400
01:21:38,453 --> 01:21:41,453
Who's gonna believe what a
little tramp writes to herself?

1401
01:21:41,780 --> 01:21:43,308
Wait a minute!
Don't hang up!

1402
01:21:43,538 --> 01:21:45,438
Here's some advice for you,
friend.

1403
01:21:45,726 --> 01:21:48,462
Don't press your luck.
Lay off of me.

1404
01:21:48,689 --> 01:21:50,303
Don't print that story.

1405
01:21:50,328 --> 01:21:53,001
What's that supposed to be?
An order?

1406
01:21:53,074 --> 01:21:56,885
If not tonight, then tomorrow.
Maybe next week. Maybe next year.

1407
01:21:57,118 --> 01:21:58,902
But sooner or later,
you'll catch it!

1408
01:21:59,042 --> 01:22:02,639
Listen to me! Print that
story, you're a dead man!

1409
01:22:02,963 --> 01:22:04,736
It's not just me anymore.

1410
01:22:05,263 --> 01:22:07,627
You'd have to stop every
newspaper in the country now,

1411
01:22:07,652 --> 01:22:09,022
And you're not big enough
for that job.

1412
01:22:09,046 --> 01:22:12,432
People like you have tried it before,
with bullets, prison, censorship,

1413
01:22:12,708 --> 01:22:15,825
But as long as even one newspaper will
print the truth, you're finished.

1414
01:22:15,940 --> 01:22:18,739
Don't give me that fancy double-Talk!
I want an answer.

1415
01:22:18,826 --> 01:22:20,040
Yes or no?

1416
01:22:32,609 --> 01:22:34,195
Yes or no?

1417
01:22:38,844 --> 01:22:41,492
Hey! Hutcheson?

1418
01:22:41,752 --> 01:22:43,216
That noise.
What's that racket?

1419
01:22:43,242 --> 01:22:46,632
That's the press, baby,
the press,

1420
01:22:46,701 --> 01:22:49,543
And there's nothing
you can do about it. Nothing.
