00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,400
LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY

2
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,500
Brooklyn, New York...
in the 1880's.

3
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,300
I never saw a man meet death
with finer courage.

4
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,900
Don't let her stay in there too long.

5
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,100
Dearest, is Father...

6
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,500
is Father well now?

7
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:39,600
Yes, dear, he's well, he's quite well,

8
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,700
but we have no one left
now but each other.

9
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,900
No one at all.

10
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,900
My baby!

11
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,600
<i>Ceddie was not old enough to
<i>know of anything else to do,</i>

12
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,800
<i>so he did what he could</i>

13
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
<i>and was more of a comfort to
<i>her than he understood.</i>

14
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,700
Strawberries! Fresh strawberries!

15
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,500
Strawberries!

16
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,500
Fresh strawberries!

17
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,200
He'll be pleased, won't he?

18
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,700
Ach, the darlin'! To think of him
getting the like of that for his birthday.

19
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,200
Sure he'll be the happiest boy in all
Brooklyn till he falls off of it!

20
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,200
Dearest!

21
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,500
Dearest!
- All right, Ceddie.

22
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
Oh, Dearest... Look! Look!

23
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,100
Mary's brother, Michael, has made
it for me and Mary's given me this book.

24
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,000
It's "The Adventures of Robin Hood
and His Merry Men".

25
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,000
Listen,

26
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,200
<i>Back varlets! Touch Maid Marian at your
<i>peril. However many you be, I defy you all!</i>

27
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,400
See, Dearest, you're Maid Marian,
and I'm Robin Hood.

28
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,500
They crowd around you. I'll never leave
your side however many there are!

29
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,500
Oh! - Now, Dearest, you cry out:
"Help me, Robin Hood!"

30
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,100
Help me, Robin Hood! Help! Help!

31
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,000
Down with you, varlets! Now I'm...
- Oh!

32
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,200
There!

33
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,100
Do you like it?

34
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,300
Oh my!

35
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,000
Of all events in my life
this is the most magnificent!

36
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:38,200
Do you really like it, darling? It's what
you wanted? - It's exactly what I wanted!

37
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,900
I do hope it is! Only you will be careful,
won't you and not let it run away with you?

38
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,400
I suppose I'm about the safest bicycle
rider in the whole Brooklyn!

39
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,000
Ha-ha - d'ya mind that now!

40
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,000
Can I ride it now, Dearest?
Can I go now? - Go!

41
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,500
I can't wait one minute.
Mr. Hobbs has to see it and Dick.

42
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,000
Can I go now, Dearest, at once?
- Yes, dear, only do be careful.

43
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,900
All right, there we are!

44
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,100
Bring it down slow.

45
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,700
Ceddie! Ceddie!

46
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,400
Do be careful of the streetcars
if you get out the sidewalk.

47
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,700
Oh, I will! - Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

48
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,000
Good-bye, Dearest!

49
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,100
Good-bye!

50
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,600
Ah-ha! Be careful.

51
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,800
I'll be careful, I'll be careful,
I'll be careful.

52
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,300
I'll be careful.

53
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,800
Good morning, Mrs. McGillycuddy.
- Good morning, Ceddie, a very good morning.

54
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,700
How are your bones
today, Mrs. McGillycuddy?

55
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,400
Oh, none too good after
the rainstorm yesterday.

56
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,500
Oh, they ached last night somethin' cruel.

57
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:42,000
Ties me up in knots the rain does.
- Does it? How very peculiar.

58
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,900
But, ah, it's a fine day to go bicycle riding.

59
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,000
Oh, I suppose so, for them that
has bicycles and can ride them.

60
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,600
I suppose everybody who has a new bicycle
will take it out and ride it today.

61
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,100
Glory be the goodness! And whose
bicycle might that be? - It's mine!

62
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,200
It's my birthday present from Dearest.
- Oh, it's a daisy, shure.

63
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,100
Fine enough for the president to ride.
- And it has all the latest improvements.

64
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,800
Oh! Sorta sounds like
the bells of St. Patrick!

65
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,100
Shure it's the luckiest
boy in the world ya are.

66
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,700
Well I'll have to be going.

67
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,000
I nearly forgot. Please choose my
apple now, Mrs. McGillicuddy.

68
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,100
But would you mind keeping it for me
until I get back? -Sure.

69
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,600
<i>Oh, there he goes oh, there he goes
<i>All dressed up in his purty clothes</i>

70
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,600
<i>The way ain' near away'n it be
<i>That's as tough as it's going to be</i>

71
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,700
Hey, where'd ya get de ice wagon?
- I'd like to get by, please.

72
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,700
Give us a little ride, will ya, bub?
- I'm sorry, no.

73
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:15,500
Aw, scared I'd get it dirty?
- No, but I'd rather ride it myself.

74
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,600
[indistinct protesting]

75
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,600
Hey, English, when did ya get back from
dear old London? - I'm not English.

76
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,500
I'm American.
- Then where'd ya get that kinda gab?

77
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,800
My Father was English.
- Oh, does yer mudder know you're out?

78
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,400
Don't you dare talk about my mother!
- Mama's pet!

79
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,800
Mama's pet! Mama's pet! Ha, ha, ha.

80
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,000
I think you'd better take your hand off
that wheel. - Want to make anything out of it?

81
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,600
I want to make you get out of the way.

82
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,400
Ooh, ha... ha.

83
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,500
You don't dast, you sissy cat.?- Sissy cat! Sissy cat!

84
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,100
Ha, ha... ha.

85
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,100
Wait a minute, Ceddie!
Don't let them bluff you! I'll be right there.

86
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,100
Ha, ha... ha.

87
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,700
Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha!

88
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,700
Let go!

89
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,000
Go on, Dick! Strike him on the snoot!

90
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,400
Booo!

91
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,600
Hit him with the right!
Poke him in the kisser!

92
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,200
Heh, cheese it - a cop!

93
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Here, ye young devils!
Git outta here! Git out! Git out!

94
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,900
Aw, why couldn't that copper
leave us alone? - We had 'em licked!

95
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,600
Thanks terribly for coming
to my rescue, Dick.

96
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,100
That makes us even for me
givin' ya de mumps, hunh?

97
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,900
They didn't even scratch it.

98
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,700
Gee whillikers! Where'd you swipe that?

99
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,300
Dearest gave it to me. Isn't it
magnificent? - It's a lalapalooza!

100
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,400
I want you to be the very first
person to ride on it. - Aw, t'anks.

101
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,800
Ahem!

102
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,600
Aw!

103
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,300
Thank you very much for your assistance, Mr.
O'Brien. - It's a pleasure, Ceddie, me lad.

104
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,600
Course, I think we might have won anyway.

105
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Sure, and don't I know it! But I had
to keep ya from committin' murder.

106
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,600
I tell you what, Dick. I'll just go once
around the block and then you can ride it

107
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,500
to Mr. Hobbs store.

108
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,400
Make it later, 'cause I gotta see
me brudder Ben off. He's goin' out West.

109
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,100
Oh, is he? Where? Texas?
- No, Chicago.

110
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:50,500
Oh, that would be splendid!
Riding mustangs and shooting bears!

111
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,200
Dere's me brudder Ben now.

112
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,500
Come on, Dick. I've got to leave.

113
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,400
Well, come on down to Mr. Hobbs' store
as quickly as you can.

114
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,300
HOBBS' FANCY VEGETABLES & GROCERIES

115
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,800
What do you say to a little birthday party?
Ginger pop and cookies, and some candy?

116
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,900
That would be perfect Mr. Hobbs! Only...
- Only?

117
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,900
Well, oh, Dick's coming very soon and
I was thinking, oh, if we could wait.

118
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,800
I guess there'll be enough to go around.

119
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,800
There's a lump coming,
I think, quite a big one!

120
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,500
What are you reading, Mr. Hobbs?

121
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,500
Ah! That's the way they go on now.
British aristocracy!

122
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,400
I've got no use for 'em - earls and
marquises goin' around as if they was

123
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,100
lords of creation, wearin' their coronets.

124
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,600
Did you ever know any marquises, Mr. Hobbs,
or earls? - No, I should say not.

125
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,700
I'd just like to catch one of 'em
inside here, that's all!

126
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,600
I'll have no graspin' tyrant sittin'
around on my cracker barrels!

127
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,700
Perhaps they wouldn't be earls
if they knew any better.

128
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,900
Oh, wouldn't they though!
They just glory in it! It's in 'em.

129
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,600
They're a bad lot.

130
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,300
Here you are, Dick. Just in time
for Ceddie's birthday feast.

131
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,200
Jimminity... ginger pop and everything!

132
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,800
Here's to your health, Ceddie.
Many happy birthdays!

133
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,900
Thank you very much, Mr. Hobbs.

134
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,200
Why, Mary?

135
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,200
Come on home, darlin'.
The mistress is wanting ya.

136
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,900
Oh, glory be! Would you look at your face!

137
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,300
I'm very sorry, Mr. Hobbs, but I shan't be
able to stay for the feast.

138
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,700
Is anything wrong with the Dearest?
- Not at all. Sure, there's nothin' the matter.

139
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,400
What's happened, Mary?
- Now, don't be askin' me any questions.

140
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,400
But there's the queer, strange things
happenin' to us.

141
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,900
If you'll forgive me, Mrs. Errol, you must
not disregard the great position

142
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,200
to which your son has fallen heir through
the death of his uncle, your late husband's brother.

143
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,700
But what it amounts to, Mr. Havisham, is
that you want to take my boy away.

144
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,600
Mrs. Errol, you must remember
that I'm acting quite impersonally

145
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,600
and simply as the lawyer of the earl of Dorincourt.

146
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,900
The earl of Dorincourt disowned his son

147
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,400
and has refused to recognize
his grandson until now.

148
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,500
Why should I give up my boy?

149
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,400
I'm afraid I've been very stupid,
Mrs. Errol. I should have told you.

150
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,100
My instructions are that you shall accompany
Lord Fauntleroy to England. - Oh!

151
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:23,500
However, I must remind you that Lord
Dorincourt is not very friendly towards you.

152
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,400
He's an old man and has always
had very strong prejudices

153
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,700
against America and Americans and was
bitterly opposed to his son's marriage.

154
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,000
He's fixed in his determination
not to see you.

155
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,200
You will live at the lodge and a suitable
income will be provided for you.

156
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,300
The only stipulation is that you make no attempt

157
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,600
to visit your son in the castle,
nor even enter the Park Gates.

158
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,900
There's your sister, Mary.

159
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,200
Hello, Bridget. Why, what's the matter?

160
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,000
It's Michael! He's worse and we've no
money we can't pay the rent.

161
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,000
I don't know what... 

162
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
- Now, Bridget, I've
more important things to attend to!

163
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,400
I wonder what your husband's wishes
would have been in this matter?

164
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,600
You knew my husband?

165
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,700
Yes, I knew Captain Errol well
and liked him, as everybody did.

166
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,900
He was greatly attached to his old home.
- Yes, I know.

167
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,900
He, above everyone, would have appreciated
what this means to your son

168
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,800
the very great advantages he'll have.

169
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,800
Yes, you're right.

170
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,500
My husband would have wished it.

171
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,900
Mr. Havisham, I must ask you to let me
tell Ceddie about this in my own way

172
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,100
and in my very own time. He must never
know his grandfather dislikes me.

173
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,400
If he did, it would make it harder
for them to be friends.

174
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,400
Very well. Your son will thank you
for this when he is a man.

175
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,900
I hope his grandfather will love Ceddie.

176
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,200
He has a very affectionate nature
and he's always been loved.

177
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,200
This is Mr. Havisham, dear, whom your
grandfather sent to see us,

178
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,500
all the way from England.

179
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:33,800
How do you do, sir?
- So this is little Lord Fauntleroy.

180
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,700
You see, dear, your grandfather has no
more children now, and he's very lonely.

181
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,400
So he wants us to go
and live with him in England.

182
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:58,500
Because he's an earl and you're his heir,
you will have a new name - Lord Fauntleroy.

183
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,300
And someday you will be
the earl of Dorincourt.

184
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,100
Oh, Dearest, do I have to be an earl?
None of the boys are earls.

185
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,300
Can't I not be one? - I'm afraid it can't
be helped, dear.

186
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,900
Just think, dear,
soon we'll be starting for England.

187
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,700
Do we have to go to England, Dearest?
I'd much rather not.

188
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,000
Oh! What will Mr. Hobbs say?

189
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,900
Anything else ma'am?
- How much is your table butter?

190
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,700
13 cents a pound.
- 13! The last I bought was 12,5 cents.

191
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,100
Must've been last month. It's 13 today.
- Oh, indeed. Well, never mind the butter.

192
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,100
Heavens and earth, if the prices go any
higher, we'll all starve to death!

193
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,100
Good day!
- Good day, ma'am.

194
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,900
Hello, Ceddie. What's the matter?

195
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,600
Mr. Hobbs, do you remember what we were
talking about yesterday morning?

196
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,300
It seems to me we was
talkin' about England.

197
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,800
Yes, yes and earls. Don't you remember?

198
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,500
Oh, yes, we did touch 'em up a little.
That's so.

199
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,200
You said you wouldn't have them sitting
around your cracker barrels.

200
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,000
So I did and I meant it too!
Just let them try it, that's all!

201
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,600
Mr. Hobbs, one is sitting on this barrel now.

202
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,900
What?
- Yes.

203
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,500
I'm one or I'm going to be.
I won't deceive you, Mr. Hobbs.

204
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
It's the heat!

205
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
It is a hot day.

206
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,200
How do ya feel? Got any pain?

207
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,800
Thank you, I'm all right.

208
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,100
I'm sorry to say it's true, Mr. Hobbs.

209
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,900
Mr. Havisham, he's a lawyer, came all the way
from England to tell us about it.

210
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,400
My grandfather sent him.

211
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,800
Who is your grandfather?

212
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,200
I couldn't very easily remember it,
so I wrote it down.

213
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,600
John Arthur Molyneux Errol,
earl of Dorincourt.

214
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,500
That's his name, and he lives in a castle
'er two or three castles, I think.

215
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:22,800
All his sons have died now. That's why I
shall be an earl. Now I'm Lord Fauntleroy.

216
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,400
Well, I'll be jiggered.
One of us has got a sunstroke.

217
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,400
Oh, no, we haven't. We'll have
to make the best of it, Mr. Hobbs.

218
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:41,100
What did you say your name was?
- Cedric Errol Lord Fauntleroy.

219
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,000
Well, I am jiggered.

220
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,500
Well... you always did talk
more English than American.

221
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,600
You think there's no getting out of it?

222
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,300
I'm afraid not, Mr. Hobbs.

223
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,300
Dearest says that Father
would wish me to do it

224
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,400
but if I have to be an earl,
I can try to be a good one.

225
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,700
I'm not going to be a tyrant, Mr. Hobbs

226
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,200
and if there's ever to be another war
with America, I shall try and stop it.

227
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,100
England's a long way off, isn't it?

228
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,000
It's across the Atlantic Ocean.

229
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,800
That's the worst of it. Perhaps
I shan't see you for a long time.

230
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,400
I don't like to think about that, Mr. Hobbs.

231
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,800
Well... the best of friends must part.

232
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,700
I'm afraid, Mr. Havisham, our American
food must seem very strange for you.

233
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,000
A little, ma'am. I find that muffins are
biscuits, and biscuits are cookies

234
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,000
but the cooking's excellent.

235
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:04,300
And after all, it's the company that
makes the meal exquisite, not the food.

236
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,600
Thank you, Mr. Havisham.

237
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,700
When you're an earl, you'll give splendid
dinners in one of the most beautiful castles

238
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,400
in England.

239
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,800
Do you know, I'm not sure I know
exactly what an earl is?

240
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,500
If anybody's going to be one,
he ought to know, don't you?

241
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,500
Would you mind explaining it to me?

242
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,400
Well, someone is made an earl generally
because he's done some service

243
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,300
to his sovereign or some great deed.
- Oh, that's like the president!

244
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,900
Oh, is it? Is that why
your presidents are elected?

245
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,400
Yes, sir, When a man's very good and
knows a great deal, he's elected president.

246
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:42,400
And they have torchlight processions, and
bands, and everybody makes speeches.

247
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:47,100
I used to think I might like to be president
but never thought of being an earl.

248
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,600
No, being an earl is rather different
from being a president.

249
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,200
An earl is generally
of very ancient lineage.

250
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,800
Uh, what's that?

251
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,400
A very old family - extremely old.

252
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,700
Oh, that's like the apple woman.
She's a hundred, I should think.

253
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,400
She's of such ancient lineage, it'd
surprise you how she can stand up.

254
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,000
You feel sorry for anyone who's so poor
and has such ancient lineage.

255
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,300
She says hers has gone into her bones
and rain makes it worse. - Ha, ha, ha.

256
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,800
When I said ancient lineage,
I didn't mean old age.

257
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,200
The first earl of Dorincourt was created
an earl hundreds of years ago.

258
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,300
Well, that was a long time ago,
wasn't it Dearest? - Yes, dear.

259
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,300
Many earls have been very brave men
and have fought in great battles.

260
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,500
I should like to do it myself.

261
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,800
My father was a soldier and a very brave
man as brave as George Washington.

262
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,600
I'm glad earls are brave.
That's a great 'vantage.

263
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,700
Would you excuse me a moment, please?
There's someone I must see. - Oh, certainly.

264
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,200
There's, um, there's another
advantage of being an earl.

265
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:59,200
Some of them have a great deal of money.

266
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:05,300
That's a good thing to have. I wish I had
a great deal of money. - Do you? Why?

267
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,600
There's so many things
a person can do with money.

268
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,400
If I were rich, I'd buy the apple
woman a tent to put her stall in

269
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,800
and a stove. I'd give her a shawl, because
then her bones wouldn't feel so badly.

270
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,000
What else would you do
if you were rich?

271
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,500
I'd buy Dearest all sorts
of beautiful things. - Dearest?

272
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,200
I call Mother, "Dearest"
because Father did.

273
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,400
Then there's Dick.
- And who's Dick? - Dick's a bootblack.

274
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,700
I'd buy him some new cloths, some brushes
and a new sign - and start him out fair.

275
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:40,200
He says that's all he wants is to start
out fair. - Hmm. Is there anything else?

276
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,700
Well, I think Mr. Hobbs would
like a gold watch and chain.

277
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,500
But what would you get just
for yourself, if you were rich?

278
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,600
Isn't there one particular thing
you've dreaming of having? - Yes.

279
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,400
A pony... but I suppose that would
be too much to even dream about.

280
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,500
I'm so sorry.

281
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,900
A poor woman in trouble came to see me.

282
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,700
Oh, is it Bridget?
- Yes, dear.

283
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,000
I wish we could do something for her.

284
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,500
She has six children and her husband
is out of work.

285
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,300
He has inflammatory rheumatism and that's
the kind of rheumatism that's dreadful.

286
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,100
Before I left Dorincourt castle, the earl
said that if you expressed any wishes,

287
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:30,500
I was to gratify them and give you
anything you desired.

288
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,800
Now, here... here are five pounds -

289
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,100
in your money, 25 dollars.

290
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,400
If you have any desire to assist this
poor woman,

291
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,700
I am sure your grandfather would wish it.
- Can I have it now?

292
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,000
Can I give it to her this minute?

293
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,400
May I be excused, please, Dearest?
- Yes, Ceddie. - Bridget!

294
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,100
Bridget, wait a minute!
Here's some money!

295
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,400
My grandfather gave it to me!
It's for you!

296
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,100
That's a great deal of money, Mr.
Havisham. We've never had very much.

297
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,400
I'm just beginning to realize
the great power Ceddie will have.

298
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,000
Such a child still...
I'm a little afraid.

299
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,700
I think whom what I've seen of him
that you have nothing to fear.

300
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Oh, I hope not. He mustn't be spoilt
by all these wonderful changes.

301
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,400
She cried!
She said she was crying for joy.

302
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,300
I newer saw anyone cry for joy before.

303
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,500
My grandfather must be a very good man.

304
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,800
It's more... more agreeable being an earl
than I thought it was going to be.

305
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,200
In fact I'm almost quite glad
I'm going to be one!

306
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,100
Heh.

307
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,100
MRS. CEDRIC ERROL COURT LODGE
ERLESBORO ENGLAND

308
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:18,100
We always liked that little house, didn't
we, Dearest? - We always will like it.

309
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,700
Yes, darling, yes.

310
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,400
I've come to say good-bye.
I have to go to England to be a lord.

311
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,100
I shouldn't like your bones in my mind
every time it rains. - Oh, ho!

312
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,100
Bless your dear little heart with all kindness
to me, me bones is as quiet as anything.

313
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,400
Can I give you a kiss for luck?
- Of course.

314
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,300
Here's an apple to eat on the boat.
- Thank you very much.

315
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,700
Oh, no, darlin'... Why should you pay?

316
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,500
As me late husband used to say,
"This one's on the house."

317
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:16,500
Thank you again. Well, good-bye.
- Good-bye, darlin'.

318
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,300
Well...

319
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,200
Well...

320
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,900
Well...

321
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,500
Well...

322
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,400
Well, good-bye.

323
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,200
I hope trade will be good.

324
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,600
Chee, if trade gets any better, I'll be
rollin' around in di'monds and poils!

325
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,800
That would be splendid, wouldn't it!

326
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,700
I hope you have every sort
of luck and happiness.

327
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,700
Thanks - same to you!
An' I hope you t'ink about us sometime

328
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,700
when you're way over dere,
as dey say, "on foreign surl".

329
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,800
I'll think about you all the time. I'll
write to you. And you must write to me.

330
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,400
Here's where you send your letter.

331
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,300
Chee, I...

332
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,300
I wish you wasn't goin' away.

333
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,600
T'anks, mister, for the t'ings
you're done for him.

334
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,700
He certainly deserves 'em.
He's a game little kid.

335
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,000
Chee, I almost forgot!

336
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,100
Here, I bought dis for ya.

337
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,000
It's a hankercheef. You can use it
when you get among dem swells.

338
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,600
Oh, Dick! It's beautiful!

339
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,800
It's extraordinary!

340
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,800
I'll use it always.

341
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
Thank you, Dick.

342
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,400
Thank you very much.

343
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,700
Well... good-bye.

344
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,200
Well... good-bye.

345
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,000
Would you mind very much
not going in with me?

346
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:29,600
I think I'd better be alone.
- Certainly. I quite understand.

347
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,500
This is for you, Mr. Hobbs.

348
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,600
It'll look fine when you're smoking it.

349
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,800
Why, Ceddie...

350
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,300
That's just what I wanted for a long time.

351
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,700
This is my real present, Mr. Hobbs.

352
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,500
There's something written on it -
inside the case.

353
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,700
I told the man what to say. You read it.

354
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:38,300
<i>From his oldest friend,
<i>Lord Fauntleroy, to Mr. Hobbs.</i>

355
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,500
<i>When this you see, remember me.</i>

356
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,200
When this you see, remember me.

357
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I don't want you to forget me.
- Oh, I won't forget you.

358
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,400
Don't you go and forget me when you go
over there amongst those British aristocracy.

359
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,700
I shouldn't forget you whoever I was
among. I hope you'll come to see me.

360
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,200
Perhaps my grandfather
will write and invite you.

361
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,400
You - you wouldn't mind him
being an earl, would you?

362
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,400
I mean, uh... you wouldn't stay away
just because he was one?

363
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,600
Oh, I'll come and see you.

364
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,300
I... I won't be able to help myself.

365
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,700
Cleared!

366
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Cleared!

367
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,200
Is this Dorincourt Castle, Dearest?
- No. This is Court Lodge where your...

368
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,500
There's Mary! We had a splendid
time in London, Mary.

369
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,200
I'm so glad you came before us, Mary.
We don't feel so strange,

370
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,700
finding you here to welcome us.

371
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,600
Sure 'tis the great happiness I wish you
ma'am, in your lovely, new home.

372
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,100
This is Mrs. Baines, the cook, ma'am,
and that's Susan, the parlor maid.

373
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,800
I'm sure we'll do everything, ma'am,
to make ye comfortable.

374
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,000
Oh, I'm sure you will.

375
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,000
I must say good-bye. The carriage is
waiting to take me to the castle.

376
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,200
I must tell the earl of your safe arrival.
- He needn't go tonight?

377
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,700
I'd so like to have him with me
my first night here.

378
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,100
No, I'm sure Lord Dorincourt
won't expect his grandson tonight.

379
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,700
Tomorrow will be time enough.

380
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,800
I dread so to tell him that we're not
going to live together anymore.

381
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,000
I'm a coward, I know,
putting it off so long, but

382
00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:00,600
it's the most difficult, the most
cruel thing I've ever had to do.

383
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,800
I wish you'd tell His Lordship that
I'd rather not have the money.

384
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,900
You mean the income he wishes
to settle on you?

385
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,700
I have little money of my own
quite enough to live simply on.

386
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,000
I must accept the house, because that makes
it possible for me to be near Ceddie.

387
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,200
I'm grateful to him for that, but...

388
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,500
He'll be very angry.
He won't understand it at all.

389
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,000
I think he will understand.

390
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,600
He must understand that I can't
accept money from a man who...

391
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,000
hates me so much that he's separating me
from my boy. - I'll deliver your message.

392
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,400
I think it's beautiful here,
don't you Dearest?

393
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,100
Ceddie, darlin', there's something
I must tell you.

394
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,300
You're not going to understand it, I know,

395
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:14,700
but I want you to believe me as you
always have when I tell you it's for the best.

396
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,600
Tomorrow, Mr. Havisham will take you
to your grandfather

397
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,300
and you will live with him at the
castle. I shall not go with you.

398
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,400
This pretty house will be my home, and
Mary will be here to look after me.

399
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:36,300
But Dearest you don't mean

400
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,900
you can't mean that

401
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,300
we're not going to be together
just as we've always been?

402
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,600
Oh, no! I can't! I couldn't!

403
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,400
I won't! I won't!

404
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,200
Ceddie, you must be brave and sensible.

405
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:01,300
If there are some things you can't
understand now, you'll understand them later.

406
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,700
Its best for you to live there. There...
there are good reasons why it tis.

407
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:14,700
You mean, you want me to go away from you?
- Of course not, darling.

408
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,100
But now you're growing older and we
must trust and help one another,

409
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,800
without asking any questions.

410
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,700
And you know, Ceddie, your grandfather
loves you and wants you to love him.

411
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,000
He's so kind he... he wants you to be
happy and to make other people happy.

412
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,900
But Dearest, I can't be happy without you.

413
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,500
But you won't be without me all the time.

414
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,900
I'm not far from the castle here and
you'll run in and see me every day.

415
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:50,100
You'll love the castle and there'll always
be something new and interesting to tell me.

416
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,800
And I'll have things to tell you! Oh,
Ceddie, we'll have such good times together!

417
00:34:55,400 --> 00:35:00,500
We'll be finding things out,
both of us. We'll be explorers.

418
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,700
Yes. Like... like Mr. Stanley
and Mr. Livingston.

419
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,300
That'll be exciting.

420
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:16,800
And every night when it grows dark,
I'll put a candle in the window

421
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,300
to guide you through
the jungle, Mr. Stanley.

422
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,400
Ah, Newick. How's His Lordship?
- He's in the rare mood!

423
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,100
He told me to evict all the tenants
if they weren't paid up.

424
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,800
I dare say, that'll be a job
to your liking.

425
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,800
Oh, sir.
- Ah, Purvis, glad to see you again.

426
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,000
Very glad to see you, sir.

427
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,900
Fool! Idiot! Do what you're told,
bring what's ordered!

428
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,100
Gout?
- Oh, yes, sir.

429
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,700
These last few weeks have been
the worst I've ever known, sir.

430
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,900
I'm surrounded by a lot of incompetent
nincompoops! Shut the door, you blockhead!

431
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,400
I can't stand 'im no longer, Mr. Purvis.

432
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,500
He's too much for any man - cursin',
swearin' and callin' people out

433
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,400
of other names like 'e does.
It ain't just today, it's every day!

434
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,300
Thomas, you brought him the '63 port.
He prefers the '51.

435
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,500
'Ow was I to know? He didn't say!
- Fetch the other bottle!

436
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,200
W'at business has 'e got drinking'
Port anyway in 'is condition!

437
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,500
I can't feed and house every lout
in the parish and I won't!

438
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,700
You and your poor - I've had
enough of 'em! - But, my lord...

439
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,700
Mr. Mordaunt is with him.

440
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,800
I've said all I have to say, now, good
night! - Good day, my lord... good day.

441
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,800
I beg your pardon.

442
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,600
How'd you do, Mr. Havisham?

443
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,900
Yes, ah, Mr. Mordaunt.

444
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:27,000
Mr. Havisham, my lord.

445
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:40,500
Well, Havisham. - My lord.
- Come back, have you?

446
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,100
Put that cushion right for me, will you?

447
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,700
Aie! Aie! Careful!

448
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,400
That foot's full of hot needles!

449
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,300
Well, what have you got to tell me?

450
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,800
Lord Fauntleroy and his mother
are at Court Lodge.

451
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,600
They bore the voyage excellently,
and in good health.

452
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,200
Ah... what else? - His Lordship remains
with his mother tonight.

453
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,300
I'll bring him to the castle tomorrow.
- Well, go on! Tell me everything!

454
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:13,800
Never mind about the mother.
What sort of a lad is he, I say?

455
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,400
It's rather difficult to judge the
character of a child of nine.

456
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,700
A fool, huh? A clumsy cub?

457
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,800
I don't know much about the children,
but I thought him rather a fine lad.

458
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,500
Healthy, well grown, eh?

459
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:29,400
Apparently healthy, quite well grown.
- Straight limbed? Well enough to look at?

460
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,700
Rather handsome, my lord - as boys go.
- Ah.

461
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,500
Although I'm... I'm scarcely a judge.

462
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,800
I dare say you will find him a little
different from most English children.

463
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:45,000
No doubt of that! American children are the most
impudent and the worst brought up in the world.

464
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:50,300
I've heard that often enough.
- I would hardly call it impudent.

465
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,200
The difference is, that he has lived more
with older people than with children

466
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,700
and I should call it a mixture
of maturity and childishness. - Exactly!

467
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,000
Beastly impudent bad manners -
that what it tis!

468
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:05,400
I have a message
to deliver from Mrs. Errol.

469
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,800
I want none of her messages!
The less I hear, the better!

470
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,700
Ah, but this is rather an important one.

471
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:15,000
She prefers not to accept the income
you propose to settle on her.

472
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,500
What's that? What d'you say?

473
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,500
She says it's not necessary that as the
relations between you are not...

474
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,700
not friendly...
- Not friendly!

475
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,600
I should say they were not friendly!

476
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,100
Mercenary, sharp-voiced American!

477
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,500
My lord, you could hardly call
her mercenary. She's asked for nothing!

478
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:39,400
Nah... all done for effect! She thinks
she can wheedle me into seeing her.

479
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:44,200
Thinks I shall admire her spirit but
I don't! Have the money sent to her.

480
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:48,600
She won't spend it. - I don't care whether she
spends it! She shall have it sent to her.

481
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:53,100
She shan't tell people she's to live as a
pauper because I'm doing nothing for her!

482
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,600
I suppose she's poisoning
the boy's mind against me too.

483
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,100
No, I have another message that will
prove she's not done that.

484
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,600
I won't hear... Ow! Oh! Ah!

485
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:14,800
She asks you not to let Lord Fauntleroy
hear anything that might lead him

486
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,300
to understand that you are separating him
from her because of your prejudice against her.

487
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,600
She says he wouldn't comprehend it.

488
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:24,900
That it might make him fear you in some
measure, or at least,

489
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,900
cause him to feel less affection for you.

490
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,500
She wants there to be no shadow
on your first meeting.

491
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,800
Come now, Havisham, come now!
You don't mean that mother hasn't told him?

492
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,100
Not a word, my lord. Nothing has been said
to the boy to give him the slightest doubt

493
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,100
of your perfection.

494
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,000
He's prepared to believe you the most
amiable and affectionate of grandparents.

495
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,600
In fact, he already regards you
as a wonder of generosity.

496
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:56,000
Uh!

497
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,400
He does, eh?

498
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:05,100
I would suggest, my lord,
that Fauntleroy's impressions of you

499
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,800
depend entirely upon yourself.

500
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,000
I make a further suggestion

501
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,700
you will succeed better with him if you
take care not to speak slightingly to him

502
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,000
of his mother.
- The boy's only nine.

503
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,900
Nevertheless, those nine years have
been spent at his mother's side.

504
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,100
She has all his affection.

505
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,700
Hmm...

506
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,800
So he thinks me generous, eh!

507
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,800
Ah, Purvis, this is Lord Fauntleroy.

508
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,400
My lord. - How do you do?
- Thank you, my lord.

509
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,600
My lord.

510
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,600
This is Lord Fauntleroy, Mrs. Mellon.

511
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,500
Lord Fauntleroy, this is Mrs. Mellon,
the housekeeper. - How do you do, ma'am?

512
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:48,300
I should know His Lordship anywhere, sir.
He has the Captain's face and way.

513
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:53,100
Oh, was it you who sent the cat?
I'm ever so obliged to you, ma'am.

514
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,500
How do you do?

515
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,700
It is a great day this, sir?

516
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,100
Where is His Lordship?
- In the library, sir.

517
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,800
Lord Fauntleroy is to be
sent to him alone.

518
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,000
Lord Fauntleroy, my lord.

519
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,900
Dougal! Come back here!

520
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,700
How do you do, sir?

521
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:11,900
Are you the earl? I'm your grandson that
Mr. Havisham brought. I'm Lord Fauntleroy.

522
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,700
I hope you are quite well.

523
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,400
I'm very glad to see you.
- Hunh!

524
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,900
You're glad to see me, are ya?
- Yes, very.

525
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:37,100
I kept wondering what you would look
like if you'd be like my father.

526
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,700
Oh, and am I? - Well, I don't think you
are, very. - You're disappointed, I suppose.

527
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:46,900
Oh, no! Of course you would enjoy the way
your grandfather looked,

528
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,800
even if he wasn't like your father.
You know how it is yourself,

529
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:55,100
about admiring your relations.
- Eh? I'm not sure that I do.

530
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:58,700
Any boy would love his grandfather,
especially one who's been

531
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:02,300
as kind to him as you've been.
- I've been kind to you, have I?

532
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,600
Yes. I'm ever so obliged to you about
Bridget, and the apple woman, and Dick.

533
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:10,900
Bridget? Dick? Apple woman?
- They were particular friends of mine.

534
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,600
The ones you gave me all that money for,

535
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,600
the money you told Mr. Havisham
to give me if I wanted it.

536
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:22,300
The money you were to spend as you liked, eh?
So, you spend it all on these people, did ya?

537
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,000
Bridget, Dick, and the apple woman?

538
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:28,800
Yes, and I gave Mr. Hobbs
a gold watch and chain, and a pipe.

539
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:35,800
I put some poetry in the watch.
It was: "When this you see, remember me."

540
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:42,800
I'm going to miss Mr. Hobbs very much.
- Who is Mr. Hobbs?

541
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:48,700
He was our grocer - fancy vegetables and
groceries, you know. He's my closest friend.

542
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,800
Mr. Hobbs is a very clever man.

543
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,900
Do you know, he can recite the Declaration
of Independence right through.

544
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,900
Oh!
- What's the matter?

545
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,500
I just remembered you might not like to
hear about the Declaration of Independence.

546
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,600
I forgot you were an Englishman.
- Hunh! You forgot!

547
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,900
You were English too, didn't ye?
- Oh, no! I'm an American!

548
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,500
You are English! Your father was
an Englishman. - I was born in America.

549
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,100
You have to be an American
if you are born in America.

550
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,800
You don't... - I beg your
pardon for contradicting you.

551
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,000
Mr. Hobbs says if there's ever to be another
war, that I should have to be an American.

552
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:30,200
I promised him if there were another
war, I should try to stop it.

553
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,800
You would, would you? Ha, ha.

554
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,800
Dinner is served, my lord.

555
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:38,700
Ugh!

556
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,500
Now, be careful, man... be careful!

557
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,400
Careful now, careful.

558
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:45,700
Ow!

559
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,200
Would you like me to help you?
You can lean on me.

560
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:54,600
Once Mr. Hobbs hurt his foot with a potato
barrel falling on it.

561
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,500
He used to lean on me.
- Do you think you could do it?

562
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:00,700
I think I could. I'm very strong.
I'm nine, you know.

563
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,800
Lean on your stick on one side and on me
on the other. - Well... you may try it.

564
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:13,000
Just lean on me. I'll walk very slowly.

565
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:18,500
Don't be afraid of leaning on me.
I'm all right.

566
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,800
If it isn't a very long way.

567
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:27,900
D'you see that old fellow in red velvet?
He was the tenth earl of Dorincourt.

568
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:35,700
King George I decorated him for services
during the war with Spain and Austria.

569
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,200
He was tremendously strong, could bend
a bar of iron between his hands.

570
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:46,300
You get your strength from him.
- How... how very int'resting.

571
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,300
Did you ever try putting your foot in hot
water and mustard? Mr. Hobbs used to.

572
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:55,800
Arnica is a good thing too, they tell me.

573
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,400
Ah, thank ye. I'll try it.

574
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:19,500
It's warm, isn't it? A person can't
help getting warm in the summertime.

575
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,500
Great heavens! What's that? - It's a
present from Dick. Isn't it beautiful?

576
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,100
<i>When this I see, I...</i>

577
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,400
I shall always remember Dick.

578
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:40,500
Yes, I should think you would.
It would be difficult to forget him.

579
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,600
Dick's a professional bootblack.
You'd like him. He's so square.

580
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:51,400
Square? - Yes, he wouldn't cheat anyone
or hit a boy under his size.

581
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,000
Oh. Very praiseworthy.

582
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,500
Thank ye.

583
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,600
What's the matter?
Don't you like your soup? - Oh, yes.

584
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,800
I was just wondering.
- Wondering? Wondering what?

585
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,500
You don't wear your coronet
all the time, then?

586
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,800
No, no. It, er, it doesn't become me.

587
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:25,500
Mr. Hobbs said you wore it all the time.

588
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:31,500
After he thought it over, he said you must
take it off sometimes to put your hat on.

589
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:37,400
Yes, I, ah...

590
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,400
I take it off occasionally.

591
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,500
You must be very proud of your house.
I never saw anything so beautiful.

592
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,700
It's a very big house for just two people
to live in, isn't it?

593
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,000
Do you think it's too large?

594
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:04,000
I was only thinking that if two people
lived in it who were not good companions,

595
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:08,500
they might get a little lonely. - Do you
think I shall make a good companion?

596
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:14,400
Yes, I think you will. I think you should be
almost as interesting as Mr. Hobbs. - Oh.

597
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:20,700
Mr. Hobbs and I were very great friends.
He was the best friend I had expect...

598
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:32,400
Fauntleroy, what are you thinking of?
- I was thinking of Dearest.

599
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:36,900
Who is Dearest?
- She is my mother.

600
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:45,400
I... I think I'd better get up
and... and walk up and down.

601
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,800
He's a very nice dog. He's my friend.

602
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,800
He knows how I feel.

603
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,500
How do you feel?

604
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,400
Come here.

605
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,700
You see, I... I never was away
from my own house before.

606
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:35,800
It... it makes a person feel a strange
feeling when he has to stay all night

607
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,600
in another person's castle,
instead of his own house.

608
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:45,000
But... but Dearest is not very far away
from me. She told me to remember that.

609
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,200
And, after all, you know,
I'm nine, you know

610
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,300
and I can look at the picture she gave me.

611
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:57,800
Look! You press this spring
and it opens and there she is!

612
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,800
I suppose you think you're very fond of her?
- Yes, I do think so and it's true.

613
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,600
Mr. Hobbs and the others were my friends,
but Dearest is my close friends.

614
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,900
My father left her to me to take care of.

615
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:31,700
And when I'm a man, I'm going to
work and earn money for her.

616
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:33,600
Oh, and what do you think of doing?

617
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,700
Well, I did think of going
into business with Mr. Hobbs

618
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,900
but I should like to be president.

619
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,800
We'll send you to
the House of Lords instead.

620
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:49,900
Well, if I couldn't be president and if
that's a good business, I shouldn't mind.

621
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,600
The grocery business is dull sometimes.

622
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,900
Yes, so is the House of Lords,
but it's the business

623
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,400
that every earl of Dorincourt goes into.
- I shall have to talk to Dearest about it.

624
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:39,600
Good night.

625
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,200
God keep you all the night.

626
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,700
Morning, Thomas.
- Good morning, sir.

627
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,500
Where's His Lordship?
- In his library, sir and such goings on

628
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,300
I've never heard in my life!
- Do you think, it'll be all right?

629
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,900
Yes sir, he's expecting you.
- Oh!

630
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:05,600
Ah-ha.

631
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:13,100
Oh... ha, ha.

632
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:15,500
Ah...

633
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:19,700
Morning, Mordaunt.
I've found a new employment, you see.

634
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,400
Any good at marbles, Mordaunt?

635
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:27,000
My muscles are a little stiff, my lord,
but... I'll see what I can do.

636
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,700
Hah, pity about that!
I'd forgotten about your age.

637
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,900
Ha, ha, ha.

638
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,700
Ouch! Oh!

639
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,300
This is the new Lord Fauntleroy.

640
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,500
Fauntleroy, this is Mr. Mordaunt,
rector of the parish.

641
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:42,000
I'm very glad to make
your acquaintance, sir.

642
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:45,000
I'm delighted to make
your acquaintance, Lord Fauntleroy.

643
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:47,800
Well, what is it this morning,
Mordaunt? Who's in trouble now?

644
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:51,300
It's one of your tenants,
my lord. Higgins of Edge Farm.

645
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,600
Newick has told him that if he doesn't
pay the rent he must leave the place.

646
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,900
He's a bad tenant, always behind,
Newick tells me.

647
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
He's devoted to his wife and children,
and if the farm is taken from him,

648
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:06,500
they may literally starve.
- That's like Michael!

649
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,400
I forgot we had a philanthropist here.

650
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,300
Come here.

651
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:19,300
What would you do in this case?

652
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,400
If I were very rich, I should let him stay
and give him things for his children.

653
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:27,500
Nonsense! You're Lord Fauntleroy. It's time
you learned to deal with these situations.

654
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:32,000
You can write, can't ya?
- Yes, but not very well.

655
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:34,700
Well, go over to the desk
and write Newick his orders.

656
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,800
Now, what must I say?
- You must say:

657
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,800
Higgins is not to be interfered
with for the present.

658
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,600
Oh!

659
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,800
And sign it, "Fauntleroy."

660
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,700
Do you think it will do?

661
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:08,500
<i>Dear mr. Newik if you pleas mr. higins is
<i>not to be inturfeared with for the present</i>

662
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,500
<i>and oblige. Yours rispecferly</i>

663
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,700
<i>"FAUNTLEROY."</i>

664
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:13,900
Yes.

665
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,900
Higgins will find it
entirely satisfactory.

666
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:21,600
Mr. Hobbs always signed his letters that
way and I thought Id better say "please."

667
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,300
Is that exactly the right
way to spell "interfered?"

668
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:29,300
Well, it's not exactly the way it's
spelled in the dictionary, but...

669
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:31,000
I was afraid of that.

670
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,800
Yes, Higgins won't
complain of the spelling.

671
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,100
I think you must be the best person in the
whole world, don't you, Mr. Mordaunt?

672
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,600
I shall write and tell Mr. Hobbs.

673
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,600
Oh, what'll you tell him?

674
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:46,900
I shall tell him I think you're the
kindest man I ever heard of,

675
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:50,300
and that you're always thinking of other
people and making them happy and...

676
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,300
and that I hope when I grow up
I shall be just like you!

677
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,000
Just like me, eh?

678
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:08,200
There you are, Mordaunt. Take that with
you. - I will indeed. This is good news!

679
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:10,900
Thank you, my lord. - Oh, don't
thank me, thank Fauntleroy.

680
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:15,400
Thank you.
- Good-bye, sir. - Good-bye.

681
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:27,100
May I go to see Dearest now?
I think she'll be waiting for me.

682
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:30,300
There's something for you to see
in the stables first. Ring the bell.

683
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:31,900
In the stables!

684
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:39,500
If you please, I'm very much obliged,
but I think I'd better see it tomorrow.

685
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:44,900
She'll be expecting me all the time.
- Ah, very well. We'll order the carriage.

686
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
You don't care to see what's
in the stables? - Oh, I do! I do!

687
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,100
Oh, it doesn't matter, it's only a pony.

688
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,000
A pony! Whose pony is it?
- Yours.

689
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,400
Mine!
- Yes.

690
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:06,900
Oh, I never thought I'd have
a pony! I never thought that!

691
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,300
How glad Dearest will be.

692
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:13,100
You give me everything, don't you?

693
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:15,400
Wouldn't you like to see it?

694
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:20,800
Of course I want to see it! I want
to see it so much I can hardly wait

695
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,300
but I'm afraid there isn't time.

696
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:32,600
You must see your mother this afternoon?
You can't put it off till tomorrow?

697
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:38,000
Why, she's been thinking about me all the
morning and I've been thinking about her.

698
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:39,400
Oh, you have, have you?

699
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,900
Very well, ring the bell.

700
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:08,500
Let me give you your stick. Lean on me
when you get out. - I'm not going to get out.

701
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:13,900
Not... not to see Dearest?
- Dearest will excuse me.

702
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,400
Tell her that even your new pony
would keep you away.

703
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,500
She'll be disappointed.

704
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,100
She'll want to see you very much.
- I am afraid not.

705
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:32,500
The carriage will call for you as we
come back. Drive on, Jeffries.

706
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,300
It's a shame, parted from his own mother.

707
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,100
Cook at Court Lodge was telling Sarah
she'd never worked for a sweeter lady

708
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,200
than Mrs. Errol.

709
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,700
The letter was written by the
little gentleman his own self.

710
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:16,600
Signed with his name too, "Fauntleroy,"
as large as life. - The little precious!

711
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,900
Ay, that's the mother.
- A pretty young thing too.

712
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,800
Good morning, my lady.
- Good morning.

713
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:27,200
God bless you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

714
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,900
Good morning.
- Good morning.

715
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:37,200
It's His Lordship coming to services.
That's a new notion.

716
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,800
They say even 'is gout's improving.

717
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:50,000
An' look at the young lord.
- He's captain Cedric all over again.

718
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,500
He's the Captain's self to the life.

719
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,300
How glad the people are to see you.

720
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:00,500
Take off your hat, Fauntleroy.
They're bowing to you. - To me?

721
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
How do you do?

722
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,800
God bless, Your Lordship. Long life to ya.

723
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,400
Thank you.

724
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:14,500
Good morning, my lord.

725
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,700
<i>[organ plays "Crown Him With Many Crowns"]</i>

726
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:00,300

May I whisper?
- What is it? - Who are they?

738
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:03,800
Some of your ancestors who lived
a few hundred years ago. - Oh!

739
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:07,000
Perhaps I got my spelling from them.

740
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:12,100
<i>...Shepherd King of Israel's fold</i>

741
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:16,000
<i>The Babe of Bethlehem</i>

742
01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:24,400
Well, Higgins?
- Oh, is this Mr. Higgins?

743
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:28,900
Yes, I suppose he's come to look
at his new landlord. - Yes, my lord.

744
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:32,800
I understand His young Lordship
was kind enough to speak for me

745
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:34,800
and I thought I'd like to say
a word of thanks.

746
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:38,400
I've got a great deal
to thank Your Lordship for.

747
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:42,100
Oh, I only wrote the letter.
It's my grandfather who did it.

748
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:44,600
You know how good he always is to people.

749
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:48,500
Is Mrs. Higgins well now?
- Yes, Your Lordship.

750
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,100
The Missus is better since
the trouble was took off her mind.

751
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:56,300
My grandfather was very sorry about
your children having the scarlet fever.

752
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,900
You see, Higgins, you people
have all been mistaken about me.

753
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:05,600
Lord Fauntleroy understands me. If you
want a little reliable information

754
01:04:05,700 --> 01:04:08,400
on the subject of my character, apply to him.

755
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,000
Get into the carriage, Fauntleroy.

756
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:39,700
You miss your mother very much?
- Yes, sir. I miss her all the time.

757
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:45,200
You don't miss her, do you?
- I don't know her.

758
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:49,000
I know and that's what makes me wonder.

759
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,400
She told me not to ask
any questions, and I won't.

760
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:56,200
Well, you see her almost every day,
don't ye? Isn't that enough?

761
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:01,100
We used to see each other all the time
and we could tell each other things

762
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,500
without waiting.

763
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:06,700
Well, don't you ever forget
about her? - No, sir. Never.

764
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I shouldn't forget about you, you know.

765
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:16,100
If I didn't live with you I should
think about you all the more.

766
01:05:21,100 --> 01:05:22,800
Upon my word I believe you would!

767
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:37,200
<i>My Dear Mr. Hobbs.</i>

768
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:42,300
<i>I must tell you about
<i>my grandfather immediately.</i>

769
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:48,600
<i>It's all a mistake earls being
<i>tyrants. He's not the tyrant.</i>

770
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:53,800
<i>He has the gout in his
<i>foot and is a great suffer.</i>

771
01:05:53,900 --> 01:05:59,900
<i>He is such a good earl. He reminds
<i>me of you. He is a universal favorite.</i>

772
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,900
Well... Reminds me of you...

773
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,500
Think of that, now. He's known this
earl only a little while, and we...

774
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,400
We was lifetime acquaintances.

775
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:15,500
I don't know as I want him to be
reminded of me by this earl.

776
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:18,600
They been usin' influence of
him, I betcha. - You're right.

777
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,500
They got twisty ways, those aristocrats!

778
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,800
They'd wheedle their little finger around
your heart as soon as look at you,

779
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,800
all for their own purposes, mind!

780
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:30,600
It's a pity they're makin'
an eril outta him. - Yeah...

781
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:36,100
He would have been a shinin' light in
grocery business, a shinin' light!

782
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:40,300
You know any particklars 'bout dat
stuff like castles and erils?

783
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:44,200
No, not much,
except they're haughty and mean.

784
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,600
Sure is a jim-dandy letter he wrote. Almost
as good as seein' him only it ain't o' course.

785
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:55,500
Aw, he was a plumb-daisy of a kid. I betcha
sometimes he wishes he was back here.

786
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,900
I do.
- You lonely?

787
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:02,300
Aw, not so bad.
- Where you livin' now?

788
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:05,400
Me an' two udder fellas, we got a room
in a lodgin' house.

789
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,200
The udder two get drunk and
fightin' but it's cheap.

790
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,700
That's no sort of a place
for a lad like you to be livin'.

791
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:15,700
Now, look here, I gotta clean,
dry loft over my stable

792
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:19,600
and there's an old bed you can have.
Why don't you come here and stay?

793
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:24,100
It won't cost you a cent.
- Chee! D'ya mean dat, Mr. Hobbs?

794
01:07:24,100 --> 01:07:26,400
Why, I certainly do.
- Ya...hoo!!

795
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,300
Chee, Mr. Hobbs! Talking about erils -
you ain't no eril - you're a prince!

796
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:32,100
Aw, phsaw!

797
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,100
I wonder whether he will
have an American accent.

798
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:50,400
My dear, won't it be interesting if he
has the Dorincourt eyebrows? - Ha, ha, ha!

799
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:55,200
When do we see the mother? - I believe she's
supposed to be kept in the background.

800
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:04,200
Well, Molyneux, is this the boy?
- Yes, Constantia, this is the boy.

801
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:07,000
Fauntleroy, this is your great-aunt,
Lady Lorridale.

802
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:11,400
How do you do. Great-Aunt? - How d'ye
do young man? You're like your father.

803
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:14,700
I loved him more than most
people in this wicked world.

804
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:18,200
Did you know my father?
- Know him? Of course I did.

805
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:22,500
Oh, then you must meet Dearest! She will
enormously like to talk to you about him.

806
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:27,000
You see, I was the only one she could
talk about him to, who knew him.

807
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,000
I was so small when he...

808
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:32,300
Yes, Fauntleroy, this is your
great-uncle, Sir Harry Lorridale.

809
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,000
How do you do, sir?
- Hear, you're fond of horses.

810
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:39,300
I'll confess to you, Constantia, that
what you will probably see for yourself

811
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:43,700
there's a risk of my becoming rather
an old fool about him. - Becoming?!

812
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:48,500
Ha, ha, ha! - By the way the mother,
what does she think of you?

813
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:50,500
I don't know. I haven't asked her.

814
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:53,800
You must come over to
Lorridale Park to see us.

815
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:57,800
There are some new cocker puppies in the
kennel. You shall have your pick.

816
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:02,300
Oh, thank you very much, indeed, uncle,
only, Dougal might be offended.

817
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:07,000
He's very fond of me and I really shouldn't
like to hurt his feelings. - Ha, ha, ha.

818
01:09:07,600 --> 01:09:10,700
Hurt his feelings! That's a good one!
Did you hear that, Con?

819
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:13,000
Hurt his feelings! Ha, ha, ha!

820
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:18,500
This is Miss Herbert, Fauntleroy.
I want you to be great friends with her.

821
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:23,000
How do you do? Have you met Dougal?
He shakes hands beautifully.

822
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,000
Shake hands with Miss Herbert, Dougal.

823
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:31,900
He's a great friend of mine. I like
making friends, don't you? - Yes, I do.

824
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:36,100
May I be your friend? And Dougal's?
- Oh, yes, if you please!

825
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:41,300
How's your lumbago, Fortescue?
Better, I hope? - Thanks. Much better.

826
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:46,600
I've known Dorincourt as well as anyone
could know him for five and thirty years,

827
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,800
and that's the first time he's ever
bothered to inquire about my health!

828
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:52,800
Most extraordinary!

829
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,400
Well, Havisham, you're late.
What's kept you?

830
01:09:57,500 --> 01:10:00,400
I beg your pardon, my lord. I was
detained by extraordinary news.

831
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:04,900
News? What... what news? - Not now,
if you don't mind. Later, my lord, later.

832
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,900
<i>The young May moon is beaming, love</i>

833
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:22,800
<i>The glowworm's lamp is gleaming, love</i>

834
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:27,300
<i>How sweet to rove through Morna's Grove</i>

835
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:31,800
<i>While the drowsy world is dreaming, love</i>

836
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:35,800
<i>Then awake! Till rise of sun, my dear</i>

837
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,600
<i>The Sage's glass we'll shun my dear</i>

838
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:44,300
<i>Or in watching the flight
<i>of bodies of light</i>

839
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:49,000
<i>He might happen to take
<i>thee for one, my dear</i>

840
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:54,800
Charming! Charming! What a sweet song!

841
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:57,100
Thank ye, my dear, thank you.

842
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:02,100
Do you like music?
- Yes. I like it when you sing it.

843
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:08,300
Tell me, Lord Fauntleroy, why you look at
me so? - I was thinking how beautiful you are.

844
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:12,800
Fauntleroy, make the most of your time. When you're
older, you'll not have the courage to say that!

845
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:16,300
Nobody could help saying it.
Don't you think, she's pretty too?

846
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:20,700
We're not allowed to say what we think.
- Lord Fauntleroy shall say what he thinks.

847
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:22,800
I am sure he thinks what he says.

848
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:26,900
I think you're prettier than anyone I ever
saw, expect Dearest.

849
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:31,100
I think she's the prettiest person
on the world. - I'm sure she is.

850
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,100
And I must tell her how kind youve been to me.

851
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:39,300
I never was at a party before,
and I've enjoyed myself so much.

852
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:42,100
Oh, I beg your pardon.

853
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:51,000
Good night, little Lord
Fauntleroy. Sleep well.

854
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:03,600
Good night. So glad you came.

855
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:14,100
Well, Havisham,
what in the world's the matter?

856
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:17,400
Something serious must have happened
to make you behave like this. What is it?

857
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,900
It's bad news, the very
worst of news, my lord.

858
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:25,100
I'm sorry to have to be the bearer of it.

859
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:29,900
Why do you look at the boy so? You
hang over him like a bird of ill omen.

860
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,500
Has it anything to do with Fauntleroy?

861
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:40,600
My lord, I'll waste no words. My news
has everything to do with him.

862
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:44,200
If we are to believe it, it's not Lord
Fauntleroy who lies asleep before us,

863
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:46,200
but only the son of Captain Errol.

864
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,600
The present Lord Fauntleroy is the son
of your boy Bevis, and at this moment

865
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:55,500
is in a lodging house in London.
- What do you mean? You're mad!

866
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:01,100
It's a lie!

867
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:04,600
An abominable lie!

868
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:07,600
If it's a lie, it's painfully like the truth.

869
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,600
A woman came to my chambers this morning
and told me that she married your son Bevis

870
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:16,900
in London 11 years ago.
She showed me the marriage certificate.

871
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:20,900
The child was born shortly after Bevis
deserted her and was taken by her to America.

872
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,800
The woman's obviously an imposter!
It's a trumped-up fraud!

873
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,700
I'm afraid not, my lord.
I saw the boy's birth certificate.

874
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,800
She is, I'm afraid, a very ignorant person

875
01:13:31,900 --> 01:13:35,000
but she has consulted a lawyer who advises
her, that her son is, of course,

876
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,900
Lord Fauntleroy and the rightful heir.

877
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,400
She demands that his claim
be immediately acknowledged.

878
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:43,400
I'll protest this to the last!
I'll disown Bevis' boy!

879
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,400
I'll have nothing to do with him or his
mother! - You can't disown him, my lord.

880
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:51,600
Nothing we can do can keep the eldest
son's child from his inheritance.

881
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:04,900
The woman, you say is an
ignorant vulgar person, eh?

882
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:10,500
She can hardly spell her own name. She is
obviously uneducated and openly mercenary.

883
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:17,300
And I... I objected to his mother.

884
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,100
I suppose it's retribution.

885
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,700
If anyone have ever told me that I could
be fond of a child,

886
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:30,500
I wouldn't have believed them.

887
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:36,200
I always detested children -
my own more than most.

888
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:44,300
But I'm fond of him, and oddly
enough - he's fond of me.

889
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:49,900
You know, Havisham, I'm not
popular. I never was

890
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:53,000
but he is fond of me.

891
01:14:54,700 --> 01:14:59,400
He never was afraid of me,
always trusted me.

892
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:09,000
Yes, Havisham, he'd have filled my
place better than I've filled it.

893
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,500
He'd have been an honor to the name.

894
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,200
You rang, my lord?

895
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:21,300
Take...

896
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:24,200
take Lord Fauntleroy

897
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:26,200
to his room.

898
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:47,200
What a pity! The boy's
thoroughbred if ever there was one.

899
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:49,400
I suppose you may say it's a
judgment of Molyneux.

900
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,200
That boy...

901
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,900
the first human being he ever loved!

902
01:15:54,900 --> 01:15:57,300
Will Molyneux take the case
to the courts d'you think?

903
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,300
Can't tell. He's obstinate enough.

904
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,900
You go in with your best suit,
buckles on your shoes

905
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:04,800
and you come out as nature made you

906
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:09,400
Bless my soul, Constantia, whoever would
have dreamed that I'd felt sorry

907
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,300
for the old boy!

908
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,400
I wouldn't have minded our having
a boy like that, Harry.

909
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,500
Yes, bit of luck for us,
old girl, if we had. - Yeah.

910
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,500
I'll tell you one thing - if his
Little Lordship loses his title,

911
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:24,600
the village loses the best friend it has.

912
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:29,400
That's right. An' I'll tell you another thing -
it'll drive the earl mad if this goes wrong for him.

913
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:32,600
He's been so proud of the boy,
you hardly believe it

914
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:36,400
if you knew him for what he was before.
- And the new one's no lady, that's sure.

915
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,600
Bold-faced thing, that's what she is.

916
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:41,300
The dark-eyed brazen-faced wench!

917
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,200
'Ere's the earl comin' now
with Mr. Havisham.

918
01:16:50,600 --> 01:16:53,500
You've somebody here calling herself
Lady Fauntleroy? I want to see her.

919
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,700
Come the ways, my lord. This way, my lord.

920
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:01,600
Come in.

921
01:17:07,200 --> 01:17:08,900
T' earl of Dorincourt!

922
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:19,100
Pleased to meetcha, I'm sure, my lord.

923
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:26,800
Bevis!

924
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:34,900
Go shake hands with your grandpa.

925
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:53,200
So that's the way you're
gonna treat your grandson?

926
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,900
You needn't try to look so fierce about
it - he's your grandson all right!

927
01:17:57,300 --> 01:18:00,500
Ah, yes, me lord, we have proof
of young gentleman's birth.

928
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,400
He is the son of the late Lord Fauntleroy.

929
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:07,500
Allow me to introduce myself.
Joshua Snade at your service. My card.

930
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:12,700
I've already had the pleasure of making
Mr. Havisham's acquaintance.

931
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:16,800
Lady Fauntleroy has placed
all the evidence in my hands.

932
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:21,500
I can assure you, lord, it is sufficient
to justify her case should it come into court.

933
01:18:21,900 --> 01:18:25,400
But may I suggest that, uh,
we come to an arrangement

934
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:28,600
and settle this matter amicably
on a friendly basis...

935
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:30,100
Friendly? Huh!

936
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:33,800
Look at him starin' as though I was
dirt! His own daughter-in-law!

937
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:37,800
Oh, your son Bevis married me,
all right and a fine rotter he was!

938
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:40,800
But he was the father and I can
prove it! - Lady Fauntleroy, please...

939
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,200
You may think you can fight me -
a lot of good it'll do!

940
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:45,600
They don't love you - you know it!

941
01:18:45,700 --> 01:18:48,700
I've heard plenty about you
and your dirty, snobbish pride!

942
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:51,000
Plenty of pride you'll have when
I'm finished with you!

943
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:55,500
Unless you want to get reasonable
with your own flesh and blood.

944
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:56,700
Lady Fauntleroy, I beg you...
- Shut up!

945
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,400
I'll stop at nothing! I drag this case
through every court.

946
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:04,500
I'll let the world know what you are -
you and your precious son Bevis!

947
01:19:04,900 --> 01:19:08,000
Deserting me and his own
child - a babe in arms!

948
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:11,700
How I've suffered,
heaven only knows!

949
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,800
And you standin' and lookin' at me
and my boy as if we was scum!

950
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,500
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!

951
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:18,900
You say you married my eldest son.

952
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:22,000
If that's proved to be true,
the law's on your side.

953
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:28,300
In that case your son will be Lord
Fauntleroy. and you will be provided for.

954
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:32,200
But I warn you - the matter
will be sifted to the very bottom.

955
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:38,400
I'll only add that I want to see nothing
of you or your boy as long as I live.

956
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:43,600
After my death, you can, unfortunately,
do as you please.

957
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:52,500
Yes, you're exactly the kind of person that I
should have expected my son Bevis to choose.

958
01:19:57,500 --> 01:20:00,000
Ha, ha, ha!

959
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,500
I'm afraid, Dorincourt,
there can be no two opinions.

960
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:08,900
At least, that's how I see it.
You agree, Semple?

961
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:13,600
Yes, I'm afraid we can see it no
other way. - But it's... it's monstrous!

962
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:18,700
That woman...
that boy are utterly unfit!

963
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,500
Alas, the law can take
no cognizance of such things.

964
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:25,800
I sympathize, Dorincourt, more than I can
say. - Sympathize! What's the use of that?

965
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:30,600
If we take it to the courts there can
be only one result? - I'm afraid so.

966
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,400
The birth certificate, everything
we have, point the same way.

967
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:36,500
If you take it to court, you'll have
the expense and notoriety,

968
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:39,200
and only, I fear, one possible result.

969
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:42,600
Perhaps the boy won't turn
out so badly as you fear.

970
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,500
Perhaps you can do something
with him. - That boy?

971
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,200
That... oaf!

972
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:56,800
With the other one - yes.

973
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:00,700
Well...

974
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,700
I have no other course but
to accept your judgment.

975
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:09,000
Come, Havisham. - Thank you, my lord.
- And you, Mr. Semple.

976
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:21,100
It's the earl, ma'am. The earl himself!

977
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,200
Show him in.

978
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:45,600
Mrs. Errol, I believe.
- Yes, I'm Mrs. Errol.

979
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,700
I'm Lord Dorincourt.

980
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:51,300
The boy is very like you.

981
01:21:52,200 --> 01:21:53,600
People have often said so.

982
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:59,000
I'm glad to think he's like his
father too. - Yes, he is - like my son.

983
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:02,500
Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

984
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:14,000
I've come to tell you that I've had the
very best, the highest legal opinion.

985
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:19,700
But I'm sorry. This outrageous
woman and her child...

986
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:23,600
Perhaps she cares for him as much as
I care for Ceddie, my lord.

987
01:22:23,700 --> 01:22:26,300
Her son is Lord Fauntleroy - mine's not.

988
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,600
Yes, I'm afraid you're right.

989
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,300
Perhaps you would have preferred that
Ceddie should not be the earl of Dorincourt.

990
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:40,300
It's a very magnificent thing to be
the earl of Dorincourt, my lord. I know that.

991
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:44,400
But all I care about is that Ceddie
should be what his father was -

992
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:48,000
brave, just and kind always.

993
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:52,700
Hmm, a striking contrast
to what his grandfather is, eh?

994
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,700
I haven't had the pleasure
of knowing his grandfather.

995
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,500
I know my little boy believes...

996
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,200
I know that Ceddie loves you.

997
01:23:03,100 --> 01:23:06,500
Would he, if you have told him why
I didn't receive you at the castle?

998
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:11,800
No, honestly, I think not. That's
why I didn't wish him to know.

999
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:18,300
Well... there are very few women
who wouldn't have told him.

1000
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:25,700
Dearest, Ceddie is fond of me.

1001
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:29,200
And I am fond of him.

1002
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:32,900
I can't say

1003
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:36,600
that I was ever fond of anyone before.

1004
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:40,600
But he pleased me from the first.

1005
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:44,500
I'm an old man and
I was tired of my life.

1006
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:47,700
But he's given me something to live for.

1007
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:53,700
More than that - more than
that, I am proud of him!

1008
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,800
I was satisfied to think that one day

1009
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:02,900
he'd be taking my place
as the head of the family.

1010
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:08,100
I'm miserable...

1011
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:11,600
miserable!

1012
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:24,400
Please, sit down. You've been so
much troubled, you must be tired

1013
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:26,300
and you need all your strength.

1014
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:28,800
Thank you.

1015
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:39,100
Perhaps it's because I'm
miserable, I've come to you.

1016
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:42,000
I used to hate you.

1017
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:44,900
I've been jealous to you.

1018
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:48,900
But this wretched disgraceful
business has changed all that.

1019
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:52,500
And after seeing this repulsive woman who...

1020
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:56,400
Well, I felt it would be
a relief to come to you.

1021
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:03,500
I'm an obstinate old fool, I suppose.

1022
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,900
I... I know I've treated you badly.

1023
01:25:12,100 --> 01:25:14,700
But I've come to you
because the boy cares for you

1024
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,400
and because I care for him.

1025
01:25:23,800 --> 01:25:25,000
Treat me as well as you can

1026
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:27,800
for the boy's sake.

1027
01:25:39,700 --> 01:25:42,100
Whatever happens,
he shall be provided for.

1028
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:46,200
Ceddie shall be taken care
of now, and in the future.

1029
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:48,600
Always!
- Thank you.

1030
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,400
Do you like the house?

1031
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:53,900
Oh, very much.

1032
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:55,900
It's a cheerful room.

1033
01:26:00,500 --> 01:26:04,400
May I come back again and
talk this matter over?

1034
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:06,900
As often as you wish.

1035
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:32,900
You've heard bad news, haven't you?
- Yes. The worst.

1036
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:38,300
Then I'm not Lord Fauntleroy
anymore, am I?

1037
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,200
No, she's beaten me.

1038
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:44,700
Then, the other boy...

1039
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,300
he will... have to be...

1040
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:51,000
your boy now, won't he? Like I was?
- No!

1041
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,100
But he'll have to live in the castle
if he's Lord Fauntleroy, won't he?

1042
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:58,100
That common little brat shall never
enter this place in my lifetime!

1043
01:26:58,300 --> 01:26:59,300
I'll take care of that!

1044
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:04,500
Then, I can still be your boy
even if I'm not going to be the earl

1045
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:06,900
just like I was before?

1046
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:08,800
My boy!

1047
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:12,900
Yes, you'll be my boy as long as I live.

1048
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,400
And, by Jove, sometimes I think you're
the only boy I've ever had!

1049
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:23,100
Then, I don't care about
the earl part at all.

1050
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:30,500
I thought, you see, that the one that was
going to be the earl had to be your boy

1051
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,000
and that I couldn't be.

1052
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:36,700
They shall never take anything from you
that I can hold for you.

1053
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:41,700
Come what may, you shall have
all that I can give - all!

1054
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:46,300
And Dearest? Will the house
be taken away from her?

1055
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:49,000
No, they can take nothing from her -

1056
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:51,800
nothing from either of you!

1057
01:27:55,400 --> 01:27:58,300
Come, it's time you were asleep.

1058
01:28:29,300 --> 01:28:32,800
Good night, Grandfather.
-. Good night, my boy.

1059
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:44,300
<i>...the aged earl remains
<i>secluded in his castle</i>

1060
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:48,200
<i>and refuses to have any communication
<i>with the rightful heir.</i>

1061
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:51,200
We know dat stuff. Dey've been
printing 'dat for de past week

1062
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:52,800
Is dere anyt'ing new about Ceddie?

1063
01:28:53,300 --> 01:28:54,500
Yes! Here it says.

1064
01:28:56,200 --> 01:29:01,000
<i>The prospects do not look very bright for the
<i>false claimant, Cedric Errol of Brooklyn.</i>

1065
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:03,600
Well, I'm jiggered.

1066
01:29:07,700 --> 01:29:10,700
At last they've succeeded in robbin'
him outta bein' a earl.

1067
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:14,100
I thought you was ag'inst erils?
- So I am!

1068
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,900
Ain't it just like 'em - cheatin'
the poor kid outta his rightful estates!

1069
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:21,400
Now, what's goin' to become of him?

1070
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:24,100
I know one thing. He done everyt'ing for
me - he can always come back

1071
01:29:24,200 --> 01:29:26,000
an' have half of my shoe-shining business.

1072
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:27,900
Well now, I'll tell you, Dick,

1073
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:32,800
I'd always had it in my mind
that Ceddie would come in with me someday.

1074
01:29:33,900 --> 01:29:35,700
He'd be a shining light
in the grocery business.

1075
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:41,600
<i>The new Lady Fauntleroy
<i>was formerly an actress.</i>

1076
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:47,500
<i>She is said to have played in New York
<i>and London. Continued in page 5.</i>

1077
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:50,300
Here's a picture of her.

1078
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:58,000
Holy mackerel!
- What?

1079
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:00,000
Look at this! it's her!
- Her?

1080
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,100
She ain't no 'ristocrat! I know her as
I know you! It's Minna, Ben's wife!

1081
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:07,000
Your brother's? - Sure!
- You mean it's some hocus-pocus?

1082
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:09,000
Sure I do.
- Well, I'm jiggered.

1083
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:12,700
She was married before - I never hoid of
her havin' no other kid but Ben's.

1084
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:15,600
The one Ben went to look for?
- Sure.

1085
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:19,200
Maybe she had another kid in England.
- Maybe she did - maybe she didn't.

1086
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:21,800
We'd oughta do somethin' about it.
- You're dead right, we'd oughta!

1087
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:25,400
But we gotta get the proper advice.
- Chee, I wisht I knew Alderman Moiphy.

1088
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:27,800
I know Alderman Moiphy.

1089
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:31,200
Ya do? - Yeah, come along,
let's go right now!

1090
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:35,300
Them earls! They've always had a spite
against us Americans ever since the revolution!

1091
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:44,300
What a place! What a hole!
I'm sick to death of it!

1092
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:49,200
Cooped up here week in and week out
with nobody to talk to!

1093
01:30:49,300 --> 01:30:51,700
You're complimentary!
- I wasn't meaning to be! - I'm grateful.

1094
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:54,800
You're getting your money, aren't you?
- Business is business, you know.

1095
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:59,400
Business! I'm sick of business! I want
some fun! - Why don't you go to London?

1096
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:02,300
London? Not on your tintype!

1097
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:05,900
Nothing would please that old devil at
the castle better than to see me clear out.

1098
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:09,800
Well, I'll stay here... here in this
rotten country pub if I...

1099
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,000
You've lived in worse places, I've no
doubt! - That's none of your business!

1100
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:18,100
You keep a civil tongue or I'll hand you
your walking papers! - I wouldn't.

1101
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:24,800
What do you mean? - Just what I said.
I wouldn't try anything like that, Minna.

1102
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:29,200
I'm Lady Fauntleroy, to you!
- Ha, ha.

1103
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,200
Come in!

1104
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,300
Why, it's Lord Dorincourt!

1105
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:42,400
Why, this is a pleasure, a real
pleasure, I'm sure. Won't you take a...

1106
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:45,300
Hello, Minna.

1107
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:47,800
Why, hello, Dick.

1108
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:59,700
Why, Ben. What are you doing here?

1109
01:32:00,300 --> 01:32:01,700
Where have you been all this time?

1110
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:07,500
You knew her? - Funny, if he didn't...
seein' how he was my second husband.

1111
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:11,500
Where is the child? - What child?
- You know, our boy, Tom.

1112
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:15,800
Oh, Ben, but you know...
You must have heard...

1113
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:19,000
Someone must have told you.
- Told me what?

1114
01:32:19,700 --> 01:32:25,300
It was pneumonia. Only three days
and he was gone. It broke my heart.

1115
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:28,100
I meant to write.
I didn't know where you were.

1116
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:31,300
If that's true, who is this
boy you've got with you?

1117
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:32,700
That's none of your business, Ben Tipton!

1118
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:38,800
Can I see him? - You can't! - Tell us why
Mr. Tipton should not see your boy?

1119
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:42,200
Oh, hello, Uncle Dick.

1120
01:32:43,900 --> 01:32:44,900
Well, I'll be jiggered!

1121
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:48,000
Mom, honest, I'm sorry...
- Shut up!

1122
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:51,900
You're a dirty pair, comin' to spy on me!
Tryin' to do me hurt!

1123
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:55,300
I'll have the law on ya
for houndin' me, you... you... you...

1124
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:56,300
Silence!

1125
01:32:58,500 --> 01:32:59,400
Come here, Tom.

1126
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:09,400
I knew nothing, my lord, I assure you!

1127
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:13,700
There's a little matter of a forged birth
certificate. - But I swear to you!

1128
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:16,700
Never mind, Havisham.
I've had enough of this - too much!

1129
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,200
The sooner you are out
of this country, the better!

1130
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:23,300
Come on, Havisham. - You'll be sorry - you will!
It's prosecution, that's what it is - it's robbery!

1131
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:37,400
<i>The Earl of Dorincourt and Ceddie requests
<i>the pleasure of Mr. Silas Hobbs company</i>

1132
01:33:37,500 --> 01:33:41,700
<i> on the eleventh of May at
<i>8 p.m. at Dorincourt Castle</i>

1133
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:47,400
<i>of the occasion of the tenth birthday
<i>of his grandson Lord Fauntleroy.</i>

1134
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:55,800
This will be somewhat in the manner
of a museum, my lord?

1135
01:33:55,900 --> 01:34:00,100
Not exactly a museum, Mr. Hobbs.
They are portraits of my ancestors.

1136
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:03,900
Your aunt's sisters!["ancestors"] All of them?

1137
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:09,100
Well, I'll be jiggered! Your great-uncle,
he must have had a family!

1138
01:34:09,700 --> 01:34:11,000
Did he raise 'em all?

1139
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:14,500
Ah, you mean that they were early
distinguished members of the family.

1140
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:19,800
Do you know, earl, I used to have a very
poor opinion of your aristocracy,

1141
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:25,500
but I've changed. Take you, for instance,
you're a good sort, even if you are an earl!

1142
01:34:25,700 --> 01:34:26,700
I'm very gratified.

1143
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:35,300
A bit gay, wasn't he? - Yes, that's why
I have the gout, Mr. Hobbs.

1144
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:37,700
Oh!

1145
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:45,600
And they was all earls! And Ceddie's
goin' to be one and own all this!

1146
01:34:45,700 --> 01:34:49,200
And he'll be worthy of it, Mr. Hobbs.
- Sure he will.

1147
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:52,100
All these earls!

1148
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:57,100
Do you know, I wouldn't have
minded bein' one myself! - Hmm!

1149
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:01,500
Speech! Speech! Speech!

1150
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,000
Speech! Speech!

1151
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:07,400
Thank you very much.

1152
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:13,700
It's such a lovely day. I always like having
birthdays, but never one so much as this,

1153
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:15,300
because you're all so kind to me.

1154
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:19,300
My grandfather wants everybody to be
happy and comfortable

1155
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,500
and I'll want it too when I'm grown up.

1156
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:27,500
I think that's all, because I'm not very
good of making speeches.

1157
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:32,300
But I must say that I'm very much obliged
to you for liking my birthday.

1158
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:39,100
Ripping little nipper!
- Ain't he a daisy?

1159
01:35:39,500 --> 01:35:41,400
I'll bet you boids elect him king some day!

1160
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:46,400
I didn't know the little feller
could talk so good.

1161
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:49,600
He makes a better speech than
Alderman Murphy - by Jove.

1162
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:51,900
Ugh, well, I'll be jiggered!

1163
01:35:53,400 --> 01:35:55,400
And I've another birthday present for you.

1164
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:59,800
Another one, besides all the things this
morning? - Yes, the best of them all.

1165
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:03,900
Oh, Dearest!

1166
01:36:04,700 --> 01:36:06,100
Oh, Dearest!

1167
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:13,900
Oh, Dearest, I was wanting you here!
I was wanting you here so terribly much!

1168
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:14,900
Were you, darling?

1169
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:19,100
Fauntleroy, your mother has
come to live in the castle.

1170
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:22,900
To live with us, to live with us for always?
- Are you sure you really want me?

1171
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:26,200
We always wanted you, but we
weren't exactly aware of it.

1172
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:31,500
Well, Mr. Hobbs, it's so nice
having you here with us.

1173
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:33,900
I dread to think of you
going back to America.

1174
01:36:34,300 --> 01:36:36,300
Not to live there!

1175
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:39,600
America's a good enough country for
them that's young and stirrin',

1176
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:45,000
but there's faults in it! There's not an
aunt's sister among 'em, nor an earl!
