1
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:44,163
Well, here we are.
I turn down here at the next block.

2
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,874
Thanks, mister. I'll get off there.

3
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,297
[jukebox: up-tempo band music]

4
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:56,384
- Want anything else?
- No.

5
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:57,552
Hey, you.

6
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:03,266
- Me?
- Yeah, you. Where ya heading?

7
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,686
- East.
- Too bad.

8
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:10,439
I thought if you was headin' north,
I might be able to help you out.

9
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:13,276
Pushing to Salt Lake,
and I don't like to ride alone at night.

10
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,028
I'm one of those guys that gotta talk
or I fall asleep.

11
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,738
- Oh.
- So I gotta get my...

12
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,157
My partner,
he's got Lou to keep him company.

13
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:21,909
But I ain't got nobody at all.

14
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:24,620
- Where ya comin' from?
- West.

15
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,331
Yeah, sure, I know,
but where? LA?

16
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,792
- Maybe.
- Got a cousin out in LA.

17
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,586
- You don't say?
- Yeah, he's been out...

18
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,505
You're not much of a talker, are ya?

19
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,507
My mother taught me
never to speak to strangers.

20
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:38,426
- Oh, a wise guy, huh?
- So what?

21
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,430
Okay, okay. Don't get sore.
Just trying to be sociable, that's all.

22
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,308
- Hey, Glamorous.
- [coin clatters]

23
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,018
Give me change for a dime, will ya?

24
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,233
- [register rings]
- [coin clatters]

25
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,821
Let's have something quieter this time, Joe.

26
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,907
- My head's splitting.
- Is that what's wrong with it?

27
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,450
[chuckles softly]

28
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:07,747
- Done with your coffee?
- No. And don't rush me, will ya?

29
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:11,250
[jukebox: new song plays, up-tempo]

30
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,173
Hey, turn that off.
Will ya turn that thing off?

31
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,050
- What's eating you now?
- Yeah, what's eating you?

32
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,052
- That music. It stinks!
- Oh, you don't like it, huh?

33
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,220
- No, turn it off!
- Now wait a minute, pal.

34
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:24,972
That was my nickel, see?

35
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:28,059
This is a free country,
and I play whatever I want to.

36
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,645
Okay.

37
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:33,022
Sure. And if you don't like,
you don't have to listen to it.

38
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,066
And you can leave here anytime you wanna.

39
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,692
Okay, okay. I'm sorry I asked.

40
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,986
First good piece played tonight,
and you don't like it.

41
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,489
Some people just ain't got any good taste.

42
00:04:44,076 --> 00:04:47,161
[music continues]

43
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,962
[thinking] That tune. That tune!

44
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:58,297
Why was there always that rotten tune?

45
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:01,175
Following me around, beating in my head,
never letting up.

46
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,181
Did you ever wanna forget anything?

47
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,518
Did you ever wanna cut away
a piece of your memory or blot it out?

48
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:14,397
You can't, you know?
No matter how hard you try.

49
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,440
You can change the scenery,

50
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,609
but sooner or later
you'll get a whiff of perfume,

51
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:21,195
or somebody will say a certain phrase
or maybe hum something.

52
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,531
Then you're licked again.

53
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,994
"I Can't Believe That You're in Love with Me."

54
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,954
I used to love that song once.

55
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,124
So did the customers back in the old
Break O' Dawn Club in New York.

56
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,711
I can't remember a night when I didn't get
at least three requests for it.

57
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,756
Sue, she was always selling it too.

58
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,550
Those were the days.

59
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,635
[song continues]

60
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,559
[song continues, live combo playing]

61
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,245
# Your eyes of blue
Your kisses too #

62
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,123
# I never knew what they could do #

63
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:19,420
# I can't believe that you're in love with me #

64
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:23,132
# You're telling everyone you know #

65
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,343
# That I'm on your mind each place you go #

66
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:31,223
# They can't believe
That you're in love with me #

67
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:38,189
# I have always placed you far above me #

68
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:43,778
# I just can't imagine that you love me #

69
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:47,073
# And after all is said and done #

70
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,284
# To think that I'm the lucky one #

71
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:55,748
# I can't believe that you're in love with me #

72
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:04,715
[Al narrating] It wasn't much of a club, really.

73
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,300
You know the kind.

74
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,385
A joint where you could have a sandwich
and a few drinks,

75
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,055
and run interference for your girl
on the dance floor.

76
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,101
- [playing romantic melody]
- I fronted the piano in there every night

77
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,311
from 8:00 until the place closed up,

78
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,563
which usually meant 4:00 in the morning.

79
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,066
A good job as jobs went in those days.

80
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,739
Then, too, there was Sue,

81
00:07:28,824 --> 00:07:31,784
who made working there
a little like working in heaven.

82
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:36,372
But how we felt about each other, well,
there was nothing very unusual in that.

83
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,834
I was an ordinary healthy guy,
and she was an ordinary healthy girl,

84
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,170
and when you add those two together,
you get an ordinary healthy romance,

85
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,672
which is the old story.

86
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,426
Sure. But somehow
the most wonderful thing in the world.

87
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,846
[continues playing, rapidly]

88
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,436
All in all, I was a pretty lucky guy.

89
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,494
Mr. Patterewsky, I presume?
It's beautiful.

90
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,663
You're going to make Carnegie Hall yet, Al.

91
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,332
Yeah. As a janitor.

92
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:22,251
I'll make my debut in the basement.

93
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:26,005
I don't blame you for being bitter,
darling, but you mustn't give up hope.

94
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,798
- Why, some day...
- Yeah, some day,

95
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,633
if I don't get arthritis first.

96
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,385
In the meantime, let's blow this trap.

97
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,845
[piano lid thuds]

98
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:49,737
[door closes]

99
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,782
- Like to get something to eat, hon?
- Oh, I don't think so, Al.

100
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,911
I lose my appetite working in this fleabag.

101
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,954
- Let's go home.
- Okay.

102
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,416
I can't stand much more of that dump.

103
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,211
Did you see that drunk tonight
trying to paw me?

104
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,547
- No, what drunk?
- Does it matter what drunk?

105
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,800
Say, what's the matter with you tonight, darling?

106
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,511
That's the third time you started
to tell me something and then stopped.

107
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,806
We shouldn't have any secrets
from each other, Sue.

108
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,267
Next week, we're gonna make with a ring
and a license. We'll be a team.

109
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:23,395
Yes, that's right. In the bush league.

110
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,190
- I don't get ya.
- We've been struck out.

111
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,276
That's a funny way to talk, darling.

112
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,737
- Don't you wanna marry me?
- Al, look, I love you.

113
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,198
You know I do.
And I want to marry you.

114
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,742
- But...?
- But not now.

115
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,286
Only after we've made good.

116
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,996
Sunday I'm going away.

117
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,666
Oh, I know you'll think it's silly.

118
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,001
That's why I hesitated to tell you.

119
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,795
But I'm going to California.

120
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:50,297
I wanna try my luck in Hollywood.

121
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,758
[Al] That's the most
stupid thing I ever heard of.

122
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,387
Don't you know millions of people go out there
every year and wind up polishing cuspidors?

123
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,638
I thought you had better sense.

124
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,598
You sound as if you think
I don't have any talent.

125
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:02,101
- That has nothing to do with it.
- I'll make out all right.

126
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:03,936
Maybe. But what about me?

127
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,563
Doesn't it mean anything to you
that you're busting up all our plans?

128
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:09,817
- We may not see each other for years?
- It won't be that long.

129
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,111
- I thought you loved me.
- I do.

130
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:13,737
You know I do.

131
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:18,325
Well, here we are.

132
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:21,787
Al...

133
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,541
Al, why can't you see my side of it?

134
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,294
I'm young. We both are. And...

135
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:31,005
And we've got all the time in the world
to settle down.

136
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,966
[sighs] Really, darling.

137
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,303
What I'm doing is the only sane thing to do.

138
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,889
[sighs] I... I hate the thought
of being so far away from you.

139
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,226
But... But we'll be together again some day.

140
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:47,563
[sighs] Maybe you'll decide
to come out too, later on.

141
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,898
- So long.
- Al.

142
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:53,068
Aren't you gonna kiss me good night?

143
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,237
Sure, why not?

144
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:58,991
Good night.

145
00:11:05,248 --> 00:11:07,708
[playing romantic melody]

146
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:34,276
[playing jauntily, jazzy]

147
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,164
[changing rhythm, slower]

148
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:12,231
[changing rhythm, jittery]

149
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,824
[no audible dialogue]

150
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,717
[piano playing stops]

151
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,469
- [applause]
- Say, Roberts.

152
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:45,848
You hit the jackpot this time. Ten bucks.

153
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,391
Thanks.

154
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,024
[Al narrating] So when this drunk handed me
a ten-spot after a request,

155
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,526
I couldn't get very excited.

156
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,363
What was it, I asked myself?
A piece of paper crawling with germs.

157
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,866
Couldn't buy anything I wanted.

158
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,242
It couldn't...

159
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:09,705
Then I thought of something.

160
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,313
Long distance.

161
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,857
I'd like to put a call through to Los Angeles.

162
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,193
Miss Harvey. Sue Harvey.

163
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,069
H-A-R-V-E-Y.

164
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,615
The number is CRestview 65723.

165
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,386
- 4.50.
- [coin clatters]

166
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,347
- 4.75.
- [coin clatters]

167
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,431
5.00.

168
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:15,020
Hello, Sue? This is Al.

169
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,356
Oh, baby, it's great to hear from you too.

170
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,651
What's that? You do?
Oh, me too, darling.

171
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:23,362
I thought I'd go batty without you.
I just had to...

172
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,446
Huh?

173
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,449
You're workin' as a hash slinger?

174
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,867
Gee, honey, that's tough.

175
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:32,371
Those guys out in Hollywood don't know
the real thing when it's right in front of them.

176
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,164
You just stick it out, Sue, baby.

177
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:37,417
Keep goin' around to those casting offices.
I'm sure you'll click.

178
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,629
Look, I'll tell you what.
You stay put out there. I'll come to you.

179
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,632
No, don't try to stop me. Just expect me.

180
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,760
Train? Who knows?
Train, plane, bus, magic carpet.

181
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:50,430
I'll be there if I have to crawl.
If I have to travel by pogo stick.

182
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:53,809
And then... let's get married right away.

183
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,439
That's the stuff. That's what
I've been wanting to hear you say.

184
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:03,110
Well, good-bye for now.

185
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,905
I'll be seeing you soon. [kisses]

186
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:10,492
Yeah. [kisses] Bye.

187
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,500
[Al narrating] The only way I could
cross country was to thumb rides,

188
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:21,587
for even after hocking everything,
I only had enough money to eat.

189
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,923
Money. You know what that is.

190
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,551
It's the stuff you never have enough of.

191
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,720
Little green things
with George Washington's picture

192
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:33,432
that men slave for,
commit crimes for, die for.

193
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,226
It's the stuff that has caused
more trouble in the world

194
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:38,186
than anything else we ever invented,

195
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:41,273
simply because there's too little of it.

196
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,442
At least I had too little of it.

197
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,319
So it was me for the thumb.

198
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,170
Ever done any hitchhiking?

199
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,881
It's not much fun, believe me.

200
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,842
Oh, yeah,
I know all about how it's an education,

201
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,595
and how you get to meet a lot of people,
and all that.

202
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,849
But me, from now on
I'll take my education in college,

203
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:20,187
or in P.S. 62, or I'll send $1.98
in stamps for ten easy lessons.

204
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:33,367
Thumbing rides may save you bus fare,
but it's dangerous.

205
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,954
You never know what's in store for you
when you hear the squeal of brakes.

206
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,001
If only I had known what I was getting into
that day in Arizona.

207
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,546
Here, throw that in the back seat.

208
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,301
Okay, let's go.
Make sure that door's closed.

209
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:53,553
- [door closes]
- [lock clacks]

210
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:09,319
You know, Emily Post ought to write
a book of rules for guys thumbing rides.

211
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:13,031
Because as it is now you never know
what's right and what's wrong.

212
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:17,285
We rode along for a little while,
neither one of us saying anything.

213
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,538
I was glad of that.

214
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:22,457
I never know what to say
to strange people driving cars.

215
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:26,545
And too, you can never tell
if a guy wants to talk.

216
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:29,631
A lot of rides have been cut short
because of a big mouth.

217
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,845
So I kept my mouth shut
until he started opening up.

218
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,473
Hand me that little box
in the compartment, will ya, pal?

219
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,936
Hold the wheel, will ya?

220
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:45,397
[pills rattling]

221
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,029
[glove box closes]

222
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,450
- How far are ya going?
- LA.

223
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,577
Well, you're really traveling aren't ya?

224
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,704
Yeah, but I don't expect to make it
for a couple years

225
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,372
at the rate I've been promoting rides.

226
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:03,582
Not much luck, huh?

227
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,459
Sure. All bad.

228
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,753
Not many people stop for a guy these days.

229
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,296
Afraid of a stickup maybe.

230
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,505
Ah, you can't blame 'em.

231
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,675
- Where ya comin' from?
- New York.

232
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,137
Well, New York. You're in luck this time.

233
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,139
I'm goin' all the way.

234
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,807
Right through to Los Angeles.

235
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,102
- You drive a car?
- Sure.

236
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:26,897
- Whenever you're tired, let me know.
- I'll holler.

237
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,776
I guess at least an hour passed
before I noticed

238
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,778
those deep scratches in his right hand.

239
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,696
They were wicked.

240
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,532
Three puffy red lines
about a quarter of an inch apart.

241
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,869
He must have seen me looking at them
because he said...

242
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,288
Beauties, aren't they?

243
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,957
They're gonna be scars someday.

244
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,002
What an animal.

245
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,880
Whatever it was, it must have been
pretty big and vicious to have done that.

246
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,424
Right on both counts, New York.

247
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:57,636
I was tussling with the most
dangerous animal in the world...

248
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,804
a woman.

249
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,014
She must have been Tarzan's mate.

250
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,766
Looks like you lost the bout.

251
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,559
Certainly wasn't a draw.

252
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:08,313
You know, there ought to be a law
against dames with claws.

253
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,314
Yeah.

254
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,483
I tossed her out of the car on her ear.

255
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:16,655
Was I wrong? Give a lift to a tomato,
you expect her to be nice, don't ya?

256
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:17,656
Yeah.

257
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,242
After all, what kind of dames thumb rides?

258
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,577
- Sunday school teachers?
- Yeah.

259
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,747
The little witch.

260
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,458
She must've thought she was riding
with some fall guy.

261
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,337
And me who's been booking horses
around racetracks since I was 20.

262
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,923
[scoffs] I've known a million dames like her.

263
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,217
- Two million.
- Yeah.

264
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,138
Stopped the car, opened the door...

265
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:44,641
"Take it on the Arthur Duffy, sister,"
I told her.

266
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:48,103
- That's the stuff.
- As I was down on her. [laughs]

267
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:52,148
But if you wanna see a real scar, brother,
get a load of this.

268
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,026
Wow.

269
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:57,904
- I got that one dueling.
- Dueling?

270
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,865
Yeah. We were just kidding, of course.

271
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,450
My dad owned a couple of
Franco-Prussian sabers.

272
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,244
Kept 'em on the wall for decorations.

273
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:09,749
One day, another kid and I took 'em down
when the old man wasn't around. Had a duel.

274
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:11,376
[chuckles]

275
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,587
He hit me in the arm, here.

276
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,338
Pretty mean cut.

277
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,965
Infection set in later.

278
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,842
Yeah, I can see that.

279
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,428
- Oh, gimme that box again, will ya?
- Yeah.

280
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,099
[pills rattling]

281
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,397
[glove box closes]

282
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,525
Pain made me lose my head, I guess.

283
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,694
I began slashing.

284
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,488
Before I knew it,
I put the other kid's eye out.

285
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:43,950
- That was tough.
- Well, it was just an accident, of course.

286
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:48,413
But you know how kids are. I got scared...
decided I was gonna run away from home.

287
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,958
Old man almost clocked me
when I was packin' my duds.

288
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:56,296
If the bloody rag I had wrapped around my wrist
hadn't caught his attention,

289
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,048
he'd have seen the bundle for sure.

290
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,551
But I beat it when he was phoning for a doctor.

291
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:06,598
That was 15, 16 years ago.
I haven't been home since.

292
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,729
Pull in there for a bite of something, huh?

293
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,481
[Al narrating] A bite of something.

294
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,066
Brother, was I hungry.

295
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:18,401
I hadn't had anything in my stomach for hours.

296
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,404
Yet even with that gnawing
in the pit of my belly,

297
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:24,324
I didn't want to be in too big a rush
to put on the feed bag.

298
00:21:25,076 --> 00:21:27,827
First, I had to make sure
this guy knew the score.

299
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:31,247
If I got him down on me,
it was good-bye ticket to Hollywood.

300
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,708
I'll wait out here for you, mister.

301
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,753
If it's the money, don't worry about
paying for it. This time it's on me.

302
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,255
- Well, that's white of you, Mr...
- Haskell. Think nothing of it.

303
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,717
You make your first million, maybe you can
do the same for me. Come on, New York.

304
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,594
I gotta make the West Coast by Wednesday.

305
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:47,263
There's a horse running at
Santa Anita named Paradisiacal.

306
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:49,933
- Means dough to me if I'm running.
- We'll make it all right.

307
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:54,688
[Al narrating] He did most of the talking
during the half hour we were in the place.

308
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:55,772
I ate.

309
00:21:56,857 --> 00:22:01,027
He rambled on about his old man, who he hadn't
heard from since he ran away as a kid,

310
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,946
and how he happened to become a bookie,

311
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,740
and then all about how he got rooked in Miami.

312
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,660
One race, 38 grand.
They cleaned out my book.

313
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:11,079
- How do you like that?
- That was tough luck.

314
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,164
Yeah, and I'm supposed to be the smart guy.

315
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:16,543
You just wait. I'm going back to Florida
next season with all kinds of jack.

316
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,586
And you watch those stinkers run for cover.

317
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:21,965
- Want anything else?
- No, thanks, I've had plenty.

318
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,556
- The check there, sister?
- Mm-hmm.

319
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,519
Oh, just a minute. Your change, sir.

320
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,272
- Keep it, sister.
- Oh, thank you, sir. Call again.

321
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,190
I'll be waitin' outside for you
when you finish work.

322
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,400
[chuckles]

323
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,776
Sharp chick, huh?

324
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,912
[Al narrating] I drove all that night
while Haskell slept like a log.

325
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:56,416
After a while, I began to get sleepy myself.

326
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:01,671
I was happy though.
Soon I'd be with Sue again.

327
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:03,214
The long trip was practically over,

328
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,009
and there'd be no more hoofing it
down the concrete.

329
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,928
I began to think of the future,

330
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:12,098
which couldn't have been brighter
if I'd embroidered it with neon lights.

331
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,226
It was nice to think of Sue shooting to the top.

332
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:20,356
[chuckles] It's amazing what a full belly
can do to your imagination.

333
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:23,276
[romantic ballad]

334
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,156
# Your eyes are blue
Your kisses too #

335
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,577
# I never knew what they could do #

336
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:39,667
# I can't believe that you're in love with me #

337
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:45,632
# You're telling everyone you know #

338
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:50,095
# I'm on your mind each place you go #

339
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:56,017
# I can't believe that you're in love #

340
00:23:56,352 --> 00:24:02,690
# With me #

341
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:12,951
Mr. Haskell.

342
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:15,703
Mr. Haskell?

343
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,875
Mr. Haskell, wake up! It's raining.

344
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,002
Don't you think we ought to stop
and put up the top?

345
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,263
Mr. Haskell, I'm gonna put up the top.

346
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:50,029
[Al narrating] Until then,
I'd done things my way.

347
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:52,699
But from then on, something else
stepped in and shunted me off

348
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:55,535
to a different destination
than the one I had picked for myself.

349
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:58,329
For when I pulled open that door...

350
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:05,170
Mr. Haskell, what's the matter?
Are you hurt?

351
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,547
Are you hurt, Mr. Haskell?

352
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,467
[Al narrating]
Start your sermon. I'll listen to it.

353
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:15,013
But I know what you're gonna hand me
even before you open your mouths.

354
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:18,016
You're gonna tell me you don't believe
my story of how Haskell died

355
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,352
and give me that "don't make me laugh"
expression on your smug faces.

356
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,357
I saw at once he was dead.

357
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,193
And I was in for it.

358
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,111
Who would believe he fell out of the car?

359
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,738
If Haskell came to, which,
of course, he couldn't,

360
00:25:31,822 --> 00:25:34,240
even he would swear
I conked him over the head for his dough.

361
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:35,491
Yes, I was in for it.

362
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:39,829
Instinct told me to run,
but then I realized it was hopeless.

363
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:41,998
There were lots of people back down the road
who could identify me.

364
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,000
That gas station guy and the waitress.

365
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:46,419
I would be in a worse spot then
trying to explain why I beat it.

366
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,381
The next possibility was to sit tight
and tell the truth when the cops came.

367
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:53,176
But that would be crazy.
They'd laugh at the truth.

368
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,552
And I'd have my head in a noose.

369
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,807
So what else was there to do
but hide the body and get away in the car?

370
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:02,101
I couldn't leave the car there
with him in the gully.

371
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:03,937
That would be like erecting a tombstone.

372
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:35,385
My idea was to cover him with brush,
not to rob him.

373
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:38,304
But then I remembered that even if
I only drove the car for 100 miles or so,

374
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:39,722
I would need money for gas.

375
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,060
Besides, it was stupid of me
to leave all that money on a dead man.

376
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,188
Not only that,
I'd have to take his driver's license

377
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:48,690
in case I was stopped for something.

378
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:52,235
I didn't like to think about it,

379
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,821
but by that time I'd done
just what the police would say I did.

380
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:57,740
Even if I didn't... My clothes.

381
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,618
The owner of such an expensive car
would never be wearing them.

382
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,246
Some cop might pull me in on suspicion.

383
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,802
[motorcycle approaches]

384
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,231
Hey, you. This your car?

385
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:33,943
Don't you know better than to leave a car
with the wheels halfway in the middle of the road?

386
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:35,403
That's the way accidents happen.

387
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:38,614
I... I'm sorry, Officer.
I was just putting up my top.

388
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:41,367
- I didn't think.
- Well, the next time, think.

389
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:43,911
I'll let you go now,
but watch your step in the future.

390
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,414
I know that it's a lonely stretch,
but cars come by here once in a while.

391
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,334
- We have plenty of crack-ups.
- Thanks, Officer.

392
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:15,777
[Al narrating] I left nothing in the car
that'd give me away as Roberts.

393
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:18,529
If they found a dead man in the gully now,
it could be me.

394
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,122
As I drove off, it was still raining.

395
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:31,876
The drops streaked
down the windshield like tears.

396
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,381
I kept imagining I was being followed,

397
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,341
that I could hear sirens
back in the distance.

398
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,471
Just how long it took to cover the 60-odd
miles to the California state line,

399
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,555
I don't know.

400
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,641
I lost all track of time.

401
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:51,270
But the rain had stopped and the sun was up
when I pulled up to the inspection station.

402
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:56,692

00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,946

- No.

- Any livestock or poultry?
- No.

and driver's license, please.

- Just baggage.

- Are you Charles Haskell Jr.?
- Yes.

411
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,263
Well, remember, if you're employed,
and you stay over 30 days,

412
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:27,223
you take out California plates.

413
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:29,517
All right, Officer, but I'll only be
in the state a short while.

414
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,270
Right. You can go now.

415
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,113

without some sleep.

I had to hit the hay and hit it hard.

00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,203

427

Who's there?

428
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:02,610
It's the maid. Can I come in and clean?

429
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,322
Later... in a half-hour.

430
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,490
All right, sir.

431
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,599
[Al narrating] There was no time to lose.

432
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:36,227
Every minute I had to be Charles Haskell
was dangerous.

433
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,521
I'd have to be Charles Haskell
until I got to some city

434
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,648
where I could leave the car
and be swallowed up.

435
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,864
That meant driving the car
as far as San Bernardino,

436
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:50,491
maybe even to Los Angeles.

437
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:52,451
In a little town, I might be noticed.

438
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:54,328
But in a city, I should be safe enough.

439
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:58,666
Then, after I ditched the car,
I could go on to Sue.

440
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:02,545
But those five minutes at the state line
made me realize

441
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,631
it might be a good idea to find out
a little bit about Mr. Haskell.

442
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:09,302
Then if anybody asked me questions,
I could give the right answers.

443
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:13,806
The first thing I found out
was that I had $768.

444
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:17,768
This was a lot of jack, but believe me,

445
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,895
it was the kind of money
I'd rather not have.

446
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:31,115
And then I found out from a letter
Haskell was carting around in his bag

447
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,784
that he wasn't the openhanded,
easygoing big shot

448
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:36,412
who went around buying dinners
for strange hitchhikers.

449
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,832
Before I got done reading it,
I saw him more as a chiseler.

450
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,836
It was written
to his old man in California,

451
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,796
the one he hadn't seen in so many years.

452
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:51,385
In it, Haskell posed as a salesman...
of hymnals, of all things.

453
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,388
It was easy to see where Haskell expected

454
00:32:54,473 --> 00:32:56,849
to raise a new stake
for his book in Miami...

455
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,143
by rooking his old man.

456
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:03,689
That was about all I found out
from his effects.

457
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:04,857
And it was enough.

458
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:09,737
I told myself maybe old man Haskell
was lucky his son kicked off.

459
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:12,531
He would never know it,

460
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:16,077
but it saved him from taking a flier
in sacred literature preferred.

[birds chirping]

462
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:43,979
Near the airport at Desert Center,
I pulled up for water.

463
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:46,691
There was a woman.

464
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,614
Hey, you. Come on if you want a ride.

00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:08,587
[car hood slams]

466
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:41,662
How far you goin'?

467
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,122
How far are you going?

468
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:46,792
[Al narrating] That took me by surprise.
I turned my head to look her over.

469
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,588
She was facing straight ahead,
so I couldn't see her eyes.

470
00:34:51,006 --> 00:34:53,758
But she was young, not more than 24.

471
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,844
Man, she looked as if
she'd just been thrown off

472
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,305
the crummiest freight train in the world.

473
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,641
Yet, in spite of this,
I got the impression of beauty.

474
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:06,020
Not the beauty of a movie actress,
mind you,

475
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,689
or the beauty you dream about
when you're with your wife,

476
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,065
but a natural beauty,

477
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:13,194
a beauty that's almost homely
because it's so real.

478
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:17,114
Then, suddenly, she turned to face me.

479
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:20,409
- How far did you say you were going?
- Los Angeles.

480
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:21,410
LA?

481
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:25,790
- LA's good enough for me, mister.
- That's what I was afraid of.

482
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:29,084
- What'd you say?
- Oh, nothing. Just thinking out loud.

483
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,128
People get in trouble for doing that.

484
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:34,715
- What's your name?
- You can call me Vera, if you like.

485
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:37,176
- You live in Los Angeles?
- No.

486
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:41,555
- Where you coming from?
- Oh, back there.

00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,098
- Needles?
- No.

488
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,102
Oh, sure. Phoenix.
You look just like a Phoenix girl.

489
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,855
- Are the girls in Phoenix that bad?
- [chuckles]

490
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,774
[Al narrating]
The girl must have been pretty tired

491
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:54,944
because she fell asleep not 20 minutes
after she stepped into the car.

492
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:59,782
She lay sprawled out with her head resting
against the far door, like Haskell.

493
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:03,452
I didn't like that part of it much,
but I didn't wake her up.

494
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:06,872
It wasn't that this girl still worried me.

495
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:10,376
I'd gotten over that funny feeling
I had when she looked at me,

496
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,003
which I put down
as just my jangled nerves.

497
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,590
With her eyes closed
and the tenseness gone out of her,

498
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,133
she seemed harmless enough.

499
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,929
Instead of disliking her,
I began to feel sorry for her.

500
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,182
The poor kid probably
had had a rough time of it.

501
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:27,977
Who was she, anyway?

502
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:30,479
And why was she going to Los Angeles?

503
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:32,898
And where'd she come from
in the first place?

504
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:34,775
The only thing I knew about her
was her name.

505
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,361
Not that it made any difference.

506
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,738
A few hours more and we'd be in Hollywood.

507
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:42,241
I'd forget where I parked the car
and look up Sue.

508
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:45,286
This nightmare of being a dead man
would be over.

509
00:36:46,121 --> 00:36:48,831
Who this dame was, well,
it was no business of mine.

510
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:52,918
Where did you leave his body?
Where did you leave the owner of this car?

511
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:54,712
You're not fooling anyone.

512
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:58,173
This buggy belongs to a guy named Haskell.
That's not you, mister.

513
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:01,343
You're out of your mind. That's my name.
Charles Haskell. I can prove it.

514
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:03,512
- Here's my driver's license.
- Save yourself the trouble, mister.

515
00:37:03,597 --> 00:37:05,848
Having Haskell's wallet
only makes it worse.

516
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,017
It just so happens
I rode with Charlie Haskell

517
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:09,685
all the way from Louisiana.

518
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,854
He picked me up outside of Shreveport.

519
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,564
- You rode...
- You heard me.

520
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:15,983
[Al narrating] Then it all came back to me.

521
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,652
All the talk about dueling
and scars and scratches.

522
00:37:19,613 --> 00:37:21,363
There was no doubt about it.

523
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:23,949
Vera must be the woman
Haskell had mentioned.

524
00:37:24,034 --> 00:37:25,784
She must have passed me while I slept.

525
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:28,871
Well? Well, I'm waiting.

526
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,331
My goose was cooked.

527
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,082
She had me.

528
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:34,668
That Haskell guy wasn't dead yet.

529
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,172
He wasn't stretched out stiff and cold
in any Arizona gully.

530
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,425
He was sitting right there in the car,
laughing like mad while he haunted me.

531
00:37:43,345 --> 00:37:44,303
Well?

532
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,514
There was nothing I could say.
It was her move.

533
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,142
Vera, whatever her name was.

534
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,478
It was just my luck
picking her up on the road.

535
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:56,148
It couldn't have been Helen
or Mary or Evelyn or Ruth.

536
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,526
It had to be the very last person
I should ever have met.

537
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,820
That's life.

538
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,491
Whichever way you turn,
fate sticks out a foot to trip you.

539
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:13,457
I told her everything,
but she didn't believe my story.

540
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,167
I should've saved my breath.

541
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,670
That's the greatest cock-and-bull story
I ever heard.

542
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,380
So he fell out of his car.

543
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:21,507
Say, who do you think
you're talking to, a hick?

544
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:23,592
Listen, mister. I've been around.

545
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:27,054
And I know a wrong guy when I see one.
What'd you do, kiss him with a wrench?

546
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,264
Now wait a minute.
What I told you was true.

547
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,891
You see, that's why I had to do it.

548
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:33,352
You think I killed him.
Well, the cops would've thought so too.

549
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,187
Yeah, well maybe they still think so.

550
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:38,482
What makes you so sure
I'll shut up about this?

551
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,318
Vera, I'm innocent.
Give me a break, will you?

552
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:44,488
It won't do me any good
having you pinched.

553
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,115
The cops are no friends of mine.

554
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,076
Now, if there was a reward...
But there isn't.

555
00:38:49,703 --> 00:38:51,912
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me yet.

556
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:55,332
I'm not through with you by a long shot.
Let's see that roll.

557
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,674
Is that all Haskell had?

558
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,509
- Isn't it enough?
- No, I thought he had more.

559
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,845
Not that I know of. You can search me
if you think I'm holding out on you.

560
00:39:07,929 --> 00:39:09,596
Well, maybe I will at that.

561
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,807
He told me he was gonna bet $3,000

562
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,560
on a horse named Paradisiacal
on Wednesday at Santa Anita.

563
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,979
- He was stringing you along. He meant 300.
- Maybe.

564
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:20,357
Sure. Three bucks, 300.
He was a piece of cheese, a big blowhard.

565
00:39:20,442 --> 00:39:23,277
Listen, mister. Don't try and tell me
anything about Charlie Haskell.

566
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,279
Remember, I knew him better than you did.

567
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:28,073
Okay, then you knew he was a four-flusher.
That explains the three-grand bet.

568
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:30,576
I'm not so sure
he didn't have that three grand.

569
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:34,121
Why should I believe you?
You got all the earmarks of a cheap crook.

570
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,622
- Now, wait a minute.
- Shut up.

571
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,207
You're a cheap crook and you killed him.

572
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:39,418
For two cents,
I'd change my mind and turn you in.

573
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:40,794
I don't like you!

574
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,338
- All right, all right. Don't get sore.
- I'm not getting sore.

575
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:45,507
But just remember who's boss around here.

576
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,134
If you shut up
and don't give me any arguments,

577
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,677
you'll have nothing to worry about.

578
00:39:48,762 --> 00:39:50,512
But if you act wise, well, mister,

579
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:53,182
you'll pop into jail so fast
it'll give you the bends.

580
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:55,059
- I'm not arguing.
- Well, see that you don't.

581
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,477
You know, as crooked as you look,

582
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:59,605
I'd hate to see a fella as young as you
wind up sniffing that perfume

583
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,482
that Arizona hands out free to murderers.

584
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,233
- I'm not a murderer.
- Of course you're not.

585
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:04,693
Haskell knocked his own head off.

586
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:06,278
He fell. That's how it happened,
just like I told you.

587
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,530
Sure, and then he made you a present
of his belongings.

588
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:10,324
- I explained why...
- Oh, skip it.

589
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,118
Doesn't make a difference one way
or another. I'm not a mourner.

590
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:15,412
I liked Haskell even less than I like you.

591
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,372
Yeah, I saw what you did to him.

592
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:19,541
- What do you mean?
- Those scratches on his wrists.

593
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:20,959
Sure, I scratched him.

594
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:23,128
I'll say you did.

595
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,673
So your idea was
to drive the car a little way,

596
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,967
maybe into San Bernardino,
and then leave it.

597
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:30,385
You weren't gonna sell it?

598
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,597
Sell it? You think I'm crazy?
Somebody else's car?

599
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,266
All I wanna do is leave it somewhere
and forget I ever saw it.

600
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:39,269
Not only don't you have any scruples,
you don't have any brains.

601
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:42,022
- I don't get you.
- Maybe it's a good thing you met me.

602
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:44,983
You would of got yourself caught, sure.
Why, you dope.

603
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:48,362
Don't you know a deserted automobile
always rates an investigation?

604
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,863
Huh?

605
00:40:49,948 --> 00:40:52,783
Look. The cops find a car.
Then they get curious.

606
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,493
They wonder where the owner is.

607
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:57,996
So, all right, they don't trace Haskell.
They trace you.

608
00:40:58,206 --> 00:40:59,790
I never thought of that.

609
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,626
The only safe way to get rid of the car
is to sell it to a dealer,

610
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,253
get it registered under a new name.

611
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:06,004
Say, stop at the next store.

612
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,882
I wanna get a bottle and do some shopping
before we hit LA.

613
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:12,219
Okay. Soon as we find a place,
I'll drop you off and pick you up later.

614
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,429
Nothin' doin'. You're coming in too.

615
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:17,349
From now on,
you and I are like the Siamese twins.

616
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,434
Have it your way,
but I don't get the point.

617
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,687
The point is I don't want you to get lost.

618
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:23,397
I'm not gonna beat it,
if that's what you're afraid of.

619
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,648
I'll say you're not.

620
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,568
Well, I'm gonna see that you sell this car
so you don't get caught.

621
00:41:27,652 --> 00:41:31,446
Thanks. Of course, your interest
wouldn't be financial, would it?

622
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:33,699
You wouldn't want
a small percentage of the profits?

623
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:37,202
Well, now that you insist,
how can I refuse?

624
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:38,912
A hundred percent'll do.

625
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,873
Fine. I'm relieved.

626
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:43,208
I thought for a moment
you were gonna take it all.

627
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:44,710
I don't want to be a hog.

628
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:48,672
[Al narrating] A few hours later,
we were in Hollywood.

629
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,466
I was recognizing places
Sue had written about.

630
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:55,012
It struck me that,
far from being at the end of the trip,

631
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:58,098
there was a greater distance between Sue
and me than when I started out.

632
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:02,060
Vera wasn't kidding
with that Siamese twins crack.

633
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:06,106
She rented a little apartment
as Mrs. Charles Haskell.

634
00:42:07,025 --> 00:42:10,110
When I objected to this, she explained
that it was on account of the car.

635
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:12,154
A dealer might think something was funny

636
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:14,531
if he called and found
we were using different names.

637
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:21,538
- Home, sweet home.
- Yeah.

638
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:23,498
Not bad, either.

639
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,842
In case there's any doubt in your mind,
I'll take the bedroom.

640
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:35,177
Yeah.

641
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:37,846
Sure is stuffy in here.

642
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,689
- Keep the window shut.
- Okay.

643
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:53,487
The old crow downstairs said
there's a folding bed behind this door.

644
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:00,702
You know how to work it?

645
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:05,540
I invented it.

646
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:11,630
- Some joint.
- One can't have everything.

647
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,387
I'm first in the bathtub.

648
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,140
I don't know why,
but I figured you would be.

649
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:35,570
Boy, oh, boy. [sighs]
It sure feels good to be clean again.

650
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:38,407
I must be ten pounds lighter.

651
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,450
You must be.

652
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:42,077
[saxophone playing]

653
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:45,372
Well, hitchin' rides isn't exactly the way
you keep your schoolgirl complexion.

654
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,712
I wish that guy with the sax
would give up.

655
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:54,423
It gets on my nerves.

656
00:43:56,509 --> 00:43:57,509
Forget it.

657
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:01,179
Have a drink.

658
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,141
Aren't you afraid
I'm gonna take you up on it?

659
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:08,562
If I didn't wanna give you a drink,
I wouldn't have offered it.

660
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:12,983
Why be a sorehead, Roberts?
You got yourself into this thing.

661
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,902
You should be grateful
I'm not turning you in.

662
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,114
Why, if I wasn't regular,
you'd be in the pen this minute

663
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:22,284
being photographed, fingerprinted,
and being pushed around by the cops.

664
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,620
So cheer up. Get rid of that long puss.

665
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:29,666
Or is your conscience bothering you?

666
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,505
No.

667
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,382
It isn't.

668
00:44:37,467 --> 00:44:39,468
Swell. That's the spirit.

669
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:43,180
He's dead,
and no moaning around will bring him back.

670
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:50,312
Anyway, I never could understand this worrying
about something that's over and done with.

671
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:52,439
Now look, Vera.
For the last time, I didn't kill him.

672
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,982
Haskell was a sick man.

673
00:44:54,067 --> 00:44:56,109
Maybe he was dead before he fell
out of the car. I don't know.

674
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:58,403
Sure, sure. He died of old age.

675
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:00,364
All right.

676
00:45:01,324 --> 00:45:02,824
So if it'll make you sociable...

677
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:05,827
you didn't kill him.

678
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:17,297
Thanks.

679
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,186
- We're outta liquor, Roberts.
- Yeah.

680
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:35,440
Too bad.
I felt like getting tight tonight.

681
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:37,567
Well, I think you succeeded.

682
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:40,737
- Am I tight?
- As a prima donna's corset.

683
00:45:40,822 --> 00:45:42,197
- That's good.
- [glass clatters]

684
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,074
I wanted to get tight.

685
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,785
Why? What have you got to get tight about?

686
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:49,246
Oh, I don't know. A few things.

687
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:50,956
[Al] Huh.

688
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,042
You should have my worries.

689
00:45:54,127 --> 00:45:56,670
If I had your troubles, I'd stay sober.

690
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,380
And I've got the key to that door.

691
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:04,678
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

692
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,388
I'm always right.

693
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,183
You know, I don't like your attitude,
Roberts.

694
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:12,018
Well, there's a lot of things I don't like.

695
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:14,813
Say...

696
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:19,276
But life's like a ball game.

697
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,111
You got to take a swing
at whatever comes along

698
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,613
before you wake up
and find it's the ninth inning.

699
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:25,782
Bet you read that somewhere.

700
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:29,703
That's the trouble with you, Roberts.
All you do is bellyache.

701
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:35,500
You could have taken it easy and,
well, try and make the best of things.

702
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:38,378
But maybe that's what's wrong
with the whole world.

703
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:40,297
Get the professor.

704
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:43,133
People knock themselves out
trying to buck fate.

705
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:46,386
Now take you, for instance.
You're lucky to be alive.

706
00:46:46,471 --> 00:46:49,055
Why, suppose Haskell had pulled open
your door?

707
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,850
You'd be playing a harp now.
Think of that.

708
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:56,855
You think of it. I'm tired of thinking.

709
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,816
There's plenty of people dying this minute

710
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:02,402
that would give anything
to trade places with you.

711
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,989
I know what I'm talking about.

712
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:10,744
I'm not so sure.
At least they know they're done for.

713
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,580
They don't just sweat blood
wondering if they are.

714
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,750
Your philosophy stinks, pal.

715
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:21,796
We all know we're gonna kick off someday.
It's only a question of when.

716
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:26,551
But what got us on this subject anyway?

717
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:28,553
We'll be discussing politics next.

718
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,472
Yeah.

719
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:33,433
Where'd you hide the butts?

720
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:35,936
On the table, sucker.

721
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:47,113
[Al narrating] We bored each other with
conversation for a couple of hours longer.

722
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:50,408
Every five minutes, one of us was wishing
we had another bottle or a radio

723
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:52,118
or something to read.

724
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:55,247
Then finally we ran out of chat.

725
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:57,499
I know it's only eleven o'clock,

726
00:47:57,583 --> 00:48:00,085
but I want to get up early
and make the rounds to the used car lots.

727
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:03,088
No hurry about that.
We got all the time in the world.

728
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:05,257
Maybe you have, but if you think
I want to stay cooped up in this place

729
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:06,925
any longer than I have to, you're batty.

730
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:10,262
It's not a bad place. Pay plenty
for diggings like this in New York.

731
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:12,347
I wouldn't like it if it was the Ritz.

732
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,849
[coughs]

733
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,144
Rotten liquor. [coughs]

734
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,981
You got a mean cough.
Ought to do something about it.

735
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:22,315
I'll be all right.

736
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,817
That's what Camille said.

737
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:25,652
Who?

738
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,195
Nobody you know.

739
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:33,368
- Wasn't that the dame that died of consumption?
- Yeah.

740
00:48:34,704 --> 00:48:37,289
Wouldn't it be a break for you
if I did kick off.

741
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:40,333
You'd be free
with all Haskell's dough and car.

742
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:42,043
I don't want to see anybody die.

743
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:44,921
Not even me?

744
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:48,008
Especially not you. One person died on me.

745
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:50,510
If you did, well, that's all I need.

746
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:54,222
You don't like me, do you, Roberts?

747
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:56,975
Like you?

748
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,769
I love you.

749
00:49:01,022 --> 00:49:02,981
My favorite sport is being kept prisoner.

750
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:07,485
After we sell the car, you can go to blazes
for all I care, but not until then.

751
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,536
I'm going to bed.

752
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,463
Good night, Roberts.

753
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:29,549
Don't try and sneak away during the night.
All the doors are locked.

754
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:33,136
Anyway, if I find you gone in the morning,
I'll notify the police.

755
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,889
- They'll pick you up.
- Don't worry. I know when I'm in a spot.

756
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:40,935
Well, good night. I hope that portable
rack isn't too uncomfortable for you.

757
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:43,146
Don't lose any sleep over it,
will you, Vera?

758
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:47,025
[key scratching lock]

759
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:21,935
[softly] CRestview...

760
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:29,651
6... 5... 7,

761
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:32,654
[whispers] 2... 3.

762
00:50:33,948 --> 00:50:35,073
Hello?

763
00:50:36,117 --> 00:50:37,117
Hello!

764
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:39,411
Hello?

765
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,746
Hello?

766
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:51,881
No. Not yet, darling.

767
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:54,509
Tomorrow.

768
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:56,928
Maybe.

769
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:01,891
[Al narrating] if this were fiction,

770
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:05,562
I would fall in love with her, marry her,
and make a respectable woman of her,

771
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:09,816
or else she'd make some supreme,
class-A sacrifice for me and die.

772
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:13,361
Sue and I would ball a little
over her grave

773
00:51:13,446 --> 00:51:16,448
and make some crack about
"there's good in all of us."

774
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:20,160
But Vera, unfortunately,
was just as rotten in the morning

775
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:21,870
as she'd been the night before.

776
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:23,455
[knocking]

777
00:51:23,539 --> 00:51:25,415
All right, all right, I'm coming.

778
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,459
[Al] Look, Vera, it's almost noon.

779
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:31,254
So what?
The dealers will be there all day.

780
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,007
They'll be there all year too, but it
doesn't mean I'm gonna wait that long.

781
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,551
Shut up.
You're making noises like a husband.

782
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:42,932
- Well, do I rate a whistle?
- You sure do, but let's go.

783
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:46,519
Let's go, let's go. I spend 85 bucks
and two hours preparing bait,

784
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:48,188
and all you can say is "Let's go."

785
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:51,274
[sighs] Come on.

786
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:58,698
We passed a few used car lots
last night down this way.

787
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:00,784
What do you think
we can get for this heap?

788
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:04,496
I don't know. Plenty.
You just let me handle everything.

789
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,206
You think we can get $2,000?

790
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:07,707
I don't know. But don't worry.

791
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:10,126
I'll squeeze as much
out of this guy as I can.

792
00:52:10,211 --> 00:52:13,296
If I let it go cheap without a fight,
he might think we've stolen the car.

793
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,675
And listen, don't make any slips
and call me Roberts. That'll cook us.

794
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,636
I don't need you to tell me that.

795
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,930
You better just sit by
and keep your mouth closed.

796
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:24,015
Remember, we're both in the soup
if anything happens.

797
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,642
Forget it and drive.

798
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:28,144
You're my wife... Vera Haskell.

799
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:32,315
Look, after the deal's closed, let's go
back to that place on Hollywood Boulevard

800
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:33,942
where I saw the fur jacket.

801
00:52:34,026 --> 00:52:35,235
I want to buy it.

802
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:37,987
After the deal's closed,
I'm saying good-bye to you.

803
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:41,491
That's right. I forgot.
I guess I'm getting kind of used to you.

804
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:45,036
Well, that's a habit
you can start breaking.

805
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,455
Let's try this place
in the middle of the block.

806
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,129
Good afternoon. What can I do for you?

807
00:52:55,214 --> 00:52:58,508
- We're interested in selling a car.
- If the price is right.

808
00:53:01,387 --> 00:53:05,473
Well, if it's in good mechanical condition,
it should blue book for about 1,600.

809
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:07,892
Tony, take a look at this motor.

810
00:53:07,977 --> 00:53:10,228
1,600. Are you kidding?

811
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:15,900
[car hood opening]

812
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,283
Well, maybe 1,850.

813
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:26,744
Before I let it go for 1,850, I'll wreck it
and collect the insurance first.

814
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:27,912
[coughs]

815
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:33,376
Lady, this motor's seen a lot of driving.

816
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:43,219
[Al narrating] While the mechanic
inspected the car, we haggled.

817
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:46,973
At last, when we were all worn out,
we hit a compromise...

818
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,600
his price.

819
00:53:51,896 --> 00:53:53,104
Okay, it's a deal.

820
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:56,524
- Come in, we'll sign the papers.
- I have the ownership papers here with me.

821
00:53:56,609 --> 00:53:59,319
Look, Vera, in the meantime,
will you clean out the dash compartment?

822
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:02,196
- There may be some stuff in it.
- All right, darling.

823
00:54:04,325 --> 00:54:06,534
1,850 bucks.

824
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:08,244
That dirty cr...

825
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:17,420
- Mm, New York, huh?
- Yeah.

826
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:20,757
- But you bought the car in Miami?
- Yeah.

827
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:22,467
Well, now, let's see about the insurance.

828
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:24,552
We can either have it transferred
or canceled.

829
00:54:24,637 --> 00:54:27,263
Uh, what kind of insurance do you have,
Mr. Haskell?

830
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:31,559
Well, uh, aren't all the papers there?

831
00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:37,857
I don't see any. Surely you know what type
of insurance you carry on the car.

832
00:54:37,942 --> 00:54:39,442
The name of the company?

833
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:41,486
Yeah, but, uh...

834
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:43,321
Well, if you'll just tell me
the name of the company,

835
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,114
I'd be very glad to take care
of all the details.

836
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:46,324
Well...

837
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,409
- Did you sign the papers yet?
- Not yet.

838
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:50,536
Well, don't. We're not selling the car.

839
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:52,538
- Well, wait a minute, Mrs. Haskell...
- Come on, darling.

840
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:55,917
- What's the matter? Change your mind?
- Yes. I'm sorry. I guess I have.

841
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,377
- But, Vera...
- Let's go.

842
00:55:03,384 --> 00:55:06,636
You got me out of a tight spot, Vera,
but I still don't understand all this.

843
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,722
You will in a minute.
I almost threw away a gold mine.

844
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:13,726
1,850 isn't to be sneezed at. The car
doesn't book for as much as I thought.

845
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:15,478
We're not selling the car.

846
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,438
You want to keep it?
Now wait a minute, Vera.

847
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:20,608
You said yourself I wouldn't be safe
until the car was in someone else's name.

848
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:22,360
I'd like to be free of this mess
when I go.

849
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,612
That's just it, Roberts. You're not going.

850
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:27,365
- [sighs]
- There's a drive-in at the next corner.

851
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:30,201
Pull in there and we'll get a bite to eat
and I'll explain.

852
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:32,453
What is this,
another one of your brilliant ideas?

853
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:41,671
- Hello. May I take your order?
- Make mine a ham sandwich and coffee.

854
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:44,340
- And for you, sir?
- Oh, I don't care. The same.

855
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,719
Thank you.

856
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:55,226
Get this, Vera,
I've been pretty patient so far.

857
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,311
I've done everything you asked me to do,
but no more.

858
00:55:57,396 --> 00:55:59,564
- Shut up.
- You've taken Haskell's money.

859
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:01,524
And you can have the dough we get
from selling the car,

860
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,192
but you're not gonna keep me a prisoner.

861
00:56:03,277 --> 00:56:05,069
It's a good thing I bought the paper.
Look at that.

862
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:07,030
- Vera, I'm in no mood...
- Read that.

863
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,292
- No.
- Yes.

864
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,960
- No, I won't do it.
- Yes, you will.

865
00:56:21,045 --> 00:56:23,254
You think I'm crazy.
It's impossible, I tell ya.

866
00:56:24,131 --> 00:56:25,173
Excuse me.

867
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,138
Blow the horn when you're through.

868
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:38,561
No one could possibly get away with an act
like that. Be wise to me in a minute.

869
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:39,812
Don't be yellow.

870
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:42,690
You look enough like him.
The same coloring and the same build.

871
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:44,358
See how his clothes fit ya?

872
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:46,235
No kidding. You almost
had me fooled for a while.

873
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,528
Oh, grow up, Vera.

874
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:50,406
Don't you think a father knows his own
son? There must be other relatives.

875
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:53,326
The father won't have to know ya.
We'll wait till he gives up the ghost.

876
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,411
He's an old geezer
and he won't pull through.

877
00:56:55,496 --> 00:56:59,373
And as far as the relatives are concerned,
they haven't seen you in 15 or 20 years.

878
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:02,585
- Eat.
- I'm not hungry.

879
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:06,130
- And I won't do it.
- It's not as tough as it sounds.

880
00:57:06,215 --> 00:57:08,049
Remember, you've got
all kinds of identification...

881
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,133
his car, letters, license...

882
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:11,761
I could never get away with it.
It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

883
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,888
The old boy has scads of dough.

884
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:17,141
Look in the paper there. Personal fortune
assessed at over 15 million.

885
00:57:17,226 --> 00:57:18,684
He'll leave plenty, I tell ya.

886
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:20,937
Maybe he cut off his son.
How do we know?

887
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:23,606
It's out, Vera.
I won't have anything to do with it.

888
00:57:24,817 --> 00:57:27,068
I think you will.

889
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:30,696
Look, Vera, I'll do anything
within reason, but not that.

890
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,698
So forget it or find yourself another stooge.

891
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:34,033
You sap!

892
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:36,911
You'll be fixed for the rest of your life
as Charlie Haskell.

893
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:40,081
You can take your inheritance and go away.
No more worrying about the rent.

894
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,291
No sweating, scheming, wondering
where your next meal's coming from!

895
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:43,417
Think about that, Roberts!

896
00:57:43,502 --> 00:57:46,295
Vera, please. You're talking too loud.

897
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:49,298
On this I'm splitting 50-50 with you.
Sure, why not?

898
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:51,050
We're both alike.
Both born in the same gutter.

899
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:52,301
Now take it easy, Vera.

900
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:54,637
There's people around here.
You don't know what you're talking...

901
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:59,684
We'll wait till we read that old man
Haskell's dead. Then you show up.

902
00:57:59,768 --> 00:58:02,061
Like you read in New York
that he was sick.

903
00:58:02,146 --> 00:58:04,772
No! Suppose he doesn't die?

904
00:58:04,857 --> 00:58:06,941
He will. I know he will.
Something tells me.

905
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:12,405
[Al narrating] But as much as I insisted
I would have no part of her scheme,

906
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,448
Vera was taking it for granted I would.

907
00:58:16,535 --> 00:58:19,954
Neither of us had our mind on the cards
as we played that night.

908
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:23,207
I knew we were just trying to kill time
between newspaper editions.

909
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:26,002
This was a deathwatch for Vera.

910
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:28,713
Maybe it was for me too.

911
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:32,383
Don't you realize if I'm caught they'll want
to know where I got the car and stuff?

912
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,595
- Then they'll have me on a murder charge.
- If you're smart, you won't get caught.

913
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:37,054
I knock with seven.

914
00:58:37,139 --> 00:58:39,348
And if I'm caught,
don't you realize you'll be out too?

915
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:42,935
Eighteen points. That gives me 30.

916
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:45,438
How will I be out?

917
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,982
You'll be out $1,850 we would have gotten
on the car.

918
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,483
Really, Vera, you'd be an awful chump

919
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:51,569
if you threw away all that dough
on a dizzy long shot.

920
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:52,904
Let me sell the bus tomorrow.

921
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:54,655
With the money it'll bring
and what you've already got,

922
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,449
a clever kid like you
can run it up in no time.

923
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:59,035
- Then we'd both be in the clear.
- I'll be in the clear anyway.

924
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,912
Maybe. Maybe.

925
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:02,580
But if I got caught...

926
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,083
- I'd get good and sore at you, you know.
- You mean you'd squeal?

927
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:08,377
- Well, no, not squeal exactly...
- Never mind what you meant!

928
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:14,425
Even if you did tell the cops
I was in on it with you,

929
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:15,885
what could they do to me?

930
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:19,347
They might give me the same medicine
they gave you.

931
00:59:19,431 --> 00:59:21,140
- Yeah.
- A rope.

932
00:59:23,644 --> 00:59:25,770
But I'm on my way anyhow.

933
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:29,732
All they'll be doing will be rushing it.

934
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:32,818
All right. But think of the 1,850 you'd lose.

935
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:35,655
You'd kick yourself along the block
if you let that get away from you.

936
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:38,658
I'll take the chance. Want another drink?

937
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:41,744
You're being a goon. That's the way
people wind up behind the eight ball.

938
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:44,330
Once they get a few dollars,
they become greedy and want more.

939
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:45,706
My, my.

940
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,791
- Caesar.
- Who?

941
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:49,585
You know, that Roman general?
He got his for being greedy.

942
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:52,838
He wasn't satisfied.
So the final windup was he took the count.

943
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:55,299
A couple of days ago you didn't have a dime.

944
00:59:55,384 --> 00:59:58,219
Why, you were so broke
you couldn't pay cash for a postage stamp.

945
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:01,347
Now you've got almost $700,
with 1,850 in the offing.

946
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,099
Take my advice. Don't try for more.

947
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:05,768
I'm tired of this game.
Let's have some blackjack.

948
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:06,686
Play solitaire.

949
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,313
- I will, if that's the way you feel about it.
- That's the way I feel about it.

950
01:00:09,398 --> 01:00:11,607
Getting sore and throwing things
won't help much, Roberts.

951
01:00:11,692 --> 01:00:15,111
I'm merely doing you a favor. I help you out of
a jam by keepin' my mouth shut.

952
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:18,072
I show you how to make some soft money,
and what thanks do I get?

953
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,156
- Thanks?
- Sure.

954
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:21,659
Or would you rather I called the cops and told
them you killed a man and stole his money?

955
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:22,827
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Yes, you did.

956
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,705
- No, I didn't. You know I didn't.
- All right, then.

957
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:30,251
Suppose I call the cops?

958
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,920
If you're innocent,
what do you got to be scared of?

959
01:00:33,005 --> 01:00:36,590
Okay, call 'em, you mutt. Go ahead and call 'em.
See if I care.

960
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:39,552
- At least they'll give me a square deal.
- You want me to call 'em?

961
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:43,597
You heard me. But I'm warning ya.
If I'm pinched, I'll swear you were in on it.

962
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:46,976
I'll say that you helped me.
If I'm frying, I'll get even with you.

963
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,686
You wouldn't dare. You're chicken!

964
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:52,815
Yeah? Then try it and see.
Call 'em. Yeah.

965
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,067
Okay, I will.

966
01:00:57,112 --> 01:01:00,489
[dialing]

967
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:09,915
Information.

968
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,835
I want the number
of the Hollywood police station.

969
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:16,756
Okay, I got it. Thanks.

970
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:19,592
[phone hook clicks]

971
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,677
- [dialing]
- Wait a minute, Vera. You wouldn't do that.

972
01:01:21,762 --> 01:01:23,721
Oh, wouldn't I? Give me that
and I'll show you if I would!

973
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,681
Take it easy now. Let's talk this over.

974
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:27,558
[Al narrating]
This was early in the evening.

975
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:32,146
And the conversation, while hectic,
was at least pitched low.

976
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:36,776
But as the minutes passed and more obstacles
to her plan popped into my head,

977
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,486
the air got blue.

978
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:41,822
Each word coming from our lips
cracked like a whip.

979
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:45,785
I reminded her that as Charles Haskell
I didn't even know my mother's name,

980
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:47,578
where I'd gone to school,

981
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,413
the name of my best friend,

982
01:01:49,498 --> 01:01:51,415
whether I had an Aunt Emma or not,

983
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:54,794
my religion, and if I'd ever owned a dog.

984
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:57,463
I didn't even know
what my middle initial stood for.

985
01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:00,925
I also pointed out that the real Haskell
had a scar on his forearm.

986
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:03,302
His people never saw that scar.

987
01:02:03,387 --> 01:02:05,596
He told me he ran away
right after putting out the kid's eye.

988
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,140
Yeah, but his father knew he was cut.
There'd have to be some kind of mark.

989
01:02:08,225 --> 01:02:10,434
So what?

990
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:14,438
The old man's dead or will be.
I hope by tomorrow morning's papers.

991
01:02:14,523 --> 01:02:18,025
Anyway, you could cut yourself
a little, couldn't ya?

992
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:22,321
Boy, for that kind of dough,
I'd let you cut my leg off.

993
01:02:22,406 --> 01:02:23,989
You're drunk and you're crazy mad, Vera.

994
01:02:24,074 --> 01:02:26,033
Turn me in if you want to,
but I won't get mixed up in this.

995
01:02:26,118 --> 01:02:28,160
Besides, how do we know?
Haskell was such a phony.

996
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:30,371
Maybe he wasn't the man's son at all.
Maybe he just dreamed it up.

997
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:35,918
Well, dreaming or not, you won't be dreaming
when the law taps you on the shoulder.

998
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:39,588
There's a cute little gas chamber
waiting for you, Roberts.

999
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:43,134
And I hear extradition to Arizona's a cinch.

1000
01:02:43,218 --> 01:02:45,052
Where's that phone?

1001
01:02:45,137 --> 01:02:46,512
- Vera.
- Leave me alone!

1002
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:50,057
- Vera!
- I wanna phone, call the police.

1003
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:54,812
I hate you, you stinker.
You leave me alone!

1004
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:57,106
I'll let you alone when you promise to leave
the phone where it is.

1005
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:59,150
- You're drunk. You don't know what you're doing.
- You're hurting me.

1006
01:02:59,234 --> 01:03:00,860
Will you promise?

1007
01:03:00,944 --> 01:03:02,528
All right.

1008
01:03:07,492 --> 01:03:10,327
- You hurt me.
- I'm sorry, but...

1009
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:13,372
- And it's hot in here! Open up a window!
- It's not hot!

1010
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:16,125
Don't tell me!
Now do you do it or do I do it?

1011
01:03:18,086 --> 01:03:19,837
You're no gentleman, see?

1012
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:23,299
Yeah. All right, I'll open up the window.

1013
01:03:26,428 --> 01:03:27,511
Vera!

1014
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:34,643
Vera, open the door.
Please open the door.

1015
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:36,854
Vera, open the door.
Don't use the phone. Listen to me.

1016
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:40,983
I don't like you, Roberts.
You're no gentleman, see?

1017
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:45,154
You hurt my hand,
and I'm gonna get even with you.

1018
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:48,407
If you don't open the door,
I'm gonna kick it down, Vera.

1019
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:51,368
Vera, don't call the cops.
Listen to me, I'll do anything you say.

1020
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:53,746
Vera, let me in!

1021
01:03:55,207 --> 01:03:56,665
I'll break the phone!

1022
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:17,269
[grunting]

1023
01:04:22,609 --> 01:04:23,943
Vera.

1024
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:36,539
[Al narrating] The world is full of skeptics.

1025
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,667
I know. I'm one myself.

1026
01:04:40,669 --> 01:04:43,712
In the Haskell business, how many of you
would believe he fell out of the car?

1027
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:46,173
And now, after killing Vera
without really meaning to do it,

1028
01:04:46,258 --> 01:04:48,676
how many of you would believe
it wasn't premeditated?

1029
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:53,264
In a jury room, every last man of you
would go down shouting

1030
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:56,058
that she had me over a barrel
and my only out was force.

1031
01:04:58,103 --> 01:04:59,728
The room was still.

1032
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:03,691
So quiet that for a while I'd wondered
if I'd suddenly gone deaf.

1033
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:06,235
It was pure fear, of course.

1034
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,195
And I was hysterical,

1035
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,989
but without making a sound.

1036
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:14,285
Vera was dead, and I was her murderer.

1037
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:19,873
Murderer. What an awful word that is.
But I'd become one.

1038
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:22,042
I'd better not get caught.

1039
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:24,628
What evidence there was around the place
had to be destroyed.

1040
01:05:24,713 --> 01:05:26,505
And from the looks of things, there was plenty.

1041
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:28,299
Looking around the room at things we'd bought

1042
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:30,801
was like looking into the faces of
a hundred people who'd seen us together

1043
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:32,803
and who remembered me.

1044
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:35,306
This was the kind of testimony
I couldn't rub out.

1045
01:05:36,808 --> 01:05:38,058
No.

1046
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:41,312
I could burn clothes and hide bottles
for the next five years.

1047
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:42,855
There'd always be witnesses.

1048
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,732
The landlady for one.
She could identify me.

1049
01:05:44,816 --> 01:05:46,233
The car dealer, the waitress in the drive-in,

1050
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:48,819
the girl in the dress shop,
and that guy in the liquor store.

1051
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:50,696
They could all identify me.

1052
01:05:52,032 --> 01:05:55,868
I was cooked. Done for.
I had to get out of there.

1053
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:59,330
While once I remained beside a dead body

1054
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:02,416
planning carefully how to avoid
being accused of killing him,

1055
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,752
this time I couldn't.

1056
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:06,503
This time I was guilty.

1057
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:09,923
I knew it. Felt it.

1058
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,218
I was like a guy suffering from shock.

1059
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:14,970
Things were whirling around in my head.

1060
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:17,890
I couldn't make myself think right.

1061
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:21,435
All I could think of was the guy with
the saxophone and what he was playing.

1062
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:24,021
It wasn't a love song anymore.

1063
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,565
It was a dirge.

1064
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:14,113
[jukebox: up-tempo band music]

1065
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:16,615
[Al narrating]
But my problems weren't solved.

1066
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:19,493
I had to stay away from New York
for all time.

1067
01:07:20,328 --> 01:07:23,622
Because Al Roberts was listed as dead
and had to stay dead.

1068
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:25,999
And I could never go back to Hollywood.

1069
01:07:26,835 --> 01:07:28,794
Someone might recognize me as Haskell.

1070
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:33,048
- Then, too, there was Sue.
- [music stops]

1071
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:37,803
I could never go to her with a thing
like this hanging over my head.

1072
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:42,474
All I could do was pray she'd be happy.

1073
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:57,656
I was in Bakersfield before I read
that Vera's body was discovered.

1074
01:07:57,741 --> 01:08:01,368
And that the police were looking for Haskell
in connection with his wife's murder.

1075
01:08:02,871 --> 01:08:04,413
Isn't that a laugh?

1076
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:09,001
Haskell got me into this mess
and Haskell was getting me out of it.

1077
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:11,170
The police were searching for a dead man.

1078
01:08:14,674 --> 01:08:16,884
I keep trying to forget what happened...

1079
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:22,973
and wonder what my life might have been
if that car of Haskell's hadn't stopped.

1080
01:08:24,768 --> 01:08:26,935
But one thing I don't have to wonder about.

1081
01:08:28,146 --> 01:08:29,605
I know.

1082
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:34,234
Someday a car will stop to pick me up
that I never thumbed.

1083
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:39,865
Yes.

1084
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:44,411
Fate... or some mysterious force

1085
01:08:44,496 --> 01:08:47,414
can put the finger on you or me

1086
01:08:47,499 --> 01:08:49,500
for no good reason at all.
