Well Mrs Flaherty, how's business?

35
00:03:58,093 --> 00:04:00,120
As good as new. We get a nice crowd.

36
00:04:00,476 --> 00:04:02,064
Our dinner trade is awful slow though.

37
00:04:02,246 --> 00:04:03,934
It will pick up.
- Of course it will.

38
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,856
If I do say so myself,
we set a fine table.

39
00:04:07,276 --> 00:04:08,721
You ought to come over some time.

40
00:04:08,923 --> 00:04:10,182
I will. Next week maybe.

41
00:04:11,132 --> 00:04:12,081
Excuse me.

42
00:04:13,014 --> 00:04:13,868
Fred.

43
00:04:21,644 --> 00:04:23,232
That's one of them alright.
- Thanks.

44
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:25,062
Is something wrong?

45
00:04:25,353 --> 00:04:27,428
Mrs Flaherty, do you remember
where you got that bill?

46
00:04:27,528 --> 00:04:28,449
The twenty?

47
00:04:29,032 --> 00:04:32,083
Around noon. In the rush
hour. I was very busy.

48
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:34,861
A young, dark fellow with a mustache.

49
00:04:35,788 --> 00:04:37,775
It's good isn't it?
- It's counterfeit.

50
00:04:38,172 --> 00:04:39,016
Counterfeit?

51
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,748
You should watch for these things.
Especially in a bill of this size.

52
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:43,825
I've got to turn this in
to the Secret Service.

53
00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:46,081
I can have it back, can't I?
- I'm afraid not.

54
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:47,877
You are just down twenty dollars.

55
00:04:48,307 --> 00:04:51,999
But I can't afford it. I don't see how
they can expect me to take this loss.

56
00:04:52,582 --> 00:04:55,326
People who handle money have to
learn to spot the bad when they see it.

57
00:04:55,565 --> 00:04:57,667
It's their only protection.
I'm awfully sorry.

58
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,101
"<i>Mrs Flaherty's bill was sent to the
Secret Service Laboratory, Washington</i>."

59
00:05:11,637 --> 00:05:15,019
"<i>Here, counterfeit bills are analyzed
for distinctive characteristics</i>."

60
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:18,023

61
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,497
"<i>Had some very distinctive and
rather familiar characteristics</i>."

62
00:05:33,028 --> 00:05:34,335
Remember this note, Chief?

63
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,681
Yes .. the old Stewart note.

64
00:05:40,097 --> 00:05:42,099
No. Don't tell me this has
come out of retirement?

65
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:44,565
Yes. After three years. A new crop, too.

66
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:47,921
A million of these phonies floating
around isn't a happy idea, is it.

67
00:05:48,437 --> 00:05:50,504
It's fresh alright. Almost perfect.

68
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:52,836
You think Stewart would know about this?
- He might.

69
00:05:53,944 --> 00:05:55,236
He didn't have the plates.

70
00:05:55,739 --> 00:05:57,414
We knew that when he took the rap.

71
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,821
That case was a heart-breaker.

72
00:06:00,313 --> 00:06:02,931
It will break your heart again if they
flood the country with this stuff.

73
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:04,963
Why don't you drop in
on him? He might talk.

74
00:06:05,414 --> 00:06:09,141
His address is still Atlanta.
- Why not? We haven't any choice.

75
00:06:18,364 --> 00:06:20,324
Stewart hasn't got such a
bad record here, has he?

76
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:22,365
Very good. A model prisoner.

77
00:06:22,711 --> 00:06:24,806
He's too sharp to break any small rules.

78
00:06:25,527 --> 00:06:26,694
I'll talk to him now.

79
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,389
Bring Stewart in.
- "<i>Yes, sir</i>."

80
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,981
He's got another seven years to go.

81
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:37,306
He'll be out in four and
a half with his good time.

82
00:06:45,335 --> 00:06:46,410
That's all, Guard.

83
00:06:47,748 --> 00:06:48,688
Stewart.

84
00:06:49,129 --> 00:06:51,486
This is Mr Raymond of the
United States Secret Service.

85
00:06:53,025 --> 00:06:54,527
You don't seem very glad to see me.

86
00:06:55,277 --> 00:06:57,008
Sit down. Mr Raymond
wants to talk to you.

87
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:04,722
Familiar?

88
00:07:05,698 --> 00:07:07,200
What would I do with money in here?

89
00:07:07,476 --> 00:07:08,356
Look at it.

90
00:07:09,315 --> 00:07:10,590
A twenty-dollar bill.

91
00:07:11,286 --> 00:07:13,961
A couple of bets, or a ten-dollar win.
Or a tip to the cigarette girl.

92
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,542
Ah, Stewart .. don't snub an old friend.

93
00:07:18,236 --> 00:07:22,652
At your arrest, you had $50,000 of those
twenties, all phony, in your possession.

94
00:07:23,347 --> 00:07:24,089
I did?

95
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:26,449
Just because you got caught,
don't get sore at the money.

96
00:07:27,332 --> 00:07:29,986
I'm not sore.
- Okay, but it so happens that we are.

97
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:32,421
The bills are popping
up again, mostly out west.

98
00:07:32,521 --> 00:07:34,583
Frisco, Reno, Vegas and L.A.
- It wasn't me.

99
00:07:34,903 --> 00:07:36,296
I don't think so. Come again.

100
00:07:37,138 --> 00:07:39,563
Maybe you figure .. I've been
floating them out the window.

101
00:07:39,663 --> 00:07:41,390
Don't kid with me. You know what I mean.

102
00:07:41,686 --> 00:07:43,944
Somebody has got those plates
and is circulating the money.

103
00:07:44,316 --> 00:07:48,021
You might know who that somebody is.
- I don't get around socially anymore.

104
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:50,739
Stewart, you've got
seven more years to go.

105
00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:53,227
A little cooperation
might cut that down.

106
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,457
It might even get you a
recommendation for an early parole.

107
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,422
Stoolpigeons don't
live long, Mr Raymond.

108
00:07:58,522 --> 00:08:01,943
I don't expect you to be a stoolpigeon.
I'm asking you to be loyal to yourself.

109
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,849
To think of your own welfare.

110
00:08:04,739 --> 00:08:07,047
The mob is in action again,
but what are they doing for you?

111
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,182
Nothing.

112
00:08:08,535 --> 00:08:11,431
What are you doing for them?
Seven more years.

113
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,975
Who's printing that counterfeit money?

114
00:08:18,075 --> 00:08:20,648
I didn't know then and I don't know now.
- Who was your contact man?

115
00:08:21,974 --> 00:08:23,663
He was a guy named .. Joe.

116
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,966
He always wore dark glasses and had
his hat pulled down low over his face.

117
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:29,637
If he had a face I never saw it.

118
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,382
I guess I couldn't really tell
you what he looked like.

119
00:08:33,272 --> 00:08:34,688
Is that all you have to tell me?

120
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,896
Stewart, I guess I owe you an apology.

121
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:41,831
For interrupting your routine and
dragging you into the Warden's office.

122
00:08:42,253 --> 00:08:44,966
I misjudged you completely.
You must really like it here.

123
00:08:45,332 --> 00:08:48,688
You like it well enough to consider it
home-sweet-home for the next 7 years.

124
00:08:49,722 --> 00:08:50,680
Alright, Warden.

125
00:08:51,877 --> 00:08:53,675
Think of the next 7 years, Stewart.

126
00:08:54,006 --> 00:08:55,431
Try to refresh your memory.

127
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,055
Come on, Stewart.

128
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,244
What do you think?

129
00:09:03,694 --> 00:09:05,086
Oh, I think he'll come around.

130
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:17,527
"<i>One week later, on a
Federal district court order</i>."

131
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,335
"<i>Tris Stewart was being
transferred to Kansas City</i> .."

132
00:09:20,532 --> 00:09:23,283
"<i>In the custody of the
U.S. Deputy Marshals</i>."

133
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:25,746
No rest for the wicked.

134
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,315
I'm doing alright.

135
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:33,282
Do you mind raising your flipper?

136
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:37,806
It's central time now.

137
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,376
We've gained an hour.
- Yeah?

138
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:42,377
I can sure use it.

139
00:10:22,394 --> 00:10:23,717
Alright, unlock the jewelry.

140
00:10:32,261 --> 00:10:33,057
Get up.

141
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,932
Get up.

142
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:50,958
Pull her up and stop.

143
00:10:52,557 --> 00:10:54,151
Go easy on those brakes.

144
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,871
What you waiting for? Open the door.

145
00:11:40,745 --> 00:11:41,856
The gun is empty.

146
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:45,411
Hand it over.

147
00:11:46,297 --> 00:11:48,314
Come on, give me.
- Afraid I'm going to hurt myself?

148
00:11:49,298 --> 00:11:51,243
If anybody ever looks
sideways at you, Stewart.

149
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:53,387
No, not this trip. I do what I'm told.

150
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,332
A Marshall and me sure put
on a good act in any case.

151
00:11:58,864 --> 00:12:01,049
I'll start cheering when
you give us some results.

152
00:12:01,731 --> 00:12:03,777
In case you are wondering,
I've got another gun here.

153
00:12:03,948 --> 00:12:04,649
Loaded.

154
00:12:05,234 --> 00:12:06,935
What's the matter? Don't you trust me?

155
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,894
Calling SS 972.

156
00:12:11,454 --> 00:12:13,823
Calling SS 972. Over.

157
00:12:15,072 --> 00:12:16,271
[ Radio: ]
"<i>SS972</i>."

158
00:12:17,117 --> 00:12:17,952
"<i>Go ahead</i>."

159
00:12:18,735 --> 00:12:21,522
Agent Foreman reporting.
On Highway 40. I've got the boy.

160
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,613
"<i>Did everything go alright?</i>"
- Yeah, no trouble.

161
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:26,591
Perfect cooperation.

"<i>Good. Keep checking with us</i>."

163
00:12:29,274 --> 00:12:30,848
Right. When we get to Kansas City.

164
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:36,170
Well, how's it feel to be free?
- I'm not complaining.

165
00:12:36,599 --> 00:12:38,444
Why should you.
You're getting a square shake.

166
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:40,067
All we want are those plates.

167
00:12:40,347 --> 00:12:42,518
And your pals.
- Don't worry. I'll find them.

168
00:12:42,806 --> 00:12:44,088
Only give me a little time.

169
00:12:44,311 --> 00:12:46,757
The quicker you do it, the quicker
you'll be considered for parole.

170
00:12:46,943 --> 00:12:49,530
We'll keep our end of the bargain.
- Listen, I'm pulling my end, too.

171
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:53,102
Only keep out of my hair. I got a
lot of contacts to look up. Old leads.

172
00:12:53,461 --> 00:12:55,337
It won't help any with
you tagging along.

173
00:12:55,437 --> 00:12:56,918
Sorry, when we catch this bunch.

174
00:12:57,018 --> 00:12:58,629
We're going to be so close together.

175
00:12:58,729 --> 00:13:00,803
When you scratch your back,
you'll be scratching mine.

176
00:13:01,437 --> 00:13:02,730
Get used to it, Stewart.

177
00:13:13,412 --> 00:13:14,380
Long distance?

178
00:13:14,771 --> 00:13:17,370
That call to Chicago.
Fred Simpson. Any answer yet?

179
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:20,268
Keep checking on it.

180
00:13:22,789 --> 00:13:24,473
Bill Bryce is out. He'll call me back.

181
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:27,931
That call to Chicago
is still on ice, too.

182
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:29,895
The operator will keep checking.

183
00:13:29,995 --> 00:13:31,982
You're doing great.
- Yeah .. gum?

184
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:33,271
No thanks.

185
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:36,973
By the way, whatever happened to
your old girlfriend, Meg Dixon?

186
00:13:37,832 --> 00:13:40,119
Not a bad looking dame.
- Let me see.

187
00:13:45,526 --> 00:13:46,656
Nosy bird, aren't you?

188
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:48,465
Where is she now, Tris?

189
00:13:49,488 --> 00:13:51,991
Not in Detroit. We checked there.
- No. Not Detroit. She got married.

190
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:54,937
Last I heard she was living
up north, raising a family.

191
00:13:55,285 --> 00:13:56,666
You're lying. That's for sure.

192
00:13:57,647 --> 00:13:58,986
Okay, you tell me then.

193
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,129
"I wonder what's become of Meg."

194
00:14:01,431 --> 00:14:02,929
Sounds like the title to a song.

195
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:16,091
Ah!

196
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:19,387
Cut yourself?
- Yeah, that crummy glass.

197
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:20,920
Let's have a look.

198
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:29,445
Thank you.
- You're quite welcome.

199
00:15:47,474 --> 00:15:49,004
Hey Laurie. Some cigarettes, please.

200
00:15:51,587 --> 00:15:52,581
Laurie.

201
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:54,251
Thank you.

202
00:15:54,657 --> 00:15:56,043
I'll take the usual, Laurie.

203
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,135
How you doing?
- Not bad, Mr Hackett.

204
00:15:59,547 --> 00:16:02,592
I don't have the right change in the
tin. I'll have to give you some singles.

205
00:16:02,873 --> 00:16:05,303
Keep it. I don't like a lot of singles.

206
00:16:05,907 --> 00:16:06,694
Too bulky.

207
00:16:07,456 --> 00:16:08,500
They weigh me down.

208
00:16:08,646 --> 00:16:10,649
You travel light, don't you, Mr Hackett.

209
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:12,636
Well, I travel.

210
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:15,560
I may be moving on if you
don't show a little interest.

211
00:16:16,332 --> 00:16:18,369
Los Angeles is one
town I can do without.

212
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:20,791
Be careful. You're talking
to a native daughter.

213
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:22,386
I might report you.

214
00:16:22,804 --> 00:16:25,458
Say, when you do, tell them I don't
like their brand of hospitality.

215
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,229
A guy can die of lonesomeness here.

216
00:16:29,393 --> 00:16:30,925
Try hanging on a while, won't you?

217
00:16:31,613 --> 00:16:33,038
You might change your mind.

218
00:16:38,224 --> 00:16:39,268
That's quite a guy.

219
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:44,049
He must own a dozen oil wells, or he
thinks cigarettes are ten bucks a pack.

220
00:16:44,343 --> 00:16:46,349
If he told me he was
lonesome I'd encourage him.

221
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,234
You mean, if he were a girl?
- Sure ..

222
00:16:59,003 --> 00:16:59,727
Hello.

223
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,543
Well hello. I thought your
big night was over.

224
00:17:03,024 --> 00:17:04,184
I hope not.

225
00:17:04,837 --> 00:17:06,002
Not yet, anyway.

226
00:17:07,072 --> 00:17:09,877
I .. I thought you might
need a little protection.

227
00:17:10,177 --> 00:17:11,274
Yeah? From whom?

228
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:13,092
Oh, from lone wolves.

229
00:17:14,057 --> 00:17:15,473
Maybe a wolf pack, even.

230
00:17:15,823 --> 00:17:18,485
Oh, that's very nice of you,
but who protects me from you?

231
00:17:18,817 --> 00:17:20,884
Say .. look at me.

232
00:17:22,106 --> 00:17:25,399
Don't you see .. character
written in this face?

233
00:17:26,532 --> 00:17:28,793
Ah, you are a sort of a character.

234
00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:32,329
But I prefer to go home
alone if you don't mind.

235
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:33,975
Well.

236
00:17:34,246 --> 00:17:37,262
Shall we say goodnight or wait until?
- Until what?

237
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,553
Until a Patrol Car comes
along and I yell at them.

238
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,849
I'll go quietly.

239
00:17:43,273 --> 00:17:47,167
I don't want anything to disturb what's
going to be a delightful relationship.

240
00:17:48,102 --> 00:17:50,374
You can hope .. just like anyone else.

241
00:17:51,084 --> 00:17:52,041
I guess.

242
00:18:05,848 --> 00:18:07,976
It's me. Tris.
- Oh, honey!

243
00:18:15,592 --> 00:18:17,318
Oh I was so worried.

244
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:20,986
I read about you in the papers.
I thought they'd find you.

245
00:18:23,865 --> 00:18:25,313
Who was the creep following you?

246
00:18:25,413 --> 00:18:27,704
Nobody. Just a barnacle
who hangs around the club.

247
00:18:28,258 --> 00:18:29,159
What happened?

248
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,589
I'll tell you later. Where do you live?
- Not far.

249
00:18:34,096 --> 00:18:35,055
Come on.

250
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,154
I'm out on a prayer.

251
00:18:40,117 --> 00:18:41,705
The Feds tapped me for a stoolpigeon.

252
00:18:42,744 --> 00:18:45,690
They even sprung me, the dopes.
Then I sprung one on them.

253
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:50,495
Imagine. Tris Stewart
playing ball with the cops.

254
00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:54,741
All they got left now is some
blind-alley tips and empty bags.

255
00:18:55,545 --> 00:18:56,795
No cream, sugar.

256
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,207
What do you mean, no cream and no sugar?

257
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:01,792
Confusing, eh?

258
00:19:03,661 --> 00:19:05,338
Oh, I'm so glad you're back.

259
00:19:06,716 --> 00:19:07,511
I like it.

260
00:19:11,968 --> 00:19:13,009
I like you, too.

261
00:19:15,085 --> 00:19:15,814
Tell me.

262
00:19:16,492 --> 00:19:17,888
Anybody been prowling around?

263
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,770
Cops I mean. Asking questions?

264
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:20,987
No. Nobody.

265
00:19:21,472 --> 00:19:24,193
Not since I moved out here and changed
my name to Laurie Fredericks.

266
00:19:24,712 --> 00:19:25,643
That's good.

267
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:31,603
We'll work fast.

268
00:19:32,497 --> 00:19:34,916
We strike .. then Mexico for keeps.

269
00:19:35,817 --> 00:19:38,611
Does that sound good?
- How soon can we do it?

270
00:19:39,687 --> 00:19:42,754
First I've got to get in touch
with my ex-partner, Sam Hooker.

271
00:19:43,254 --> 00:19:46,899
That dirty rat getting rich off my
plates while I rot in the pen.

272
00:19:48,618 --> 00:19:51,031
I'll pay him a little surprise
visit tomorrow morning.

273
00:19:52,298 --> 00:19:54,131
It won't take a lot to
make a deal with him.

274
00:19:54,709 --> 00:19:58,246
And after that, baby.
It's Mexico for you and me.

275
00:20:11,815 --> 00:20:12,430
Yes?

276
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:13,904
Oh, Brown?

277
00:20:14,812 --> 00:20:15,774
Sure. Go ahead.

278
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,612
Just like that, huh?

279
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,387
Tomorrow? Good work.

280
00:20:22,898 --> 00:20:24,028
Alright. Stay with it.

281
00:20:26,816 --> 00:20:30,199
Well, if they took a census tonight we'd
have one more bad citizen in our midst.

282
00:20:30,927 --> 00:20:31,886
Let me guess.

283
00:20:32,341 --> 00:20:33,936
Would it be my ex roommate, Stewart?

284
00:20:34,461 --> 00:20:35,926
None other. Just flew in.

285
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,849
He's with the Fredericks girl right now.

286
00:20:37,949 --> 00:20:41,333
I'd like have ten minutes alone with him
after the mauling he gave me in Kansas.

287
00:20:42,029 --> 00:20:43,201
On the house, too.

288
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:46,460
As they say, orders are orders.

289
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,967
Yeah, but I'd still like ten
minutes alone with him.

290
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:50,797
The orders didn't read:
"Pull my punches".

291
00:20:51,477 --> 00:20:53,212
I could flatten him a dozen times.

292
00:20:53,848 --> 00:20:57,188
Sure you could. And you'd still be
listening to him making phone calls.

293
00:20:57,763 --> 00:20:59,698
And we'd still be
tracking down false leads.

294
00:21:00,956 --> 00:21:02,793
Except for you pride,
it's better this way.

295
00:21:07,124 --> 00:21:09,265
Is this private?
- Not at all. Nice to see you, Johnny.

296
00:21:10,387 --> 00:21:12,531
I want you to meet Fred Foreman.
This is John Downey.

297
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:13,689
Glad to know you.

298
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:16,475
You don't want to let Stewart
give you the slip in Kansas City.

299
00:21:16,807 --> 00:21:19,539
Good luck, Johnny. When you see Stewart,
give him ten bells from me will you.

300
00:21:19,639 --> 00:21:20,818
Looking forward to it.

301
00:21:20,918 --> 00:21:22,229
I've got news for you.

302
00:21:22,776 --> 00:21:23,844
Stewart is in town.

303
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:25,118
How?

304
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,588
And where is he?

305
00:21:26,844 --> 00:21:28,507
Well, at the moment he's with the girl.

306
00:21:29,401 --> 00:21:29,987
Oh.

307
00:21:30,212 --> 00:21:31,383
Don't look so unhappy.

308
00:21:31,822 --> 00:21:33,038
After all, it's his girl.

309
00:21:33,546 --> 00:21:34,905
I'm beginning to realize that.

310
00:21:35,324 --> 00:21:36,540
Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

311
00:21:36,784 --> 00:21:38,887
What's the matter? She dump you?
- Just a tip.

312
00:21:39,776 --> 00:21:42,170
You see, I'm losing my touch.
- Maybe you never had it.

313
00:21:42,697 --> 00:21:44,113
Or else she's too smart for you.

314
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,120
How about it?
- No. I don't think so.

315
00:21:46,832 --> 00:21:49,853
As far as she and everyone at the club
is concerned, I'm just Johnny Hackett.

316
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,557
A very shady character.

317
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:53,050
If they look me up.

318
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,996
I've been everything from cardsharp to a
confidence man and a record to prove it.

319
00:21:56,511 --> 00:21:57,698
I know Hackett's tricks.

320
00:21:58,075 --> 00:22:00,063
Every night he went home
and robbed his own mother.

321
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:01,718
Well, I haven't done that yet.

322
00:22:06,223 --> 00:22:07,762
Now, according to the report.

323
00:22:08,067 --> 00:22:09,626
Stewart starts moving in the morning.

324
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:11,472
He's after the plates.

325
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:14,212
Fine .. and who has the plates?

326
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:17,073
Ever hear of Sam Hooker?

327
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:18,435
Uhuh.

328
00:23:09,047 --> 00:23:10,123
[ Door knocks ]

329
00:23:20,964 --> 00:23:21,948
Who do you want?

330
00:23:22,311 --> 00:23:23,555
A better welcome, I'd say.

331
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:28,643
Do I have to blast my way
in to see my old partner?

332
00:23:29,027 --> 00:23:30,043
Well, I've been ..

333
00:23:30,233 --> 00:23:33,128
Wake up. Open your eyes.
Don't you remember me?

334
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,055
Oh I remember. It's you, Tris.

335
00:23:38,724 --> 00:23:40,516
I didn't recognize
you right off the bat.

336
00:23:40,932 --> 00:23:42,236
It's been such a long time.

337
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,015
Didn't you know I was out?

338
00:23:44,706 --> 00:23:45,307
No.

339
00:23:45,972 --> 00:23:48,702
No but .. I haven't
been feeling well, Tris.

340
00:23:49,368 --> 00:23:52,155
I don't get around much anymore.
I stay pretty close to home.

341
00:23:52,685 --> 00:23:54,446
But .. now that you're back.

342
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:56,830
What do you say you and
me have a little drink, huh?

343
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:12,357
Have a drink, Tris.

344
00:24:15,894 --> 00:24:17,978
This isn't exactly a social call.

345
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:21,247
But you are glad to see
me, aren't you, Tris?

346
00:24:21,392 --> 00:24:22,597
That all depends.

347
00:24:23,802 --> 00:24:24,531
On what?

348
00:24:25,104 --> 00:24:26,892
When I was your partner,
what you did to me.

349
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:30,084
I've been doing time for
the two of us, remember?

350
00:24:30,505 --> 00:24:34,059
I gave you a chance to draw a sweet
bank loan for us. Where's my share?

351
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,081
Lost, Tris. But I can ..

352
00:24:40,049 --> 00:24:41,250
Where's the plates?

353
00:24:42,793 --> 00:24:44,855
Have a little drink, Tris.
- Where are they?

354
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,350
I sold them.

355
00:24:48,229 --> 00:24:50,446
You thought I was as good as buried?
- No, no. Don't, Tris.

356
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:52,562
I was going to stash them away but ..

357
00:24:52,814 --> 00:24:55,374
But things got awfully tough
after they nailed you .. and ..

358
00:24:55,822 --> 00:24:58,378
The plates was hot and I got
scared and I lost my nerve and ..

359
00:24:59,006 --> 00:25:00,116
And I sold them.

360
00:25:01,585 --> 00:25:02,667
Where's my cut?

361
00:25:03,177 --> 00:25:05,175
I lost it. Just like I lost mine.

362
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,516
I lost all the dough on the
ponies, cards and dice.

363
00:25:09,027 --> 00:25:10,243
My luck's been awful bad.

364
00:25:10,445 --> 00:25:11,730
You don't know how bad.

365
00:25:11,993 --> 00:25:13,187
Who's got the plates?

366
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:15,274
I don't know.
- Try and remember!

367
00:25:17,137 --> 00:25:18,106
I don't know.

368
00:25:19,656 --> 00:25:21,225
Does his name come to you now, huh?

369
00:25:22,448 --> 00:25:23,246
Sylvester.

370
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:25,203
Jack Sylvester.

371
00:25:25,811 --> 00:25:27,725
Sylvester, huh?
- Yes ..

372
00:25:29,642 --> 00:25:31,314
He used to be one of our pals.

373
00:25:32,727 --> 00:25:34,184
Where is he now?

374
00:25:35,536 --> 00:25:36,685
I don't know.

375
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:39,717
You'd better find out.

376
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,949
He lives in Hollywood.
The Grant Building.

377
00:25:48,287 --> 00:25:49,384
Tris, don't!

378
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,561
Tris, don't ..

379
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:33,254
Looking for someone?

380
00:26:33,807 --> 00:26:35,141
Is Jack Sylvester in?

381
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:36,747
Business or personal?

382
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:38,602
A little bit of both.

383
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:40,574
Who wants to see him?

384
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,765
Just tell him it's an old friend.

385
00:26:53,843 --> 00:26:56,036
A fellow outside.
Says he's an old friend.

386
00:26:56,696 --> 00:26:57,944
What's he look like?

387
00:27:00,513 --> 00:27:01,549
Hello, Jack.

388
00:27:04,418 --> 00:27:05,376
It's okay, Mack.

389
00:27:08,103 --> 00:27:09,319
Ain't you glad to see me?

390
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:11,871
Sure. Terrific.

391
00:27:13,461 --> 00:27:15,650
You should have phoned me.
I could have met you someplace.

392
00:27:16,556 --> 00:27:17,887
I don't like you coming here.

393
00:27:32,627 --> 00:27:33,768
Relax, Sylvester.

394
00:27:35,136 --> 00:27:35,826
Gum?

395
00:27:36,504 --> 00:27:38,816
Would I bring a load of
trouble to an old friend?

396
00:27:39,847 --> 00:27:42,466
I came to L.A. because they are
looking for me in Kansas City.

397
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,312
There's two thousand miles
between me and a pinch.

398
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:49,382
You could be wrong. Of course I'm
just telling you for your own good.

399
00:27:51,876 --> 00:27:52,641
Well.

400
00:27:53,921 --> 00:27:55,165
What's on your mind, Tris?

401
00:27:59,865 --> 00:28:01,281
I'd like to get in action again.

402
00:28:01,935 --> 00:28:03,237
I figured you could help me.

403
00:28:03,507 --> 00:28:04,198
Maybe.

404
00:28:05,955 --> 00:28:08,802
I suppose you know that Sam
clipped me for those plates.

405
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:11,013
That's too bad.
- Yeah, isn't it.

406
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,999
But you got the plates.

407
00:28:15,639 --> 00:28:16,469
So what?

408
00:28:18,146 --> 00:28:20,002
So I'd like to buy a little merchandise.

409
00:28:23,603 --> 00:28:24,475
Listen, Tris.

410
00:28:25,383 --> 00:28:28,162
You're on your uppers and what you're
talking about takes real dough to plan.

411
00:28:28,262 --> 00:28:29,105
I know that.

412
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:31,056
I can raise it.

413
00:28:31,469 --> 00:28:34,141
Got to be strictly cash and carry
and nothing less than 25 G's ..

414
00:28:34,241 --> 00:28:35,856
I'll tell you something.
Nothing less.

415
00:28:35,956 --> 00:28:37,725
Okay. I'll raise the 25 G's.

416
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:40,915
Though I'll need a little eating money.

417
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:48,694
There's a pair.

418
00:28:51,016 --> 00:28:53,602
Okay .. I'll be back with the 25 G's.

419
00:28:53,849 --> 00:28:54,905
Cash on the line.

420
00:29:02,852 --> 00:29:05,109
That dame must eat, sleep
and wash to Rumba music.

421
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:08,098
She sure loves her South American way.

422
00:29:08,565 --> 00:29:10,561
You'd think the record
would break or wear out.

423
00:29:11,077 --> 00:29:12,889
"<i>What happened? Did you see Hooker?</i>"

424
00:29:13,075 --> 00:29:14,577
"<i>Yeah, I saw him. He threw me out</i>."

425
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:15,883
Then Jack Sylvester.

426
00:29:17,209 --> 00:29:19,762
So, I had a little talk with Sylvester.
I think we got a deal cooking.

427
00:29:20,103 --> 00:29:21,757
Honey, please don't take any chances.

428
00:29:22,215 --> 00:29:24,897
I've been worried all afternoon.
- Stop worrying. I know what I'm doing.

429
00:29:25,172 --> 00:29:27,427
Are you sure you weren't followed?
- You can never be sure.

430
00:29:27,527 --> 00:29:29,296
Anyway, I'm taking precautions.

431
00:29:29,947 --> 00:29:33,599
I've been changing from street cars to
cabs to buses all in about five miles.

432
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:36,186
You got a cold beer in the house?

433
00:29:36,288 --> 00:29:37,854
Yeah, there's some in the icebox.

434
00:29:41,775 --> 00:29:42,488
Relax.

435
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,486
Now.

436
00:29:55,844 --> 00:29:58,771
You know, they say Mexico
is a wonderful place to relax.

437
00:30:00,185 --> 00:30:01,154
I read about it.

438
00:30:01,507 --> 00:30:02,438
Yeah.

439
00:30:02,782 --> 00:30:04,885
And I'll tell you what else
it's a wonderful place for.

440
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:06,071
American money.

441
00:30:06,366 --> 00:30:08,414
Good old dollars. Down there
they're starving for it.

442
00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:13,601
I can push a quarter million with
the phony money just like that.

443
00:30:14,701 --> 00:30:18,595
I'd settle for half of that.
- Half? All of it, baby.

444
00:30:20,007 --> 00:30:22,518
Only trouble is, I've got to
have real dough to swing it.

445
00:30:23,209 --> 00:30:24,793
Everybody has that trouble, honey.

446
00:30:25,312 --> 00:30:27,519
It's the one thing in the world
there is never enough of.

447
00:30:28,478 --> 00:30:29,579
You know what I need?

448
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,999
I need a nice friendly safe.

449
00:30:35,027 --> 00:30:37,926
Forget it. I don't think we
could risk anything like that.

450
00:30:38,373 --> 00:30:40,869
Safes can be real trouble.
- Not if you know how to open them.

451
00:30:42,921 --> 00:30:44,091
Tell me, baby.

452
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:47,543
What's the weekend take
of that club of yours, huh?

453
00:30:48,577 --> 00:30:50,422
I don't know.
- Yes, you do. Come on, tell me.

454
00:30:50,522 --> 00:30:51,848
I don't know.
- Tell me!

455
00:30:52,147 --> 00:30:55,017
Sometimes 17 to 18 thousand
but honey I'm afraid.

456
00:30:55,175 --> 00:30:57,109
"<i>You'll help? You love me, don't you?</i>"

457
00:30:57,663 --> 00:30:59,663
"<i>You know I do. But can
you get away with me?</i>"

458
00:30:59,968 --> 00:31:01,149
"<i>Maybe with your help</i>."

459
00:31:05,435 --> 00:31:07,992
If Stewart tries to pull off this
job, he'll get killed, or jail.

460
00:31:08,374 --> 00:31:09,391
Not good.

461
00:31:10,907 --> 00:31:14,659
We'll just have to stop him or write
off everything we've done so far.

462
00:31:15,585 --> 00:31:17,932
We just can't afford to let
this man jam himself up.

463
00:31:18,803 --> 00:31:21,383
He won't if we work fast.
It may be just what we need.

464
00:31:23,253 --> 00:31:25,233
Get me the Hollywood Police station.
- "<i>Yes, sir</i>."

465
00:31:36,139 --> 00:31:36,954
Am I tired.

466
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,586
You sure enjoyed it tonight, Sam.
- You can say that again.

467
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:42,664
Goodnight, Laurie. See you tomorrow.
- Goodnight Mr Baker.

468
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:44,714
Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Sam.

469
00:32:11,376 --> 00:32:12,700
You know what to, don't you?

470
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,876
When you come out of the parking lot to
the club, I start driving towards you.

471
00:32:16,094 --> 00:32:17,250
Right. No slip up.

472
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:20,385
Tris, I'm terribly frightened.
- Stop it. It's no time for the jitters.

473
00:32:20,797 --> 00:32:23,043
All you have to do is start this
car when you see me coming.

474
00:32:38,379 --> 00:32:39,734
Maybe we'd better forget it.

475
00:32:40,363 --> 00:32:42,839
There's too many cops crawling around.
Suppose something happened?

476
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:44,559
Suppose you get hurt?

477
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:47,131
If anybody gets hurt, it won't be me.
Not as long as I've got a gun.

478
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:49,554
Just remember to start the engine
when you see me coming.

479
00:33:05,311 --> 00:33:06,438
Having trouble, lady?

480
00:33:06,978 --> 00:33:10,463
No. I just can't start my car.
I guess the engine's at fault.

481
00:33:13,954 --> 00:33:16,085
The first lesson in driving is
to turn on your ignition.

482
00:33:16,863 --> 00:33:17,769
Oh, yes.

483
00:33:18,002 --> 00:33:20,047
What are you doing here
at this time of the morning?

484
00:33:20,147 --> 00:33:22,590
Nothing. I just work over at the
club and I'm on my way home.

485
00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:24,010
Who's your boyfriend?

486
00:33:24,527 --> 00:33:27,021
What boyfriend?
- The man that just got out of your car.

487
00:33:30,122 --> 00:33:32,555
Why, he didn't get out of my car.
- Pick him up.

488
00:33:36,185 --> 00:33:37,153
Stop!

489
00:33:49,957 --> 00:33:52,134
Well Laurie, everything squared away?

490
00:33:52,292 --> 00:33:54,628
Yeah Johnny, thanks to you.
- Ah, forget it.

491
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:57,028
I waited a long time for a date.

492
00:33:57,537 --> 00:33:59,497
But I didn't think I'd need
an arrest to swing it.

493
00:33:59,834 --> 00:34:02,352
How much do I owe you?
- 300 will take care of my end.

494
00:34:03,023 --> 00:34:03,973
Fair enough.

495
00:34:06,028 --> 00:34:08,870
Thanks. If there is any more
trouble, I give 24 hour service.

496
00:34:09,174 --> 00:34:10,406
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

497
00:34:25,844 --> 00:34:28,392
Well, Laurie.
That is that, to coin a phrase.

498
00:34:28,674 --> 00:34:30,457
You really came through for me, Johnny.

499
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:33,076
Why not? I've been
in these spots myself.

500
00:34:33,956 --> 00:34:37,283
I don't want to kid you, Johnny.
Someone depends an awful lot on me.

501
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,790
Yeah? Well, he hasn't
been much help to you.

502
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:41,849
Why don't you ditch the guy?

503
00:34:42,272 --> 00:34:44,903
Because he needs me.
And he needs a break.

504
00:34:45,395 --> 00:34:47,795
He's got you .. puts him one up on me.

505
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:51,134
I'd go all out, Laurie.

506
00:34:51,706 --> 00:34:53,903
If it would help you.
- That's swell of you.

507
00:34:54,213 --> 00:34:55,194
But only you.

508
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,755
I'm selfish about everything but money.

509
00:34:58,775 --> 00:35:01,875
I just happen to have a little loose
change burning a hole in my pocket.

510
00:35:02,386 --> 00:35:04,003
That puts you in a class by yourself.

511
00:35:04,392 --> 00:35:06,751
Yeah .. but I'd rather not be by myself.

512
00:35:07,729 --> 00:35:09,746
It's more fun spending it
when you've got some help.

513
00:35:11,573 --> 00:35:12,445
How about it?

514
00:35:12,672 --> 00:35:14,372
Well, it's an interesting idea.

515
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:16,454
Think it over.

516
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,458
You can always meet me
at the Hotel Marguerite.

517
00:35:26,304 --> 00:35:27,385
[ Door knocks ]

518
00:35:35,989 --> 00:35:37,062
Okay. It's me, Tris.

519
00:35:37,942 --> 00:35:39,369
Are you alright?
- Yeah.

520
00:35:42,499 --> 00:35:43,995
What happened? I was worried.

521
00:35:44,259 --> 00:35:47,053
Nothing. Sorry I had to run out on
you that way. But what could I do?

522
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,475
Worked out fine. And you're out, too.
- Sure, it was just like that.

523
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:53,518
All it took was 300 bucks,
a lawyer and a good friend.

524
00:35:54,549 --> 00:35:57,154
Yeah? Who's the good friend?
- Johnny Hackett, the guy at the club.

525
00:35:57,349 --> 00:35:59,173
And you said he didn't
mean anything to you?

526
00:35:59,273 --> 00:36:01,120
He doesn't, I say.
- Well, what's he after?

527
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,960
Nothing, he's not after anything.

528
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,171
What's the matter? You ought
to be glad I got a friend.

529
00:36:05,271 --> 00:36:07,620
Well, I'm not, see. I don't like
the way this guy is moving in.

530
00:36:07,897 --> 00:36:11,276
You're crazy. Just because a guy happens
to like me you start getting ideas.

531
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:13,746
I'd have been in a swell spot
if he hadn't come through.

532
00:36:15,247 --> 00:36:15,976
Alright.

533
00:36:18,062 --> 00:36:19,221
What's his pitch, then?

534
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:22,101
I think he's lying low.
I know for sure he's loaded.

535
00:36:22,372 --> 00:36:25,100
He spends big, tips big ..
- And he talks big. Don't they all?

536
00:36:28,073 --> 00:36:29,375
You think he's a racket guy?

537
00:36:29,516 --> 00:36:31,652
You don't make that kind
of dough selling bibles.

538
00:36:32,516 --> 00:36:35,061
You might be right.
- It's what I've tried to tell you.

539
00:36:36,116 --> 00:36:37,332
What are you going to do?

540
00:36:37,432 --> 00:36:39,634
Look this guy up. He might be
interested in a proposition.

541
00:36:39,876 --> 00:36:41,172
From me this time.

542
00:36:41,662 --> 00:36:44,204
Tris honey, please let me
handle it. You don't know him.

543
00:36:45,301 --> 00:36:46,288
It's time we met.

544
00:36:46,744 --> 00:36:48,618
Where does this guy hang out?
Besides the club?

545
00:36:49,815 --> 00:36:52,877
It's the Marguerite hotel,
but please honey, be careful.

546
00:36:53,523 --> 00:36:54,641
I'll see you later.

547
00:38:21,501 --> 00:38:22,373
What is this?

548
00:38:22,556 --> 00:38:24,512
What's the idea of
making a play for my girl?

549
00:38:25,072 --> 00:38:26,268
What you talking about?

550
00:38:26,368 --> 00:38:28,066
Laurie Fredericks. The girl at the club.

551
00:38:28,583 --> 00:38:29,357
Get up.

552
00:38:32,715 --> 00:38:35,440
Next time you even take a look
at her, I'll cool you for keeps.

553
00:38:35,864 --> 00:38:38,759
If you didn't have a gun on me,
I'd beat your brains out.

554
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:40,999
Cheap penny-alley grifter.

555
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,131
Oh, I see.

556
00:38:43,598 --> 00:38:44,904
So you're big-time, huh?

557
00:38:47,674 --> 00:38:49,262
I've been rummaging through your gear.

558
00:38:49,947 --> 00:38:51,744
By the looks of things,
you're not too big.

559
00:38:52,191 --> 00:38:55,708
Cold cards. Cold dice. I'd say there was
quite a bit of room for improvement.

560
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,082
I'm doing alright.
- Yeah?

561
00:38:58,615 --> 00:39:00,317
How would you like
to do a little better?

562
00:39:02,268 --> 00:39:03,567
I don't like guns.

563
00:39:04,688 --> 00:39:07,164
I had something else in mind.
- Well, keep it there.

564
00:39:07,516 --> 00:39:08,484
You'll get it.

565
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,587
How would you like to fit
yourself into a good deal?

566
00:39:14,744 --> 00:39:17,455
Sorry .. I don't make
deals with strangers.

567
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,933
Especially when their
name is Tris Stewart.

568
00:39:20,263 --> 00:39:21,650
What difference does that make?

569
00:39:22,397 --> 00:39:23,626
I read about that break.

570
00:39:24,224 --> 00:39:26,069
You're pretty hot.
You ought to be hiding out.

571
00:39:26,212 --> 00:39:26,879
Nah.

572
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:29,561
Not when there is a big
jackpot ripe to be taken.

573
00:39:30,605 --> 00:39:32,249
All I need is the right combination.

574
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:33,584
You might be it.

575
00:39:33,885 --> 00:39:36,417
Listen, if you thought that, why did
you open with a punch on my nose?

576
00:39:36,588 --> 00:39:37,736
I was griping at you.

577
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:41,221
I bet you I can make you forget
that when you hear my offer.

578
00:39:41,454 --> 00:39:42,784
Okay, make it. I'm listening.

579
00:39:44,201 --> 00:39:44,845
Okay.

580
00:39:45,386 --> 00:39:48,107
If I had 25 G's I could stretch
it to a quarter of a million.

581
00:39:48,654 --> 00:39:50,528
Don't interrupt.
That quarter million is phony.

582
00:39:51,187 --> 00:39:53,018
But it's so good it
would pass in a bank.

583
00:39:54,143 --> 00:39:56,286
And I already got the
territory to operate.

584
00:39:57,293 --> 00:40:00,298
That's one racket I know, brother.
- Ha. So does the government.

585
00:40:00,818 --> 00:40:01,886
Look who's talking.

586
00:40:02,448 --> 00:40:04,465
I suppose they don't know
about you and your racket?

587
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:07,291
This way you'd at least make a strike.

588
00:40:08,048 --> 00:40:09,379
Besides, I take all the risk.

589
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:12,285
Even so, I don't like tangling
with counterfeit dough.

590
00:40:12,737 --> 00:40:15,446
Once you burn your fingers on that,
it takes a long time to heal.

591
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:17,317
Didn't I just say <i>I </i>do all the work?

592
00:40:17,534 --> 00:40:20,095
All you have to do is rustle
up the 25 G's. Can you?

593
00:40:21,538 --> 00:40:23,234
Well, the amount doesn't worry me.

594
00:40:23,999 --> 00:40:25,501
It's just that it's out of my line.

595
00:40:26,262 --> 00:40:27,462
Let me think it over.

596
00:40:27,887 --> 00:40:29,641
Think hard. I'll know where to find you.

597
00:40:30,114 --> 00:40:31,098
Drop in, later.

598
00:40:31,537 --> 00:40:34,718
If you want to punch a thing, punch the
door first. I'll wake up just as quick.

599
00:40:36,205 --> 00:40:37,192
No hard feelings.

600
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:47,901
I've never heard of
this guy Johnny Hackett.

601
00:40:48,506 --> 00:40:50,294
Maybe you don't get
around like you used to.

602
00:40:50,607 --> 00:40:52,323
His front business is cardsharp.

603
00:40:52,423 --> 00:40:53,726
Get some more dope on him.

604
00:40:54,181 --> 00:40:56,198
He and Bugsy McGill used
to work smuggling together.

605
00:40:56,748 --> 00:40:57,706
A pleasure boat.

606
00:40:58,185 --> 00:40:59,630
They made three successful trips.

607
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:02,935
Before the captains got wise to them
and invited them to travel by rowboat.

608
00:41:03,641 --> 00:41:04,566
Bring him in.

609
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:13,583
Hackett, this is Sylvester. Say
hello boys. Let's get down to cases.

610
00:41:13,809 --> 00:41:14,986
How are you?
- Hello.

611
00:41:15,496 --> 00:41:17,187
By "cases" he means "money", Hackett.

612
00:41:17,993 --> 00:41:19,237
I understand you're ready.

613
00:41:19,367 --> 00:41:22,334
That depends .. mind
if I see the attraction?

614
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:35,919
Try that for size.

615
00:41:46,858 --> 00:41:48,131
The skin you love to touch.

616
00:41:48,555 --> 00:41:50,492
I have never yet seen
its equal, Hackett.

617
00:41:51,994 --> 00:41:52,783
I have.

618
00:41:53,226 --> 00:41:56,515
In any cash drawer. This is genuine.
What are you trying to pull on me?

619
00:41:57,588 --> 00:42:00,217
Ha-ha .. he thinks it's the McCoy.

620
00:42:00,756 --> 00:42:01,870
How do you like that?

621
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:04,342
And you said you knew what
a queer looks like. Are you kidding?

622
00:42:04,558 --> 00:42:06,768
No. It looks real. Let me see it again.

623
00:42:09,258 --> 00:42:11,189
Hackett. You're looking
at the cream of the crop.

624
00:42:12,725 --> 00:42:14,825
It's a plenty fine job, and
Uncle Sam didn't make it.

625
00:42:16,837 --> 00:42:19,248
Look at the border .. those sharp lines.

626
00:42:20,669 --> 00:42:21,980
This one is on the level.

627
00:42:22,438 --> 00:42:23,414
Compare them.

628
00:42:24,641 --> 00:42:25,714
See the difference?

629
00:42:26,808 --> 00:42:28,138
I guess I owe you an apology.

630
00:42:29,166 --> 00:42:31,622
Yes. It's queer alright.
But you have to look awful close.

631
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:34,532
Sorry I didn't stumble
it the first time.

632
00:42:34,869 --> 00:42:36,964
But I had to be sure.
- Oh, think nothing of it.

633
00:42:37,365 --> 00:42:39,179
I'd have done the same
thing in your place.

634
00:42:39,551 --> 00:42:41,493
Well I .. gather you're sold?

635
00:42:42,469 --> 00:42:43,684
Next problem is delivery.

636
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:45,297
Any ideas, Tris?

637
00:42:45,893 --> 00:42:47,595
Hackett is going to
draw the dough first.

638
00:42:47,977 --> 00:42:49,110
That will be tomorrow.

639
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,215
How about us meeting
at a place in town, huh?

640
00:42:51,315 --> 00:42:53,196
Sure. Any time after the banks open.

641
00:42:53,451 --> 00:42:55,475
Around noon?
- Noon is fine.

642
00:42:56,146 --> 00:42:59,374
Suppose we contact in Hollywood?
Some place along Fountain Avenue?

643
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:02,690
Alright. How about between Crescent
Heights and Hayworth? On the north side.

644
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:03,482
Fine.

645
00:43:03,582 --> 00:43:05,462
Alright with you, Hackett?
- Whatever you say.

646
00:43:05,562 --> 00:43:07,015
It's a deal, then. Noon tomorrow.

647
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:46,713
"<i>Go ahead, John</i>."
- The deal is on.

648
00:43:47,177 --> 00:43:49,432
Delivery will be made
at 12 noon tomorrow.

649
00:43:50,168 --> 00:43:52,225
Stewart and I will park
on Fountain Avenue.

650
00:43:52,392 --> 00:43:55,497
Between Crescent Heights and Hayworth.
North side of the street.

651
00:43:56,085 --> 00:43:57,415
It looks like the real thing.

652
00:43:57,582 --> 00:44:00,136
"<i>We'll have the place staked out.
Every man will be covering you</i>."

653
00:44:00,324 --> 00:44:04,323
Don't close in until you actually see
my money pass into the receiver's hands.

654
00:44:04,926 --> 00:44:06,685
That will be the signal.
- "<i>Right, Johnny</i>."

655
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:09,533
When I see you hand over the
money, that will be my cue.

656
00:44:10,383 --> 00:44:11,942
My boys won't move until I tell them.

657
00:44:12,508 --> 00:44:13,312
Good luck.

658
00:44:30,426 --> 00:44:31,871
Now, you all have your positions.

659
00:44:33,125 --> 00:44:34,713
I'll be in front of the grocery store.

660
00:44:36,415 --> 00:44:38,150
When I see our agent
hand over the money.

661
00:44:39,258 --> 00:44:42,424
I'll take a beer case off the
stack and set it on the sidewalk.

662
00:44:43,989 --> 00:44:45,882
That will be your signal to close in.

663
00:44:48,202 --> 00:44:51,123
When it touches the
sidewalk. Not before.

664
00:44:52,302 --> 00:44:55,501
Now I want it understood, that nobody
makes a move until you get the signal.

665
00:44:56,533 --> 00:44:58,963
If you jump the gun .. you
can blow this whole case.

666
00:44:59,293 --> 00:45:00,510
And maybe lose a man.

667
00:45:01,062 --> 00:45:03,649
So keep your eyes on me. Is that clear?

668
00:45:06,934 --> 00:45:07,663
Alright.

669
00:45:08,097 --> 00:45:09,542
And have your standby cars ready.

670
00:45:09,728 --> 00:45:11,127
They may try a getaway.

671
00:45:11,859 --> 00:45:12,989
That's all, gentlemen.

672
00:46:40,606 --> 00:46:41,564
Cagey, isn't he?

673
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,295
He thinks it might be a trap.

674
00:46:43,443 --> 00:46:45,011
I like guys that are careful.

675
00:46:45,696 --> 00:46:47,169
It means less chance of a slip-up.

676
00:46:47,423 --> 00:46:49,411
Yeah, but I want to get
it over with and get going.

677
00:47:17,272 --> 00:47:18,093
Hiya, Tris.

678
00:47:18,885 --> 00:47:20,351
Hello, Hackett.
- Hello.

679
00:47:21,064 --> 00:47:22,972
You got your money?
- Right here.

680
00:47:23,745 --> 00:47:24,789
So, let's see one.

681
00:47:26,614 --> 00:47:27,358
Wait ..

682
00:47:28,086 --> 00:47:29,333
Just a minute.

683
00:47:36,813 --> 00:47:37,457
Good.

684
00:47:39,682 --> 00:47:40,433
Okay.

685
00:48:04,253 --> 00:48:05,412
Let's have the package.

686
00:48:06,672 --> 00:48:07,746
How about my payoff?

687
00:48:12,919 --> 00:48:14,020
Hey, what's the idea?

688
00:48:14,181 --> 00:48:16,255
What do you mean, Tris?
- Package is just scrap paper.

689
00:48:22,992 --> 00:48:24,208
Because I had to be sure.

690
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:26,659
It might be a trap.
You I know, Hackett, I don't.

691
00:48:27,172 --> 00:48:29,621
You knucklehead.
Pulling a test-run on me.

692
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:36,351
Now cool off.

693
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:38,650
There's nothing new about a test run.

694
00:48:39,634 --> 00:48:40,685
Just playing safe.

695
00:48:41,034 --> 00:48:43,251
Yeah, well let's stop playing.
Hackett is on the up and up.

696
00:48:43,351 --> 00:48:45,320
And I'm running out of patience.
When do we deal?

697
00:48:45,738 --> 00:48:46,811
You'll hear from me.

698
00:48:47,243 --> 00:48:48,688
You're okay in my books, Hackett.

699
00:49:04,258 --> 00:49:05,572
How careful can you get?

700
00:49:05,992 --> 00:49:08,009
I'll explain it to you later.
Let's get out of here.

701
00:49:23,746 --> 00:49:25,034
I can sure use this.

702
00:49:25,417 --> 00:49:27,377
What a day.
- Yeah.

703
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:31,199
Here is to money and
the time to spend it.

704
00:49:31,778 --> 00:49:33,828
I'll drink to that. Real money.

705
00:49:34,725 --> 00:49:35,988
And no more test-runs.

706
00:49:37,004 --> 00:49:38,195
You can say that again.

707
00:49:39,212 --> 00:49:42,581
I'm a little mixed up .. I thought you
guys were in a hurry to make a deal.

708
00:49:43,015 --> 00:49:44,517
Do you always waste time like this?

709
00:49:45,379 --> 00:49:47,380
Let's face it. Sylvester wasn't sure.

710
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:48,950
Why?

711
00:49:49,742 --> 00:49:51,473
You might have been
working with the cops.

712
00:49:52,156 --> 00:49:54,082
Okay, suppose you were
they you made a pinch.

713
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,937
All they'd have got would have been
a bundle of paper. Plain paper.

714
00:49:57,755 --> 00:49:59,257
You can't get a conviction on that.

715
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:00,851
Try it sometime.

716
00:50:01,474 --> 00:50:03,808
I'm not in that business,
thanks. I play for keeps.

717
00:50:04,081 --> 00:50:05,432
Well so do we, Johnny.

718
00:50:05,761 --> 00:50:07,955
He just didn't want to take
any chances, that's all.

719
00:50:08,576 --> 00:50:09,772
You're in now, Hackett.

720
00:50:10,917 --> 00:50:13,368
Next trip, it will be the
real thing. No more paper.

721
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,680
Okay, I'm ready when they are,
but the sooner the better.

722
00:50:17,053 --> 00:50:19,653
When do you deal, Tris?
- As soon as I hear from Sylvester.

723
00:50:20,545 --> 00:50:22,610
I'll get a hold of you, don't worry.

724
00:50:23,383 --> 00:50:24,484
Thanks for the drink.

725
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,136
I'll see you at the club.

726
00:50:27,919 --> 00:50:30,179
I'll be at the bar, spending <i>real </i>money.

727
00:50:30,523 --> 00:50:32,222
And for that, you get <i>real </i>service.

728
00:50:32,775 --> 00:50:35,168
And Hackett, you can forget
about those ten-buck tips.

729
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,937
You're a member of the family now.
Kind of a brother.

730
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:39,844
Thanks. That makes it easier.

731
00:50:40,433 --> 00:50:42,742
And don't forget, that
makes Laurie your sister.

732
00:50:43,189 --> 00:50:44,233
Treat her that way.

733
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:46,199
That's not too easy.

734
00:50:54,992 --> 00:50:57,425
Good evening, Mr Hackett.
- Good evening, Laurie.

735
00:50:59,715 --> 00:51:01,102
This way, please.
- Thank you.

736
00:51:09,373 --> 00:51:11,183
Johnny. Johnny Downey.

737
00:51:11,919 --> 00:51:14,293
How you been, Johnny?
- Afraid you got the wrong party, pal.

738
00:51:14,451 --> 00:51:17,391
Oh, not a chance.
Oh, Betty. Betty, come here.

739
00:51:18,235 --> 00:51:19,365
It's been a long time.

740
00:51:19,855 --> 00:51:21,859
I want you to meet the wife. Betty ..

741
00:51:22,335 --> 00:51:24,720
This is Johnny Downey.
- You're making a mistake.

742
00:51:25,035 --> 00:51:26,169
My name is Hackett.

743
00:51:26,882 --> 00:51:29,646
Hackett? OH, don't give me that.
You're Johnny Downey.

744
00:51:30,062 --> 00:51:31,163
The guy is plastered.

745
00:51:31,385 --> 00:51:33,198
Leave him alone, Bill.
- I'd appreciate it.

746
00:51:33,461 --> 00:51:35,233
Look, I'm expecting somebody.

747
00:51:35,608 --> 00:51:37,553
Oh .. oh, I get it.

748
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:40,521
Come on Betty. The man
is right. He's not Downey.

749
00:51:42,106 --> 00:51:43,522
Sorry, pal. I should have known.

750
00:51:50,887 --> 00:51:53,720
What was that all about?
- I'll tell you when we get seated.

751
00:51:55,922 --> 00:51:57,066
Thank you.

752
00:52:00,382 --> 00:52:02,310
He's a government agent.
- A government agent?

753
00:52:02,826 --> 00:52:05,096
Probably undercover.
I hope I didn't tip his hand.

754
00:52:05,435 --> 00:52:06,917
You and your mysterious friends.

755
00:52:07,089 --> 00:52:09,406
I tell you Betty, I knew him
when he was in the army.

756
00:52:09,737 --> 00:52:10,884
Military Intelligence.

757
00:52:11,096 --> 00:52:12,798
Before that he was
in the Secret Service.

758
00:52:12,898 --> 00:52:15,459
What a dope I am.
- Why don't you admit you got the brush?

759
00:52:16,118 --> 00:52:18,274
Waiter, two Scotch and sodas, please.

760
00:52:18,537 --> 00:52:19,664
Yes, madam.

761
00:52:20,323 --> 00:52:21,977
Secret Service? Huh!

762
00:52:36,429 --> 00:52:37,588
Say, you're home early.

763
00:52:37,688 --> 00:52:39,618
Those records I rented
gave me the creeps.

764
00:52:40,225 --> 00:52:43,014
Tris, I left some packages out in the
hall. Will you help me with them?

765
00:52:49,452 --> 00:52:50,911
I think there is a talking risk.

766
00:52:51,011 --> 00:52:54,042
Tris, Hackett is a cop. His real
name is Downey. Secret Service.

767
00:52:54,452 --> 00:52:55,873
Who told you that?
- Customers.

768
00:52:55,973 --> 00:52:58,447
They were talking and they said he
was an agent with the government.

769
00:52:58,655 --> 00:53:01,634
I thought the room might be wired, so ..
- Alright, let's find out.

770
00:53:02,796 --> 00:53:03,859
You be quiet.

771
00:54:04,782 --> 00:54:07,423
It's all over.
He knows about everything.

772
00:54:07,667 --> 00:54:09,860
Yeah, he knows too much.
- What are we going to do?

773
00:54:10,118 --> 00:54:13,072
We'll play along. I've still
got to get my 25 G's.

774
00:54:13,382 --> 00:54:15,642
No, I'm frightened.
Let's get out while we can.

775
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,612
We'll get out alright, don't worry. But
Hackett is going to pay our expenses.

776
00:54:19,645 --> 00:54:21,759
Now this is what you do.
You stay here tonight.

777
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:25,067
And first thing tomorrow morning
buy us two tickets to Mexico City.

778
00:54:25,216 --> 00:54:27,105
The evening plane.
Use the name "Rodney".

779
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:28,443
Where are you going?

780
00:54:28,593 --> 00:54:31,354
I've got other business to attend to.
I'll meet you at the airport restaurant.

781
00:54:31,973 --> 00:54:33,814
Got the name straight?
- "Rodney", yeah.

782
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:36,638
That's right. Now, when
you leave use the back door.

783
00:54:37,014 --> 00:54:38,723
Make sure that you are not tailed.

784
00:54:47,294 --> 00:54:48,833
[ Door knocks ]

785
00:54:54,744 --> 00:54:56,477
Ah hello, Stewart.
- What's up?

786
00:54:57,565 --> 00:54:58,815
Just heard from Sylvester.

787
00:54:59,985 --> 00:55:01,687
He says to meet him
at one o'clock sharp.

788
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:03,262
Where?

789
00:55:04,089 --> 00:55:05,266
In front of the hotel.

790
00:55:06,507 --> 00:55:09,045
Then he'll take us to the spot.
- Well, that figures.

791
00:55:10,092 --> 00:55:11,433
Want some coffee?
- Nope.

792
00:55:13,021 --> 00:55:15,383
You .. got the dough?

793
00:55:15,955 --> 00:55:16,799
Not on me.

794
00:55:17,151 --> 00:55:20,090
I don't make a practice of lining
my pockets with 25 G's in cash.

795
00:55:20,618 --> 00:55:23,390
After the last .. rehearsal,
I put it back in the vault.

796
00:55:24,508 --> 00:55:27,170
Well, you'd better get dressed.
Then we'll go down and take it out.

797
00:56:00,715 --> 00:56:02,157
Get the money?
- Uhuh.

798
00:56:03,209 --> 00:56:05,340
We'd better go back to the
hotel and wait for Sylvester.

799
00:56:05,848 --> 00:56:08,100
No, let's just keep moving.
Might be wiser.

800
00:56:09,226 --> 00:56:10,699
What's the matter? Anything wrong?

801
00:56:11,548 --> 00:56:13,123
Could be. Never can tell.

802
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:16,541
You think we'd better call off the deal?

803
00:56:17,403 --> 00:56:18,779
I already called it off.

804
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:21,473
You're kidding?

805
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:23,526
No, Hackett. You remind me of somebody.

806
00:56:24,216 --> 00:56:26,421
Like who?
- Like a Secret Service agent.

807
00:56:26,881 --> 00:56:28,189
Now keep driving.

808
00:56:29,138 --> 00:56:30,354
Don't be a fool, Stewart.

809
00:56:30,661 --> 00:56:33,606
What you want to muff a good chance for?
- A chance for what? To play stoolie?

810
00:56:33,706 --> 00:56:35,661
That's the deal, Stewart.
That's why you're out.

811
00:56:35,761 --> 00:56:37,871
And that's why I'm staying out.
On my own terms, too.

812
00:56:39,053 --> 00:56:40,793
You had yourself quite
a time, didn't you.

813
00:56:41,383 --> 00:56:44,977
Playing a hotshot gambler, tipping heavy
for smokes. Making a play for my girl.

814
00:56:45,077 --> 00:56:47,156
Why not think of your girl,
Stewart? Give her a break.

815
00:56:47,256 --> 00:56:48,436
Why don't you shut up.

816
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:52,552
Pretty lucky for me,
I found you out when I did.

817
00:56:53,142 --> 00:56:55,918
You know, you're the only link
between me and your Federal buddies.

818
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:58,610
That's a link I'm going to have to cut.

819
00:56:59,814 --> 00:57:01,030
Just keep driving.

820
00:57:01,661 --> 00:57:03,387
I want to show you a beautiful view.

821
00:57:40,181 --> 00:57:41,394
Take the money out.

822
00:57:43,673 --> 00:57:44,917
Throw it on the back seat.

823
00:57:47,456 --> 00:57:48,357
Follow me out.

824
00:57:51,295 --> 00:57:52,142
Come on.

825
00:58:40,472 --> 00:58:44,094
Book him. Assault with intent
to kill. I'll sign the complaint.

826
00:58:44,817 --> 00:58:46,433
Put him where he can't talk to anybody.

827
00:58:46,618 --> 00:58:48,950
Don't worry, if he wants to talk
he'll have to talk to himself.

828
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:54,818
Oh .. book him under another name.

829
00:58:56,965 --> 00:59:00,520
Just tell the newspaper boys he's
a hitchhiker who tried a stick-up.

830
00:59:03,142 --> 00:59:04,843
We don't want any publicity on this.

831
00:59:05,435 --> 00:59:07,802
How does the name of "Blake" sound?
- Good as any.

832
00:59:08,317 --> 00:59:09,676
Agent-in-charge Gunby, please.

833
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:11,433
It's my mother-in-law's name.

834
00:59:11,685 --> 00:59:14,795
I just liked to see how it would
look on a Police blotter.

835
00:59:16,387 --> 00:59:17,145
Mr Gunby?

836
00:59:17,742 --> 00:59:18,886
This is Downey.

837
00:59:19,299 --> 00:59:20,566
Stewart was tipped off.

838
00:59:21,076 --> 00:59:24,143
I'll explain later how it happened. I'll
book Stewart in at the Police station.

839
00:59:25,017 --> 00:59:26,345
Well, there goes the case.

840
00:59:26,944 --> 00:59:28,730
Wait a minute. It's not dead yet.

841
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:30,853
Why can't I go ahead without Stewart?

842
00:59:31,093 --> 00:59:32,166
That's pretty risky.

843
00:59:32,266 --> 00:59:34,113
Without him along,
they'll be too suspicious.

844
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,382
That's the chance I'll take.

845
00:59:36,609 --> 00:59:37,882
Stewart can't tip them now.

846
00:59:38,244 --> 00:59:39,775
My big worry is Laurie Fredericks.

847
00:59:40,169 --> 00:59:41,299
She could fix me good.

848
00:59:42,026 --> 00:59:44,724
Unless you pick her up
before I contact Sylvester.

849
00:59:47,082 --> 00:59:48,469
Alright. We'll do that for you.

850
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:49,695
But it's your idea.

851
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:52,472
Where do you meet Sylvester?
- "<i>At his office</i>."

852
00:59:53,308 --> 00:59:54,375
That's it, then.

853
00:59:54,777 --> 00:59:56,565
We'll be right behind
as you leave with him.

854
00:59:57,067 --> 00:59:58,052
Good luck.

855
01:00:06,275 --> 01:00:07,205
Curry speaking.

856
01:00:07,736 --> 01:00:08,792
This is Gunby.

857
01:00:09,267 --> 01:00:11,149
Is Laurie Fredericks
in her apartment now?

858
01:00:11,362 --> 01:00:13,205
I think so. We're getting
music from her room.

859
01:00:13,305 --> 01:00:14,879
Just continue your present operation.

860
01:00:15,105 --> 01:00:17,163
Pick her up immediately
and bring her to my office.

861
01:00:17,263 --> 01:00:18,021
Yes, sir.

862
01:00:18,835 --> 01:00:20,870
Gunby says to pick the
Fredericks girl right away.

863
01:00:27,106 --> 01:00:28,311
Looks like she's gone.

864
01:00:28,485 --> 01:00:29,760
Her clothes are gone, too.

865
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:31,285
Well, we'd better make a report.

866
01:00:45,664 --> 01:00:47,444
Hang up quick.
- Just a minute, Tony.

867
01:00:48,473 --> 01:00:50,304
You got a wild hair or
something? What's up?

868
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:51,629
They picked up Stewart.

869
01:00:54,268 --> 01:00:56,336
Were you there?
- No. Laurie saw it.

870
01:00:56,837 --> 01:00:59,342
Stewart was just leaving her place.
A plainclothes man took him.

871
01:00:59,508 --> 01:01:00,724
She phoned my right away.

872
01:01:00,978 --> 01:01:03,063
When did they take him?
- About an hour ago.

873
01:01:04,145 --> 01:01:05,189
Plain clothes, huh?

874
01:01:06,076 --> 01:01:07,893
Breaking Stewart out
of prison was a mistake.

875
01:01:07,993 --> 01:01:10,940
Yeah, and it's putting Secret Service
agents out on a counterfeit tip.

876
01:01:12,032 --> 01:01:14,768
How could they get a lead on us?
- How? How do they ever?

877
01:01:15,090 --> 01:01:18,821
Now Stewart's hotter than a firecracker.
He can explode and take us with him.

878
01:01:19,184 --> 01:01:20,375
Stewart will never talk.

879
01:01:20,475 --> 01:01:23,915
I don't trust anybody not to talk.
Not when the clamps are really on.

880
01:01:24,426 --> 01:01:25,799
[ Telephone ]

881
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,059
[ Telephone ]

882
01:01:32,844 --> 01:01:34,317
I wouldn't answer that, Sylvester.

883
01:01:36,212 --> 01:01:37,514
[ Telephone ]

884
01:01:37,848 --> 01:01:41,980
They're probably getting set for a
raid right now. Trying to locate you.

885
01:01:42,423 --> 01:01:44,113
[ Telephone ]

886
01:01:46,418 --> 01:01:48,001
[ Telephone ]

887
01:01:48,894 --> 01:01:51,872
Look, Sylvester. I took a
long chance to tip you off.

888
01:01:52,316 --> 01:01:54,447
We haven't got any time to waste.
- What's on your mind?

889
01:01:54,749 --> 01:01:58,232
I'm going to lose myself for good. But
first, let's go through with our deal.

890
01:01:58,637 --> 01:02:01,171
Where I'm going I can peddle all
kinds of queer without a question.

891
01:02:01,469 --> 01:02:02,685
Yeah. That's a good idea.

892
01:02:03,237 --> 01:02:04,968
I think I'll find myself
a cave somewhere.

893
01:02:05,977 --> 01:02:08,259
I'm waiting for Mack to get me.
- You won't have to wait.

894
01:02:08,359 --> 01:02:09,889
My car is downstairs. Come on.

895
01:02:16,377 --> 01:02:18,800
But operator, a minute
ago I got a busy signal.

896
01:03:16,285 --> 01:03:18,302
There's a car that's been
with us a little too long.

897
01:03:19,413 --> 01:03:20,610
Take the next corner.

898
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:39,844
Are you sure?
- Yeah, I see it.

899
01:03:39,944 --> 01:03:41,789
Take the next corner
easy and then step on it.

900
01:04:08,354 --> 01:04:10,175
Is he still behind us?
- I can't see him now.

901
01:04:10,686 --> 01:04:13,245
I thought he was going to turn with us.
- You probably imagined it.

902
01:04:13,708 --> 01:04:15,447
I never did see any car.
- Maybe.

903
01:04:16,195 --> 01:04:19,074
Stop at the first handy bar you see.
- I thought we were going to the place?

904
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:21,662
Later. Tonight.
Right now, I need a drink.

905
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:23,253
Okay.

906
01:05:00,409 --> 01:05:01,112
Hello.

907
01:05:01,544 --> 01:05:04,738
This is Jack. I guess the
Stewart girl saw him picked up.

908
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:07,134
Hackett and I are on our
way over to the plant.

909
01:05:07,234 --> 01:05:09,456
Get everything out of that
office and check with me later.

910
01:05:09,637 --> 01:05:10,309
Right.

911
01:05:20,462 --> 01:05:22,692
Looking for Tris Stewart. Is he here?
- Who are you?

912
01:05:22,986 --> 01:05:25,110
I'm his girl. I thought he was here.
- Wait a minute.

913
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:29,139
You say <i>you're</i> looking for Stewart?
- Yeah. I've got to find him right away.

914
01:05:29,482 --> 01:05:31,304
Something is wrong
here that don't add up.

915
01:05:31,404 --> 01:05:32,877
What do you mean?
- I don't know.

916
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:35,046
But I'd better let the
boss handle it. Come on.

917
01:05:35,259 --> 01:05:36,389
Can't you use a phone?

918
01:05:36,489 --> 01:05:38,749
Listen sister, where we're
going they don't use.

919
01:05:39,292 --> 01:05:41,482
How far do we have to go?
- To the car park.

920
01:05:45,666 --> 01:05:47,569
This is like looking for
a needle in a haystack.

921
01:05:48,093 --> 01:05:49,942
Try the downtown area.
We've covered this.

922
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:51,183
Yes, sir.

923
01:05:51,661 --> 01:05:54,123
With the Fredericks girl on the
loose Downey won't have a chance.

924
01:05:54,733 --> 01:05:56,435
Unless we can get to
him before she does.

925
01:06:19,595 --> 01:06:21,325
Well, you're close to transportation.

926
01:06:21,967 --> 01:06:23,340
You can always take a trolley.

927
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:25,592
When this over, I'm taking a boat.

928
01:07:07,102 --> 01:07:09,191
What's this all about?
- We're changing our plans, Al.

929
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:10,821
But you would deliver it next?

930
01:07:10,921 --> 01:07:14,193
They got Stewart. We'll do the transfer
now and go. Close the shop. Everything.

931
01:07:14,476 --> 01:07:15,243
In here.

932
01:07:17,512 --> 01:07:20,280
Finish up, boys. We're going. Pack it
all in the truck. Let's get out of here.

933
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:21,640
I'll give you a hand.

934
01:07:31,285 --> 01:07:32,331
Same as the sample.

935
01:07:33,942 --> 01:07:35,764
Yeah .. I guess so.

936
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:37,617
Alright. Let's have your money.

937
01:07:39,027 --> 01:07:41,095
Mind if I see the rest of the parcel?

938
01:07:42,232 --> 01:07:44,446
What's the matter? You afraid
we'll short change you?

939
01:07:45,877 --> 01:07:48,325
For 25 grand I like to be sure.

940
01:07:48,967 --> 01:07:49,829
No offence.

941
01:07:50,416 --> 01:07:52,567
Okay .. but don't take
all night about it.

942
01:08:11,552 --> 01:08:12,974
Come on. We'll walk from here.

943
01:08:22,773 --> 01:08:25,017
It measures up, doesn't it?
- So far, great.

944
01:08:25,672 --> 01:08:28,085
With these, I could start my
own private Marshall Plan.

945
01:08:28,569 --> 01:08:29,589
In South America.

946
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:34,334
Meet my family. Mama and Papa.

947
01:08:35,508 --> 01:08:37,056
Hey, those are beautiful.

948
01:08:37,874 --> 01:08:39,511
Mind if I take a look?
- Not at all.

949
01:08:40,029 --> 01:08:41,674
Hackett, you're looking at masterpieces.

950
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:43,883
I take great pride in these plates.

951
01:08:46,131 --> 01:08:48,489
Look at the scroll work,
the meticulous care.

952
01:08:49,008 --> 01:08:51,331
Yeah, they're real works of art.

953
01:08:51,938 --> 01:08:54,511
Treasures .. like paintings.
- I think so.

954
01:08:55,422 --> 01:08:57,764
But anyone can own prints of paintings.

955
01:08:58,633 --> 01:09:01,009
I happen to prefer the .. originals.

956
01:09:01,660 --> 01:09:03,683
At least they're
identical in that respect.

957
01:09:04,701 --> 01:09:07,070
Would you happen to know who made these?

958
01:09:07,702 --> 01:09:09,330
No .. I'm sorry.

959
01:09:10,095 --> 01:09:12,390
The artist neglected to sign his name.

960
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:14,978
Yeah, I'm sorry, too.

961
01:09:15,541 --> 01:09:17,177
Must look him up some day.

962
01:09:18,278 --> 01:09:20,873
Want to sell these?
- No. Not a chance, Hackett.

963
01:09:21,563 --> 01:09:22,893
These are my old-age pension.

964
01:09:23,824 --> 01:09:25,888
The only things better
than money are the plates.

965
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:27,700
Just make them.
- Yeah.

966
01:09:32,137 --> 01:09:34,560
Tell the boss to come out here.
I got to see him right away.

967
01:09:35,442 --> 01:09:36,086
Okay.

968
01:09:50,755 --> 01:09:53,505
Mack's outside with the girl.
He wants to see you right away.

969
01:10:02,552 --> 01:10:05,108
What's this all about? Who's she?
- This is Tris Stewart's girl.

970
01:10:05,319 --> 01:10:08,158
Why did you bring her here? You know
better than that.         - Now, listen.

971
01:10:08,258 --> 01:10:10,478
I've got to find Tris. Is he here?
- What are you saying?

972
01:10:10,578 --> 01:10:13,169
You know what happened to him.
- I haven't seen him since last night.

973
01:10:13,269 --> 01:10:14,466
Who are you kidding?

974
01:10:14,566 --> 01:10:16,290
You told Hackett you
saw him get pinched.

975
01:10:16,457 --> 01:10:18,923
I didn't tell him anything.
Don't you know Hackett is a cop?

976
01:10:19,211 --> 01:10:21,448
Ask Tris. He knows all about it.
- Hackett is a cop?

977
01:10:21,606 --> 01:10:23,882
Yes he is. We even found a
microphone in my apartment.

978
01:10:25,038 --> 01:10:26,025
You come with me.

979
01:10:26,638 --> 01:10:28,189
Get yourself lost.
- Okay.

980
01:10:37,107 --> 01:10:38,795
There is a friend of yours here, Johnny.

981
01:10:38,895 --> 01:10:40,402
Hackett, where's Tris?

982
01:10:41,829 --> 01:10:43,799
What about it? Get up.

983
01:10:44,555 --> 01:10:46,143
Harry, frisk him, Irving.
- Yes, sir.

984
01:10:54,092 --> 01:10:54,875
Fifteen.

985
01:10:56,107 --> 01:10:57,266
Chrysler convertible.

986
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,175
License, California.

987
01:10:59,457 --> 01:11:01,295

988
01:11:01,814 --> 01:11:06,520
Chrysler convertible.
License 26-X548 has been located.

989
01:11:07,103 --> 01:11:09,939
"<i>Suspect's car has now been
observed by a motorcycle officer</i>."

990
01:11:10,844 --> 01:11:13,731
"<i>Across from the LA Time company.

SS 742.

992
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:19,141
Request the officer to stand
by until he can be contacted.

993
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:23,244
Okay.

994
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:29,708
You're all washed up, copper.
- Just a minute, Sylvester.

995
01:11:29,972 --> 01:11:32,190
There was more than
one car tailing us today.

996
01:11:32,522 --> 01:11:33,881
They are ready to move in now.

997
01:11:34,026 --> 01:11:36,272
You won't get as far as the
stairs if you pull that trigger.

998
01:11:36,438 --> 01:11:37,780
I'm used to taking chances.

999
01:11:37,971 --> 01:11:40,310
Counterfeiting is one thing.
Murder is another.

1000
01:11:40,481 --> 01:11:41,987
Don't put a noose around your neck.

1001
01:11:42,087 --> 01:11:44,970
They'll hang the whole lot of you. That
includes you, Laurie. You're part of it.

1002
01:11:45,070 --> 01:11:47,796
I'm not part of anything.
- You <i>are</i> part of it, like it or not.

1003
01:11:48,017 --> 01:11:50,186
You're in a bad spot, Laurie
and it's going to get worse.

1004
01:11:50,365 --> 01:11:52,333
I only came here to
find Tris. Where is he?

1005
01:11:52,524 --> 01:11:55,552
I'll tell you. We locked him up because
he didn't keep his part of the bargain.

1006
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:58,658
He tried to double-cross
you and me both, Sylvester.

1007
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:01,302
Don't you see? You can't
even trust your own pals.

1008
01:12:07,945 --> 01:12:09,549
It looks like I can't trust anybody.

1009
01:12:09,769 --> 01:12:11,490
He had to do it to get out of jail.

1010
01:12:11,748 --> 01:12:14,572
That's right. The Police are powerful.
They can make you do almost anything.

1011
01:12:15,585 --> 01:12:17,019
Like, talk out of turn.

1012
01:12:18,466 --> 01:12:20,608
I guess you are a part of this
and you aren't a plant.

1013
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,293
I hate to see you getting in any deeper.

1014
01:12:23,837 --> 01:12:25,157
You're in deep enough.

1015
01:12:43,581 --> 01:12:45,369
Throw a cordon around the block.
- Yes, sir.

1016
01:13:24,094 --> 01:13:25,110
You try that area.

1017
01:13:38,463 --> 01:13:39,721
You try that side, John.

1018
01:13:45,718 --> 01:13:46,638
0ver here.

1019
01:13:48,913 --> 01:13:50,452
You two go with agent Downey.

1020
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:52,094
You two stay with me.

1021
01:16:21,917 --> 01:16:23,280
There he is!

1022
01:16:25,744 --> 01:16:27,002
Alright, Sylvester.

1023
01:16:27,494 --> 01:16:28,713
Put up your hands.

1024
01:16:30,087 --> 01:16:31,422
Don't shoot.

1025
01:16:32,557 --> 01:16:33,411
Don't shoot!

1026
01:16:33,701 --> 01:16:34,871
Sylvester, look out.

1027
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:50,302
Send for the Coroner.

1028
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:56,375
Is that contraband inventory
ready yet on last night's raid?

1029
01:16:56,595 --> 01:16:58,143
"<i>Yes, sir</i>."
- Alright. Bring it in.

1030
01:16:59,310 --> 01:17:01,413
Have any trouble identifying
he rest of the gang, John?

1031
01:17:01,539 --> 01:17:03,650
Not a bit. Those are
faces I'll never forget.

1032
01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:05,384
I'll bet you won't.

1033
01:17:05,782 --> 01:17:07,618
Put it down over here.
- Yes, sir.

1034
01:17:07,974 --> 01:17:10,296
Here is the money and the plates.
And this is the inventory.

1035
01:17:10,851 --> 01:17:11,563
Fine.

1036
01:17:14,175 --> 01:17:15,248
Sylvester was right.

1037
01:17:16,028 --> 01:17:17,238
These are works of art.

1038
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:19,728
$240,000 in twenty-dollar bills.

1039
01:17:20,639 --> 01:17:21,949
Feel like counting it again?

1040
01:17:22,222 --> 01:17:24,504
No thanks .. I did that last night.

1041
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,335
I know every one of
those bills personally.

1042
01:17:27,815 --> 01:17:29,723
Everything's in order.
Send these to Washington.

1043
01:17:29,823 --> 01:17:30,626
Yes, sir.

1044
01:17:32,930 --> 01:17:34,915
Well, I guess that
closes the Stewart case.

1045
01:17:58,130 --> 01:17:58,865
-(t-g)-
