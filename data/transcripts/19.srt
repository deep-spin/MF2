1
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:30,131
ALARM AT THE BORDER

2
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:24,019
TREASURY DEPARTMENT
CUSTOMS AGENCY

3
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,137
Sit down.

4
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:43,050
Take off his handcuffs.

5
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,096
Where did they start with all this?

6
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,617
Take them and lock them up.

7
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,615
- I don't have anything to do with this.
- And who does?

8
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,258
He said that I only had to
make it look like I was his wife.

9
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,536
No one told me that
we were going to smuggle drugs.

10
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,610
- I didn't even know him.
- Don't listen to her. She's a trickster.

11
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:14,529
- If only Big Richard heard you now.
- Let's talk about Big Richard.

12
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,808
Be quiet, Elaine

13
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,612
So, you two are a couple
of Big Richard's toursits.

14
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,459
I'm not saying anything. I have rights.

15
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:25,776
- And you?
- Me neither.

16
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:30,691
We have enough proof
to get the both of you.

17
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,853
Umm...

18
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:37,336
Has Richard's influence
gone that far?

19
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,808
No, he has other things to do
than spend his money on stupid things

20
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,451
- You should tell him everything.
- And you shouldn't do it.

21
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,017
Everything was going fine until
I met you and your friends.

22
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,417
- Come on! Hit me!
- Put him the cell.

23
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,459
Are you thinking about talking?

24
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:05,331
- If I feel like it, sure.
- Do you know Big Richard?

25
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:09,853
That depends, Big Richard
and I are good friends.

26
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,293
Where does he get the drugs? How does
he deliver them?

27
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,689
Under the upholstery in other people's
cars.

28
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,538
- Who are these other people?
- Richard doesn't even know.

29
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:30,060
- Who did they have to meet?
- You don't meet them, they find you.

30
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,053
Ok, you're going to be spending a lot of
time alone.

31
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:37,452
Try to concentrate and
give us more answers.

32
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,493
- That's all.
- Over here, miss.

33
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,093
Even though the cargo proves it,
we still don't have enough proof.

34
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:53,770
I guess we'll have to
start all over again.

35
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:57,969
Start from the beginning, huh? We're
not going to get anything from these

36
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,292
- How can you say that?
- This is Madelaine Haley.

37
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,736
From the Los Angeles
police department.

38
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,334
- How are you?
- How are you?

39
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,457
She's good, without her
we wouldn't have hunted those two

40
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:11,858
And I've even had men in Mexico for
months

41
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,293
Richard can sense a detective
from miles a way.

42
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:18,288
Yeah, he's very shrewd when
it comes to our men.

43
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,970
- What about our women?
- That's not such a bad idea.

44
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,008
- Richard wouldn't even think of it.
- I have my notes right here.

45
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,899
- I've discovered something.
- A discovery?

46
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,331
- That Richard is addicted to women?
- Yes, that's true.

47
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,416
- What is Jackie Curtin working on now?
- She's not pretty enough.

48
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,536
Let's see, Lili would be perfect,
but she got married and left.

49
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,973
- And what about Judy Michaels?
- She went back to work and won't be

50
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,298
What about her?
- Yea

51
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,780
No, Richard likes
vulgar women.

52
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,772
But she could pass.

53
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,499
What are we even talking about?
Narcotics

54
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,290
Yeah, but we could send her
to Mexico with some other excuse

55
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,812
- Besides, the boss likes it.
- It could be an option.

56
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:12,209
I'll think about it. Maybe she could
get some valuable in formation.

57
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,771
- Do you think she can do it?
- Yeah.

58
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,692
During the war, she was part of
Special Services in the US.

59
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,419
She speaks Mexican pretty well.

60
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,891
- How do you spell your last name?
- H-A-L-E-Y

61
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,656
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

62
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,213
Popcorn.

63
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,296
Popcorn.

64
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,531
Popcorn.

65
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,617
Popcorn.

66
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,618
Popcorn.

67
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,092
Popcorn.

68
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,453
Four beers.

69
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,169
- Terrible.
- Over and over again.

70
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,289
- It's always the same thing.
- It's a mess.

71
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,812
Pass me the lipstick.
- Sure.

72
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:45,093
Her eyes were like the moonlight.
Her lips redder than wine.

73
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:55,288
And even though she told me that she
loved me,

74
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:08,293
Lips redder than wine.

75
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:21,811
I knew she would never be mine.

76
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:28,775
The more I longed for her kisses,
the more she smiled.

77
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:35,017
I knew I shouldn't wink at her.

78
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:49,370
She could dazzle me with her smile

79
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:03,014
A smile she dedicated to me for a
moment

80
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:10,130
Even though she stole my heart,
she left me with that smile

81
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:17,373
Men smile because she has
also taken their hearts.

82
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:30,569
They sing that
she stole their hearts too.

83
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:38,259
Her eyes were like the moonlight.
Her lips redder than wine.

84
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:45,054
I know she's a devil dressed as an angel.
Who crosses at the border.

85
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:59,538
Lips redder than wine.

86
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:13,214
On this road,
just past the border.

87
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:21,176
No, don't do that.
No, do what I tell you.

88
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,332
Ok.

89
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,816
It's a trick.

90
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,450
Do exactly what I tell you
and there won't be any problems.

91
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,858
Yes, it was my people
did it last night.

92
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,175
- Cigarettes, please.
- Ok.

93
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,289
- Thanks.
- Wait until we find it.

94
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,451
I'll talk to you later.

95
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,539
Got a light?

96
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,499
Give her a light.

97
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,293
- Go up to the room in case they call.
- Sure boss. I got it.

98
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,776
- Look what you made me do.
- Sorry. Try it again.

99
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,975
- Unless you're afraid of getting burnt.
- I don't care about getting burnt.

100
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,733
- But, where are you going?
- I have to go upstairs.

101
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,294
You know what?
You're not so bad.

102
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,657
Finish the drink.

103
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:55,056
Why don't you have another one?
For the road... with me.

104
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,657
Sure.

105
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,050
- I can't.
- Sure you can.

106
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,534
- I can?
- Yeah, of course.

107
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:34,295
Which...? No. Look.
Which room?

108
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,539
This one.

109
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,212
Hang in there.

110
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,453
Give me the keys.

111
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,176
- The keys?
- Yes, the keys.

112
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,293
Wait a second.
Just a second.

113
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,298
No.
You, you stay here.

114
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,050
There we go. No.
Wait.

115
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,178
I just want you to be comfortable.

116
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,534
No.

117
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,335
We're going to celebrate.

118
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,530
Come on, inside.

119
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,973
- Hey Boss.
- Stupid.

120
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,533
Hi.

121
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,412
Who's the girl?

122
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,456
- A friend of mine.
- Get rid of her.

123
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,690
- She's a friend.
- Get her out of here.

124
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,854
You!

125
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:38,056
- You're not going to pay attention to
him, right?

126
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,496
Fine.

127
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:07,331
Don't think this was all in fun.
I'll see you around.

128
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,413
I hope you don't think we're being rude.

129
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,379
No.

130
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,536
Come by tomorrow.
Then we won't be strangers.

131
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,056
You're very nice.

132
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,978
You'll find me even nicer
once you get to know me better.

133
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,019
I would really like to get you better.

134
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,419
- What do you want, McClan?
- You know what I want.

135
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:42,888
Did you send Harvey Gambin? How is he?
I've been trying to get a hold of him.

136
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,655
We could do a little business together.

137
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,253
Pick it up, Joe.

138
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,900
Come on, tell me what you want.

139
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:12,373
Harvey says you have a shipment
ready. He says he wants it.

140
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,853
Tell Harvey...

141
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,976
The only thing I'm going to tell him
is which boat it's in.

142
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:23,414
You will give the in formation, won't you?

143
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:30,817
What if we convince him? A little
dust on the arm. He'll like that.

144
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:34,177
- Sometimes, it makes the skin crawl.
- It doesn't sound bad.

145
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,337
- Are you trying to scare me, Johnny?
- You Richard? Never.

146
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,414
You're too thick skinned,
but I don't think she'll put up with it.

147
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,128
She doesn't know anything.
Who was going to tell her?

148
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,776
That's for sure. Who told
me nothing? I don't know.

149
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,729
- What about you, Ducey?
- She hasn't told me anything. Only he

150
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,578
Tie him up.

151
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:06,260
- Boss, tell him I don't know anything.
- That's true Ducey, you don't know

152
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:38,532
Why don't you tell us, Ritchie and
you'll save all this?

153
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,529
You'd sell your own life for
a few bucks, wouldn't you?

154
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,454
Maybe it's you
who'd sell it, McClan.

155
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,375
"It's in the port;
in the northern part."

156
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,179
Is it grey?

157
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,058
I asked you
if it's grey.

158
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,568
Yes.

159
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,532
Is it anchored in up high?

160
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:28,296
- Pretty much, like it always is, McClan.
- Good. I knew it would be there.

161
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,889
It works a well as
truth serum.

162
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:33,133
2, 5, 1,

163
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,179
Someday you're luck is
going to run out, McClan.

164
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,691
McClan here.
It's a boat. In the northern part.

165
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:43,571
Yeah, that's it.
I'll do it.

166
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,376
Harvey, I want to thank you.
Do you want to say something to

167
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:53,776
He says "you're welcome", Harvey.
See you later buddy.

168
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,290
I told you one of these days
you're luck was going to run out.

169
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,100
Wait a second.
Richard, wait.

170
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,130
Thanks, doll.
I want to talk to you.

171
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,898
- I don't know anything.
- Come on.

172
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:26,129
- Could you tell me how to get out of
here?

173
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,738
Yea, over there.

174
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,372
You, come here!

175
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,768
Come here!

176
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,129
You move faster
when you're carrying a gun.

177
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,338
- The boss wants to talk to you.
- He seems strong and brave.

178
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,418
- Sit down.
- Why did you hit me?

179
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,890
I had to.
Or else I wouln't have been able to bring

180
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,893
That's why I did it.

181
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,572
Want a cigarette?

182
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,051
How long have you been
working for Richard?

183
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,849
He asked you... how long have you been
with Richard?

184
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,855
- 5 minutes.
- You want us to believe that?

185
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,172
- It's true.
- Give her a second to explain.

186
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,778
- Have you ever made a trip for Ritchie?
- What trip?

187
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,775
To get the merchandise to the other side
of the border.

188
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,620
Boss, I think we should
get rid of her. I'll go by myself.

189
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,698
I don't want you to it by yourself,
Johnny.

190
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,694
You know, husband and wife.
Make it look respectable.

191
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:42,176
- I'll get you guys a tourist visa.
We'll see how she works.

192
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,338
Any woman will behave well
if the pay is good.

193
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:52,214
- Be ready to leave early tomorrow
morning.

194
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,216
Go on, tell him something.

195
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,771
How much am I going to make from this?
See. She knows what she wants...

196
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,137
- Miguel!
- What?

197
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,488
Go the hotel, pay the lady's bill
and get her luggage. What's your

198
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,657
- Clarice La Rue.
- What?

199
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:20,655
- Clarice La Rue.
- Clarice La Rue, sir.

200
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,610
- Good morning, Don Pancho.
- Good morning.

201
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,929
Make sure you're there Friday,
at noon, at the Los Angeles Zoo.

202
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,255
OK.

203
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:04,613
But I still don't know who
I'm supposed to meet there.

204
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,219
You'll find out when you get there.

205
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,778
Noon, in front of the monkey
cage. Got it?

206
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:13,290
- Got it. Get in the car.
- Got it.

207
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,810
- Let's go Miguel.
- Yes sir.

208
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:57,411
Miguel, you're in charge of these two
make sure they get through the border

209
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,533
Yes, sir.

210
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:35,613
Casa Hermosa is the best hotel.
The rooms have bathrooms and hot

211
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,054
- What town is this?
- Hidalgo. We're going to sleep here.

212
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,978
Move it.

213
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,579
Wait.

214
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,251
- Do you know what this is?
- Of course.

215
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,692
Put it on. It's part of the tourist pass.
Put it on. It part of the job.

216
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,809
Congratulations!

217
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,779
Yeah, man!

218
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:10,013
- Good afternoon.
- Do you have any rooms available?

219
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,411
Yes, they're all available.
Welcome to Casa Hermosa.

220
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,777
We always try to treat
the Americans the best we can.

221
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,778
Give us a room facing the street.

222
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:29,128
OK. Mr. And Mrs. Smith.
This way.

223
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,412
- Can you bring us the luggage?
- Of course. Bye.

224
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:59,459
- Are you looking for someone?
- No. Just the police, the feds.

225
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,977
Or the town security, or an
assailant, or Richard's guys.

226
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,099
Don't you think we should've
got two rooms?

227
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,570
- Why?
- To be safe.

228
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,891
Safe from what?

229
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,855
Let's get this straight
I'm not going to...

230
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:18,494
Relax.

231
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,649
How do you expect to enjoy your
honeymoon if you can't relax?

232
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,734
I just want you to know. This
is strictly out of convience.

233
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,931
Right.
We are strictly married.

234
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:29,768
Miguel!

235
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:48,570
- That's great music.
- Where can we get some food around

236
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:56,538
- Who is it?
- Felipe!

237
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,136
Come in.

238
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,536
- Where should I put them?
Over there, on the chair.

239
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,458
Good.

240
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:08,137
I hope you're happy.
Only the best for the Americans.

241
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,452
Thanks.

242
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,055
Now you know why
Miguel is such a great guide.

243
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,610
- Should we eat?
- Yes, let 's go.

244
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,658
Lock it.

245
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,779
Be quiet!

246
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:24,416
Tell Mary we'll be at
the hotel at the border on Thursday.

247
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:28,978
With the narcotics load.
Joe and Ritchie McEvoy's girl.

248
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:35,291
Arrive Thursday at border with narcotics
load and Ritchie's girl.

249
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:45,017
Hi, Juanito?
I just bought some food.

250
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,417
Sausage, cheese, ham a little bit of
everything.

251
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:52,133
- Did you get yourself something?
- Yeah, this and this.

252
00:32:54,260 --> 00:33:00,813
- A telegram for your loved one.
- No. It's for my mother, it's her

253
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,535
A lot of these days,
huh, Juanito?

254
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,335
- Miguel.
- What?

255
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,489
Stay near the car tonight.
In case we need to get out of here

256
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,970
- Yes, sir.
- 12 pesos, sir.

257
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,812
Thanks.

258
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,740
- Wait. Your reciept.
- Don't worry about it.

259
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,259
Open up, it's me.

260
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,779
- Hungry?
- It's the wedding feast.

261
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:05,532
- Don't talk to any strangers.
- I don't know any strangers.

262
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,291
Open up!

263
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,292
I'm listening to you eat.

264
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,415
Sound likes its good.

265
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,489
- What do you do when you're hungry?
- Eat?

266
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,499
- Take some.
- Thanks.

267
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:43,652
And when I'm thirsty?
- There's a glass over there.

268
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,890
What's your name?
I mean, you're real name.

269
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,139
Why the hell do you want
to know my name?

270
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,259
I bet you're from Kansas or Missouri.
Where are you from?

271
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,171
Here and there.

272
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,773
My favorite place.
That's where I'm from too.

273
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:55,779
- I was just going to turn off the light.
- I was going to too.

274
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,649
By shooting it?

275
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,451
Good night to you too.

276
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:46,135
Who is it?
Miguel.

277
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,929
Sir, they're coming.
They're here.

278
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,579
Richard?
Yes.

279
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,413
Is the car outside?
Yes, sir.

280
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,493
Go out through the window. We'll pass
everything to you. Hurry.

281
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,414
Where's Felipe?
Right here.

282
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,373
Thanks.

283
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,579
What are you doing?
I can't go out like this.

284
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,691
Are you crazy? Come on.

285
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,579
We were so close.

286
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:02,175
If Miguel doesn't get back before
Richard does, you'll see.

287
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,093
He's going to try to con fuse him, isn't
he?

288
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,812
But, what if it doesn't work?

289
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,934
Then we'll be in a big mess.

290
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,578
Hide!

291
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:32,779
Good afternoon,
Mr. And Mrs. McClan.

292
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:56,579
I still can't believe it.
You've got a lot of class.

293
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,169
When you believe it
you got it.

294
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:05,250
You must have traveled with better
company

295
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,094
What do you
mean by good company?

296
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,899
All my life I've ridden a horse between 2
countries.

297
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:16,448
That's what I figured. I guess
we can share some of our in formation

298
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:21,610
Like what?
Like, who Harvey's connections are.

299
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,528
Where to get the merchandise,
who it is given to.

300
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:28,819
I forgot to tell you,
I also know how to keep quiet in two

301
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,299
Be careful!

302
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,091
Move your cart so we can get through.

303
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:45,090
Hey man!
It's blocking the road.

304
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:49,172
Quick!
Hurry!

305
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,570
We were almost there and
now all this is going to hold us up.

306
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,334
He's knows more than you think.

307
00:42:55,900 --> 00:43:00,815
She's a good gal, McClan, even though
she isn't so smart sticking around with

308
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,419
I wouldn't say the same about her,
Richard.

309
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,530
I hope you don't
have a reason to live.

310
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:12,570
Well, I can think of at least 3.
I told you you're luck would change.

311
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:16,898
Look, maybe we could make a deal.
A deal?

312
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,211
Nobody can say that
I didn't make you laugh.

313
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:26,413
Quiet! What's this?
It's on fire!

314
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:31,252
Help me! The horses!
Help!

315
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,291
Get the car.

316
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,937
Can't you go any faster?
I would if I could.

317
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,290
Don't tell me that Miguel
went back to sleep.

318
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,258
He's not sleeping.

319
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:23,617
Aren't you going to stop?
Not while I still have gas.

320
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,058
Do you have a cigarette?

321
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:43,132
Sorry for the trip I'm giving you.

322
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:16,020
Since we have the drugs and the body in
the car, all we need now is the police.

323
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:19,291
They're getting closer quickly.

324
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:37,090
Why are you stopping?
Have you ever tried to con fuse one of...

325
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:39,814
those Mexican police?
It's impossible.

326
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,774
What's the emergency man?
We have an ill man with us.

327
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:52,416
We need a doctor, quick!
Follow me.

328
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,173
What?
Follow me.

329
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:00,056
And they told me that you weren't that
smart.

330
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:04,053
If I was, I would be working
in the factory with my dad.

331
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:37,018
A dead end.

332
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,255
What happened?
Get up.

333
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:11,978
Hi, Jose, how are you?
Good, man.

334
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:20,052
Come with me.
I lost two Americans around here.

335
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,012
Hurry, let's go,
come on.

336
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,732
Don't go man.

337
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:38,416
Have you seen two Americans come
through here?

338
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,339
Stop!

339
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,049
We got lost. Please, hurry,
this man is really ill.

340
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:52,571
His stomach hurts.
We found him on the road.

341
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,618
Doctor!
Follow me. Don't get lost.

342
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:56,816
Ok.

343
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:01,289
I want some more beer.

344
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:04,856
This man isn't
ill, he's drunk.

345
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:10,538
Drunk?
Let's go.

346
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:14,531
I thought he was sick.
Your tourist visa, sir.

347
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:16,173
Yes, of course.

348
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,978
Mr. And Mrs. John "McClein.
McClan."

349
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:29,179
Yes. We're on our honeymoon.
Newlyweds.

350
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,333
Congratulations.
Congratulations.

351
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:34,532
Thank you.
Have a good honeymoon.

352
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,372
Bye
Bye.

353
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,051
Love is beautiful no matter where you
are.

354
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:49,811
They will look for us if they find Miguel's
body.

355
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,698
Good, are you ready?
Yes?

356
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:03,137
Give me a hand.
I can't do it myself.

357
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,579
There it goes!

358
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:14,133
Good.
That's it. Let's go.

359
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:24,575
"Airport. 10 km." Let's go.
How many miles are 10 km?

360
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:26,771
Do you know the conversion?
Yeah.

361
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:29,250
10 km is about 6 or 7 miles.

362
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:40,294
I knew I'd be happy with
a smart guy like you. 7 miles.

363
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,930
It can't be more than 5 and a half now.

364
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:46,496
Five and a half! Why didn't you
crash the car a little closer to the

365
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:52,172
Let's sit down.
Someone will pass by soon.

366
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:55,777
Maybe they can take us.
With Big Ritchie.

367
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:16,257
What a great way to escape.
You're the one who picked it.

368
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:21,812
I know what I'm doing. Do you?
I'm running away.

369
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:28,090
You'll get tired, won't you?
No.

370
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:40,209
How long have you been doing this?
Let's see, I started in nursery school

371
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:46,696
So, it's been a while now. What about
you?

372
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:54,050
I was destined to be a criminal when
I was 7 or 8.

373
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:59,497
I learned everything so
I wouldn't be conned. I got into this

374
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,739
I met Harvey and
I've been with him ever since.

375
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,250
Get your stuff, quick!

376
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,530
He was in a hurry.

377
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,374
What happened after nursery school?

378
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:59,136
When I was a teenager, I ran away
and a month later I met Rocky.

379
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:03,616
Who's Rocky?
The only man I've ever kissed.

380
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:11,615
I felt so bad seeing him hanging there
over the cold cement, dead.

381
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:15,012
What happened to him?
I shot him.

382
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:19,651
I promised I'd never go back
to kissing girls.

383
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:23,528
Does that answer your question?

384
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,498
Someone's coming.

385
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:46,971
Good morning. Where are you going?
To the airport, our car stalled.

386
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,616
Do you speak English?
Yes, why?

387
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,733
I don't understand your Spanish
that well.

388
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:58,808
We are trying to get to the airport.
The bus didn't stop to pick us up.

389
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:03,730
This is Tomas. He's always in a hurry.
Get in.

390
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:05,498
Thanks.

391
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,498
I'll sit here.

392
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:22,138
Can we go?
Si, I mean, "yes"

393
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:29,690
I was a teacher for 3 years
and I was a water inspector.

394
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:35,455
Now I own 40 acres
of land and have 12 kids.

395
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:38,420
12 kids?
That's a lot of acres!

396
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:42,250
That's very interesting, but is there
an airline that crosses over the border?

397
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:47,773
No, but don't worry. I'll take care of
everything. I'm an important man.

398
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:52,019
I have a friend. A pilot.
Does he have his own plane?

399
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:55,970
A little one.

400
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:59,696
Do you have money?
Yes, a little, just a little.

401
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,853
Ok. Good.

402
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:16,932
Why are we stopping?
Yes, sir. I have a phone.

403
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:21,692
I'm going to call Pablo at the airport.
Thanks.

404
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,971
I'll be right back.

405
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:30,738
I hope no one is keeping an eye on the
airpot.

406
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,572
You're right.

407
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:39,299
My dad welcomes you.

408
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,611
Thanks.
Thanks.

409
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:50,532
Hi!
You should be fumigated!

410
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:54,777
This woman has no idea.
About modern advancements.

411
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:59,172
Give it to me. I can hear better.
You're driving me crazy.

412
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:02,579
Hello!

413
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:06,418
Hello!
My wife. She butts into everything.

414
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:09,489
I understand.
Look!

415
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:14,730
What a nice clothesline.
It's not a clothesline.

416
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:17,176
It's a telephone cable.

417
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:31,689
I can't hear you, Pablo. Talk louder.
They're welcome here.

418
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:34,893
Pablitio is one the phone
if you want to talk to him.

419
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,812
Thanks.

420
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,537
Hi Pablito.

421
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:56,769
That's fine, Pablito. Good.
We're going to pay him 75 dollars.

422
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,330
Ok.

423
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:02,736
I'll take them.
OK.

424
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:08,177
What's this?
This?

425
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:12,773
One more thing, sir.
I'm also the oldest alguacil.

426
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:17,975
That's like a "sheriff", right?
Yes, I'm an important man.

427
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:20,296
Yes, you are.
But not a very modest one.

428
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,934
That's all right. Excuse me.

429
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:25,657
Hello?

430
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:31,772
Hello?
Let me talk. I can hear better.

431
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:36,736
She does everything better.
I'm going to fix the line. I'll be back

432
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,492
Hello?
Can you hear me?

433
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:46,979
Tell Portillo to go to the
airport right away.

434
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,972
Hello?

435
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:57,014
It's the police.
I'm going to take my clothes off the line.

436
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:06,615
Hello? What did you say?
Yes, we can hear better.

437
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:17,098
Hello?
Portillo is fixing the wire.

438
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,933
Hurry up. I need to use the phone.

439
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:34,254
And he should keep an eye out for two
murderers

440
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:38,857
Yes, I'll tell him. Bye.
Did you get the message?

441
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:41,729
There are two criminals around
suspected of murderer.

442
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:42,895
No.

443
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:45,490
You have to get to the airport
and make sure they don't escape.

444
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:47,929
Of course, but
who am I looking for?

445
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,295
I'm calling the police.
I have a description.

446
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,810
It's a man and a woman. The man is
tall, elegant and well dressed...

447
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:56,330
with dark hair and good manners.
Yes.

448
00:57:56,780 --> 00:58:00,614
And the woman is short,
with a pointy nose, brown skin...

449
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:06,060
and a green glass eye.
Right. They can't escape Portillo.

450
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,969
We've got to hurry.
We have to get to the airport.

451
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:13,897
Bye.

452
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:18,452
Bye.
Bye, sweety.

453
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:22,290
Bye.
What are you waiting for?

454
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,133
This is it.

455
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:45,178
Let's go!

456
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:05,939
When are we leaving, Pablito?
In a second, sir.

457
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:11,216
What happened to the sheriff?
He's still searching the entrance.

458
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,815
Looking for a fat, short,
woman with long hair.

459
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:16,051
Don't be offended.

460
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:19,419
What is Pablito doing?
Trying to jinx our luck?

461
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:21,970
We would be better off if the police
didn't rush our friend.

462
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:25,008
They've cut all the
telephone lines.

463
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:27,298
We can leave whenever you want.

464
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:31,051
I guess our next
stop will be after the border.

465
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:33,331
Yes, the border.

466
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:37,410
The parrot can come with me,
OK

467
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:58,777
Portillo told me that
you have to get back to work right

468
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:00,652
Right?
Yes.

469
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,572
Portillo told me that
you like birds.

470
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:05,618
Yes.
How long have you been married?

471
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:07,333
3 weeks.
5 weeks.

472
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:13,013
Newlyweds should talk more.

473
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,454
We're trying, right honey?

474
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:53,091
What's going on?
Look what he's doing, eating.

475
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:57,249
What's wrong with that?
Do you think he'll give me some? I'm

476
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,458
Again?
You just ate last night.

477
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:08,051
We're out of gas.
Gas?

478
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:11,298
We're out in one tank.
I'm going to check the other one.

479
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:21,578
I thought you filled them both.
Don't worry.

480
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:25,774
Great. What do we do now?
I'll land on the beach.

481
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:29,300
You can't land on the beach.
Isn't the sand too soft?

482
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:31,655
It's not too soft for me.

483
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:24,328
Better?
I feel weak.

484
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:28,053
Excuse me, sir
can you help me please?

485
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:30,492
Don't go anywhere.

486
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:34,655
How long will it take to fill them?
10 minutes.

487
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:37,368
Can you do it in 5?
Yes.

488
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:40,088
But, we'll have to clear
some of the sand before we take off.

489
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:43,497
Do we have to wait until dark?
Not tonight.

490
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:46,613
It's too dark. We'll do it tomorrow.
Tomorrow?

491
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:49,340
What are we going to do about food?
That's a problem.

492
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:54,370
All I have is a pack of cereal.
What flavor?

493
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,816
Something good.

494
01:03:18,780 --> 01:03:22,819
Why don't you sit down and take it easy.
Dinner will take a while.

495
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:30,977
Ham and eggs, and
tomorrow hot biscuits and lots of coffee.

496
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:34,337
Are you ok?
It's nothing. I like to dream.

497
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:39,254
Is there a motel in Ensenada?
One for tourists.

498
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:42,416
Isn't that what we are?

499
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:47,255
Want me to tell you something?
No, I'll tell you.

500
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:52,133
We're a bunch of idiots.
With a thousand policemen chasing us.

501
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:57,098
And my friends from the south
and our fish dinner.

502
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:00,251
Who made the bet?

503
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:09,215
You know, you're a smart girl.
Sometimes I have a feeling...

504
01:04:09,460 --> 01:04:14,932
that you haven't told me everyting.
You know what? I have that same

505
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:20,213
I don't think you
learned to fish in jail.

506
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:24,019
I learned to fish in school.

507
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:27,500
My father used to take me
fishing on Sundays.

508
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:30,938
A few days ago
I would have believed you.

509
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:35,415
Why don't you tonight?
I don't know.

510
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:41,858
You seem like the hardened type.
But not so much now.

511
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:47,459
I believed a few things
about you too that I don't now.

512
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:01,216
Good morning. Welcome.

513
01:05:09,340 --> 01:05:11,570
It's beautiful!
I told you.

514
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:15,933
I didn't think you knew about these kinds
of places.

515
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:18,850
What made you so clever, Johnny?

516
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:24,572
This way please.

517
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:58,572
Can I take your bags
to your room, sir?

518
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:01,015
No, leave them here.

519
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,255
Thank you, Mr. Jackson.

520
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:18,412
Mr. Jackson?
I'm like a phone book.

521
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:27,009
I must be going crazy.
That makes two of us.

522
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:38,450
It's a beautiful room
For 125 bucks it should be.

523
01:06:39,220 --> 01:06:42,530
How long are we staying?
We'll cross the border tomorrow.

524
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:45,899
Do you have a plan?
The Gambin Plan.

525
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:49,140
We'll leave
the box with them and go.

526
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:53,249
They'll ask us to pay tax.
We'll refuse, they'll insist and we'll leave

527
01:06:54,580 --> 01:06:57,174
What about the bird cage?
Won't it be a problem?

528
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:00,412
No. It's against the
law to take birds over the border.

529
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:05,777
We'll argue with them, take the
cage, and leave the bird.

530
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:11,649
They'll insist and you'll refuse.
Not me. I never argue.

531
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,773
Do we have to leave tomorrow?

532
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:26,414
Yes. I have to...

533
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:31,130
I'll see you downstairs, at the bar.

534
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:53,697
Thank you.
A pack of cigarettes, please.

535
01:07:58,260 --> 01:08:00,216
And a few of these cigars.

536
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:10,132
Thank you.

537
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:28,730
Hello Alonso
Hello Johnny.

538
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:32,649
Do you have the police under control?
We would, if it weren't for a few

539
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:35,210
gringos' who never
take a break from being stupid al the

540
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:38,890
Is Big Richard following me?
Yes, he's in the city.

541
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:43,093
In the city? That's good.
I'll try to get him to cross the border.

542
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:46,657
What's going on with Harvey Gambin?
Get ready to grab him.

543
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:49,620
I think we know
everything we need to about our Mr.

544
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:52,613
Good.
Who's the girl with you?

545
01:08:52,940 --> 01:08:56,933
She used to work for Richard. We're on
the

546
01:08:57,940 --> 01:09:02,616
I'm going to leave her at the border.
I hope it goes well.

547
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:06,575
You know it's illegal to carry drugs
even for an officer of the law, right?

548
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:10,013
I know,
but you have to take risks.

549
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:13,178
Do you want a key to my room?
I already have one.

550
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:23,533
Hello?

551
01:09:38,980 --> 01:09:41,210
Hello?
I want to place a call...

552
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:43,855
to the US border agents.

553
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:49,659
Hello?

554
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:54,855
Yes, I'll connect you.
Mr. Peterson.

555
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:59,730
It's for you.
It's McEvoy calling from Ensenada.

556
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:06,299
This is Peterson.

557
01:10:08,260 --> 01:10:11,855
I'll call narcotics in
Los Angeles.

558
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:18,414
What should I do with the girl?
Leave her there, detained.

559
01:10:18,820 --> 01:10:21,539
I'll go by myself to Los Angels.

560
01:10:41,540 --> 01:10:43,132
What's up man?

561
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:47,449
You look nice.
Thanks.

562
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:51,015
Let's sit at a table.

563
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:02,777
I ordered you a daiquiri.
How did you know?

564
01:11:04,540 --> 01:11:08,089
I like your dress.
It looks very nice on you.

565
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:12,018
It's a costume.
It could very useful fro you.

566
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:27,660
You shouldn't
drink out of such a short straw.

567
01:11:27,980 --> 01:11:29,936
I'll be careful.

568
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:41,652
I didn't know you were a musician.
Like the one in "Martini"

569
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:45,294
You're full of surprises.

570
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:47,659
I am.

571
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:50,736
That's me.
Where are you going?

572
01:11:50,980 --> 01:11:52,618
I'm going to look for the car.
I want to see something.

573
01:11:52,860 --> 01:11:54,771
Now? I thought...
Richard is in the city.

574
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:58,376
We should cross the border.
Stay here until I get back.

575
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:11,338
McClan.
I wouldn't do it. Go on.

576
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:15,175
Where?
Try going towards the elevator.

577
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:28,091
You're doing great.

578
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:41,890
What floor?
Third.

579
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:49,657
Are you enjoying your stay?
It's wonderful.

580
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:05,819
Open up.
I'll get it.

581
01:13:23,540 --> 01:13:25,098
You're under arrest, Richard.

582
01:13:26,780 --> 01:13:29,374
You're very kind.
Did you fall from a tree?

583
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:32,493
Now, he's playing that he's a cop.
Hands up.

584
01:13:32,740 --> 01:13:36,210
Up, now!
He has another one in the sling.

585
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:40,172
He's a cop.
That's what the badge says.

586
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:43,857
I've had a thousand chances
to kill you, dirty, sell out cop.

587
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:52,618
Is this your gun?
Yes.

588
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:55,659
Take them out the back door.
Walk.

589
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:04,896
Thank you for having
acted like true gansters.

590
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:08,975
In the name of the Mexican government
of Baja California, you're welcome.

591
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:35,176
How long will it take to get to Tijuana?
About 2 hours.

592
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:42,891
Good Bye!
Bye!

593
01:14:56,140 --> 01:14:57,778
Johnny!

594
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:05,971
Johnny, over here! I bought you this.
In case you have walk home.

595
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:07,979
Thank you.

596
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:11,333
No.
I guessed you wore a 4 but...

597
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:14,333
I thought you'd be more comfortable in a
6.

598
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:18,095
Thanks Johnny.
Ok.

599
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:39,778
The gardenias are fresh.
Flowers!

600
01:15:44,780 --> 01:15:46,293
For the woman?

601
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:51,817
Thanks
They're for the misses.

602
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:58,015
The misses will put them in a book
and save them forever.

603
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:01,290
You should hold on to them
untill we reach the border.

604
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:04,857
She's also keeping the flowers?
We'll be there in 10 minutes.

605
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:06,619
10 minutes.

606
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:10,456
In 10 minutes we're going to lose a lot.

607
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:29,653
Where were you born?
Missouri.

608
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:32,096
And you?
Missouri.

609
01:16:43,740 --> 01:16:45,332
Anything to declare?
Not much.

610
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:47,815
A few things.
Leave your car here and take whatever...

611
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,295
you have to declare to the office.

612
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:01,256
How's your trip?
Pretty good.

613
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:03,571
Very nice.
Husband and wife?

614
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:06,010
Yes.
Then, there's just one form.

615
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:09,088
I'll fill it out.
Declare what you brought from Mexico.

616
01:17:09,420 --> 01:17:12,093
If you were there 24 hrs you
can spend up to 100 dollars each.

617
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:14,376
Then, sign here.

618
01:17:21,020 --> 01:17:24,615
Mrs. McClan, can we talk?
Of course.

619
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:27,056
This way, please.

620
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:41,858
You're under arrest.
What?

621
01:17:42,060 --> 01:17:44,051
You're under arrest.
I'm being arrested?

622
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:46,976
Yes.
No, you've made a mistake.

623
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,450
My name is Haley. The Los Angeles
police department has a...

624
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:52,260
file about me as well as
the narcotics department.

625
01:17:52,460 --> 01:17:54,052
I'm sure about this.

626
01:17:56,820 --> 01:17:58,378
I'm sorry.

627
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:02,454
I suggest you cooperate
with the authorities.

628
01:18:02,700 --> 01:18:05,260
It will be much easier for you.
You're suggesting that I cooperate?

629
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:08,134
The charges are possesion of
narcotics with the intent to contraband

630
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:10,052
You don't believe him, do you?
Of course I do.

631
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:12,051
He's a policeman.

632
01:18:16,860 --> 01:18:18,737
A policeman.

633
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:23,536
Are you a policeman?
I am, I work for customs.

634
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:32,498
Great, you've shown me your manliness
and shocked me with flowers.

635
01:18:33,180 --> 01:18:35,330
What a show! Do you have a badge?

636
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:39,649
Yes.
They whole time, you were going to

637
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:43,735
Well, you've certainly done it.
My work isn't always this easy.

638
01:18:44,300 --> 01:18:46,939
There are a few things harder
than playing the role of a stickler.

639
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:50,690
Keep talking. You're killing me.
Hello, Peterson.

640
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:52,938
You must be McEvoy.
I'm Whitaker.

641
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:54,295
How are you?

642
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:56,889
You don't care if
we use your office?

643
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:01,018
What happened to Gambin? Hi Haley.
Sir, I have to tell you something.

644
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:03,018
Tell me later.
Good, McEvoy.

645
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:06,775
Wait, sir. Do you know her?
Of course, she's...

646
01:19:07,460 --> 01:19:09,849
What are you doing here?
I'm under arrest.

647
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:13,930
For what?
Contrabanding drugs.

648
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:17,895
Would you like to explain this to me
miss?

649
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:20,854
But, what happened to Richard?
She knows all about Richard.

650
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:24,809
And how do you know that she knows?
I'm the one who found her and had her

651
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:28,097
Richard is looking for other
unk owing people for his Mexican

652
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:30,052
Wait a minute.
It's very simple.

653
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:33,929
I brought this man to the
border so that he could be arrested.

654
01:19:34,180 --> 01:19:37,616
That's not true. I brought her.
What do you mean?

655
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:41,460
Do you mean
you've been watching her?

656
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:44,893
Yes. She's one of Richard's girls.
I thought she'd give us in formation.

657
01:19:45,340 --> 01:19:48,855
And you were watching him?
Yeah, I didn't know who he was.

658
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:51,255
When I got to Mexico
for the Richard case, I found him.

659
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:54,936
Wait a minute.
Let me put this all in order.

660
01:19:56,100 --> 01:19:59,376
Who is this girl?
She's Madelaine Haley from

661
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:02,737
the Los Angeles police.
Imagine that.

662
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:09,018
This explains a lot.
Of course it does.

663
01:20:09,220 --> 01:20:12,690
You're a very smart agent.
Mr. Whatever your name is.

664
01:20:12,980 --> 01:20:15,778
Thank you. You're also very bright
Ms. Haley.

665
01:20:16,140 --> 01:20:17,937
Congratulations.
Thank you.

666
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:21,173
So, we've taken care of that.
What happened to Gambin?

667
01:20:21,780 --> 01:20:24,248
We have to get in touch with
his contact at the zoo tomorrow.

668
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:27,773
Mr. Whitaker, I'd like
for you to take me off the case.

669
01:20:28,020 --> 01:20:29,772
Don't be stupid.
Tomorrow, what time?

670
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:31,379
Noon.
And then what?

671
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:34,219
If it goes well, we can
get Gambin's strongest men.

672
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:36,695
This is great, McEvoy.
I'm going to leave the case, Mr.

673
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:40,973
Leave what? You're are the best
people for the job. Don't you think so,

674
01:20:41,780 --> 01:20:44,578
She has the equipment
and has no doubts about using it.

675
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:48,771
The two of you work well
together. Be at the zoo tomorrow.

676
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:52,692
You'll go together and keep
working as a team.

677
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:55,408
Yes, sir.
Mr. Whitaker, I just...

678
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:58,015
An order is an order.

679
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:09,178
What time is it?

680
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:16,729
What?
I asked if you knew what time it was.

681
01:21:17,620 --> 01:21:19,372
Yes sir.

682
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:25,812
1 minute to 12.
There aren't many people here today.

683
01:21:26,540 --> 01:21:30,215
On the weekends you can't...
They look hungry.

684
01:21:30,620 --> 01:21:35,740
They're always hungry. They eat like
horses. I give them horse meat.

685
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:41,050
This has been great...

686
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:05,856
Hello.

687
01:22:08,260 --> 01:22:12,776
You both look surprised.
You didn't expect to find me here, huh?

688
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:16,576
I expected to meet whoever it was going
to be.

689
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:19,255
Exactly.
I'll pay both of you.

690
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:23,055
I'm not worried, Harvey, now
I know you're on both sides.

691
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:26,616
Yes my friend. The Californian and
Mexican syndicates are mine.

692
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:30,419
Some day you'll learn, Johnny,
that you can't trust anyone.

693
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:32,457
I know.
I've already learned.

694
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:35,896
Did you get the goods through
the border ok?

695
01:22:36,060 --> 01:22:37,459
Yes.

696
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:44,136
They seem pretty innocent.
I've seen a lot like them at the border.

697
01:22:44,660 --> 01:22:49,211
Come to my house as soon as you can.
628 Gown Drive, end of the street.

698
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,497
Let's go.

699
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:30,168
Come in McClan
Sorry I couldn't get here earlier.

700
01:23:47,900 --> 01:23:49,936
This is McClan, boys.
Hello.

701
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:52,176
Hello.
Did you have any problems?

702
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:55,099
Yes.
Take out the rest of the goods, Buddy.

703
01:23:55,380 --> 01:23:56,938
All of it?
All of it.

704
01:23:57,180 --> 01:23:59,648
Tonight we'll meet
our contacts.

705
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:30,016
McEnvoy has 70 seconds to leave.
I hope he makes good use of them.

706
01:24:32,060 --> 01:24:35,416
You'll leave for Chicago in the morning.
They'll pick you up when you get there.

707
01:24:35,660 --> 01:24:37,651
OK.
Harvey, before you go on...

708
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:40,818
can you split it up later?
Give me my part and I'll go.

709
01:24:41,220 --> 01:24:43,176
I'll give it to you, Johnny.

710
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:46,695
Are you in a hurry?
No hurry.

711
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:49,570
You'll go to San Francisco.
What about Melvin?

712
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:52,738
I'm following the order of the list,
dummy.

713
01:24:54,620 --> 01:24:56,338
What do you want to drink, McClan?

714
01:24:56,940 --> 01:25:00,376
If we're going to be staying here
I'll eat something. Where's the kitchen?

715
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:02,532
There are sandwiches at the bar.

716
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:10,691
And what did you say about coffee?
I'll make you some in a second.

717
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:13,500
I'll do it?
The kitchen in on the other side.

718
01:25:17,140 --> 01:25:18,812
Does anyone want coffee?
NO.

719
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:24,577
Just a second.

720
01:25:24,980 --> 01:25:26,618
I'll get it.

721
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:30,376
The key is in my pocket.
Just a second.

722
01:25:37,740 --> 01:25:44,771
This is a raid!
You're all under arrest!

723
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:48,297
Come out the main door
with your hands in the air.

724
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:58,934
Do you hear me, Gambin, McClan,
Cliver, Harry, Larridge?

725
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:01,338
Give me a hand.

726
01:26:02,220 --> 01:26:05,178
They're not going to catch me with
evidence.

727
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:08,099
There's a box behind the bar.
We'll put it all in there.

728
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:12,616
Not even in your dreams, Gambin.
No one's hiding anything.

729
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:14,811
What are you doing?
I'm taking all this.

730
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:17,016
You're crazy.
I told you not to trust him.

731
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:19,091
They'll kill you
and all of us.

732
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:26,771
Get him over there!

733
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:30,419
Johnny!
It'll be better if you wait here.

734
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:34,176
Johnny!
Johnny!

735
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:37,735
Johnny!
Haley!

736
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:39,976
Yes, dear.

737
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:45,370
Are you ok, John? I guess so.
Where's Harvey?

738
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:54,372
Johnny, are you ok?
I've never felt better.

739
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:07,213
THE END.
