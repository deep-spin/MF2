00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,180
-Hey, Charlie.

902
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,760
-Barney!

903
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,690
You want to see something great?

904
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:17,660
Go on.

905
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,860
Ha, ha.

906
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:30,420
Oh!

907
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,760
-Pretty young to be hitting
 the bottle, isn't she?

908
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,120
It's the floor, darling.

909
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,040
Even Pavlova couldn't
 dance on a floor like this.

910
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,950
Are you all right?

911
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:40,860
-I'm sorry.

912
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:42,780
-Say something nice.

913
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,870
-It's swell kid, great.

914
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:47,160
The boss wants me on an
 interview at the Royal France.

915
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,970
I can't handle it,
 got a heavy date.

916
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:49,930
Cover for me, will you?

917
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:52,560
Uh, the woman's name
 is Lorraine Quarl.

918
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,430
-Who's Lorraine Quarl?

919
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:56,960
-Cafe society.

920
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:57,730
So long, kid.

921
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:59,600
You got a great act there.

922
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,630
Great!

923
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:04,420
All it needs is a finish.

924
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:05,410
-Oh, oh.

925
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:07,790
You've got the right finish,
 haven't you, sweetheart?

926
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:09,980
Right into my arms.

927
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:10,920
Ha, ha.

928
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,340
-Mr. Wills!

929
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:26,630
-Mrs Quarl!

930
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:28,980
I am Wills from the
 Europa News Service.

931
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:29,960
-I hate to be late.

932
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,880
I'm sorry.

933
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,810
And I need a drink.

934
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:37,010
Leon!

935
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,410
-The same, Mrs. Quarl?

936
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,870
-Please!

937
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,730
You can skip the usual.

938
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:42,670
Paris is beautiful.

939
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:44,910
American women love French men.

940
00:50:44,910 --> 00:50:47,060
French men love American women.

941
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:48,770
Prices are too high.

942
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:52,370
I haven't picked out
 my next husband yet.

943
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:55,040
Might be the bartender,
 at least he has talent.

944
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,910
-You've been interviewed before.

945
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:59,750
-The last time, an hour ago.

946
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:02,190
He wasn't very young
 or very attractive.

947
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:04,960
The interview was
 very, very short.

948
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,040
But then, take your time.

949
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:08,740
-Oh.

950
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:10,100
First trip to Paris?

951
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:10,850
Oh, no, no.

952
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:12,730
First divorce here, that's all.

953
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:14,420
-Why did you choose Paris?

954
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:17,410
-I get saddle sores
 in Reno, and I

955
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:19,160
lose too much
 money in Las Vegas.

956
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,160
-According to our files,
 you were married four times.

957
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:21,850
-Three.

958
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:23,130
Annulments don't count.

959
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:23,830
Leon!

960
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:26,790
-Is something wrong?

961
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:30,750
-Is something right?

962
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:34,210
-You-- you really can't tell one
 of my marriages from another.

963
00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:36,400
But that's the problem.

964
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:40,060
Husband number one, for love.

965
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:41,510
Failure.

966
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:43,530
Husband number two for money.

967
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:45,820
Failure, except for the
 money and the name Quarl.

968
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:46,780
-Ha!

969
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:49,260
LORRAINE: Husband
 number three, annulment.

970
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:51,980
He forgot to tell me
 he already had a wife.

971
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,280
Husband number
 four, a bullfighter.

972
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:59,010
Four times I bet,
 haven't had a hit.

973
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:01,810
-Any children involved?

974
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:02,730
-No.

975
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:04,790
And that's my only
 contribution to humanity.

976
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,530
I told you I was a failure.

977
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,720
Mm, shouldn't you be
 writing this down?

978
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,790
-Oh, the interview
 stopped long ago.

979
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:22,440
-Thank you.

980
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,140
I'm hungry.

981
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:24,630
What about dinner?

982
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:27,080
-Uh, I am not an
 expense account.

983
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,510
I'm just a struggling
 newspaper man.

984
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:30,250
-Oh, well, stop struggling.

985
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,350
The dinner is on
 my four husbands.

986
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:33,760
I'll change and
 I'll be right down.

987
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,490
-But what about the--

988
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:36,140
-Please, Mr. Wills.

989
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:40,330
At home my enemy charges $50
 an hour to listen to me talk.

[CHUCKLING]

991
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:01,700
-Hey!

992
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,690
That's my taxi!

993
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:04,630
-Charles!

994
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:05,330
-Hello, Claude!

995
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:06,030
I'm glad to see ya.

996
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:06,860
How have you been?

997
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:07,660
-Fine.

998
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:08,360
-You look fine.

999
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,660
How are ya, Marion?

1000
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:10,360
-Fine.

1001
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,360
-You look fine.

1002
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,010
I'm fine, too.

1003
00:53:14,010 --> 00:53:14,980
Ha, ha.

1004
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:16,010
Oh, excuse me.

1005
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:18,370
Uh, my sister-in-law, Mrs.
 Matine, Mr. Matine, Mrs. Quarl.

1006
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:19,070
-How do you do?

1007
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:25,880
-Uh, Claude's with the
 Prosecutor's Office.

1008
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:26,880
-Oh?

1009
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,370
I hope we haven't
 done anything wrong.

[CHUCKLING]

1011
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:36,110
-Uh, Mrs. Quarl just
 arrived in Paris.

1012
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:38,610
I'm, uh, interviewing her.

1013
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:39,860
-How's Helen?

1014
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:40,650
-Fine.

1015
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:41,110
Fine.

1016
00:53:41,110 --> 00:53:41,940
Oh, and you should Vicki.

1017
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:45,750
She's, you know, we really
 should see more of each other.

1018
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:47,560
After all family and--

1019
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,050
-I'll get in touch with
 Helen in the morning.

1020
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:51,970
Goodnight, Mrs. Quarl.

1021
00:53:51,970 --> 00:53:52,670
-Goodnight.

1022
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:53,370
-Goodnight.

1023
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:54,260
-Goodnight.

1024
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:56,660
-Charles, I really would
 like to see you again.

1025
00:53:56,660 --> 00:53:57,360
Goodnight.

1026
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,090
-Goodnight, Claude.

1027
00:53:58,090 --> 00:53:58,810
Thank you.

1028
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,560
-How is Helen?

1029
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:11,320
-Oh, now what's one little
 wife among all your husbands?

1030
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,670
-I'll imagine you'll catch
 it when you get home.

1031
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:14,700
-From Helen?

1032
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,020
Not Helen.

1033
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:21,540
She's the most wonderful,
 most understanding--

1034
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:24,520
do you mind if we don't
 go on with the interview?

1035
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,430
Somehow, I'm
 suddenly cold sober.

1036
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,270
And it's awfully late.

1037
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:31,210
And if I don't get back to
 the office and do this story--

1038
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:32,560
-Can I go with you?

1039
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,530
To the office, I mean.

1040
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:35,510
-Why?

1041
00:54:35,510 --> 00:54:36,940
-I don't know.

1042
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,590
We'll probably never
 see each other again,

1043
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:42,590
and I-- I'd like to drag
 the night out a little.

1044
00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:44,220
And I should see that story.

1045
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,780
-Oh, that office
 is awful cold and

1046
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,470
dingy at this hour
 of the morning.

1047
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:52,390
-You would be surprised how
 often I feel cold and dingy.

1048
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:53,370
I'll be simpatico.

1049
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:11,530
-Well, good morning.

1050
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:14,000
Now what's the matter?

1051
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,550
Oh, Charlie, how could you?

1052
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:19,540
Don't Charlie me, sister.

1053
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:21,490
What about you?

1054
00:55:21,490 --> 00:55:22,770
I'm sick and tired
 of you sitting

1055
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:25,700
around these crummy cafes
 day and night, the darling

1056
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,030
of every phony, petted by
 writers who don't write,

1057
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:31,250
adored by painters
 who don't paint.

1058
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:32,770
And what do you write?

1059
00:55:32,770 --> 00:55:35,930
Interviews with
 useless, sloppy women.

1060
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:37,720
Well, at least I don't
 jump into fountains

1061
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,190
and lap up all the
 liquor in Paris!

1062
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:42,500
Well, why don't you
 ask me why I drink,

1063
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,120
why I jump in the fountains?

1064
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,540
That's right, blame me.

1065
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:48,320
Blame me.

1066
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,080
Did I want to stay in Paris?

1067
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,800
What right have you
 to criticize me?

1068
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,060
You're suspicious?

1069
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:55,830
You?

1070
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:56,660
Ah!

1071
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:57,580
That's a laugh!

1072
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:59,060
Now you just listen to me!

1073
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,580
-Morning, darling.

1074
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:14,080
-Helen.

1075
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:21,840
Do you realize what time it is?

1076
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,300
-Mm.

1077
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:26,120
Mm, does it matter, darling?

1078
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,700
-It's 8 o'clock in the morning!

1079
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:31,180
-Mm, it's your turn to
 take Vicki to school.

1080
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:37,690

01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:55,220
Very honest.

1788
01:40:57,970 --> 01:40:58,900
-Thanks.

1789
01:40:58,900 --> 01:40:59,600
-Yeah.

1790
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:00,770
I liked it.

1791
01:41:00,770 --> 01:41:01,790
I liked it, fine.

1792
01:41:06,550 --> 01:41:07,500
-Uh, here.

1793
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:09,260
For you, Havana cigars.

1794
01:41:12,870 --> 01:41:15,450
The kind you like.

1795
01:41:15,450 --> 01:41:16,830
Shall I open them for you?

1796
01:41:16,830 --> 01:41:19,040
-Oh, later.

1797
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:23,470
Uh, doctor says when
 I'm better, huh?

1798
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:33,190
-Where's Vicki?

1799
01:41:33,190 --> 01:41:35,920
You've come for her?

1800
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:39,190
-If I can get her back again.

1801
01:41:39,190 --> 01:41:40,160
-Good.

1802
01:41:40,160 --> 01:41:41,910
Good.

-Daddy.

-What?

1810
01:42:03,730 --> 01:42:05,590
-You're not grey.

1811
01:42:05,590 --> 01:42:09,210
I told everybody at
 school you'd be grey.

1812
01:42:09,210 --> 01:42:10,640
-Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

1813
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:16,390
Oh, here.

Welcome, Charles.

1817
01:42:24,750 --> 01:42:27,180
I'm very happy to see you.

1818
01:42:27,180 --> 01:42:28,470
-Thanks.

1819
01:42:28,470 --> 01:42:30,230
For everything, thanks.

1820
01:42:30,230 --> 01:42:34,640
-As soon as I got your telephone
 message, I went to school

1821
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:36,620
and got Vicki.

1822
01:42:36,620 --> 01:42:37,610
VICKI: Look, Daddy!

1823
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:40,090
Look!

-Uh-oh!

It's wonderful, as usual.

01:42:50,910 --> 01:42:51,610
-Daddy!

-What?

1830
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:54,110
-Could we go to de Beaune?

1831
01:42:54,110 --> 01:42:56,700
Remember the rainbow train?

01:42:56,700 --> 01:42:57,590
-Well, I--

-Oh, please?

1834
01:42:59,180 --> 01:42:59,880
Please?

1835
01:42:59,880 --> 01:43:03,240
That was the very first thing
 I wanted to do when you came.

1836
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:09,420
-You've got about an hour
 till Marion comes back.

1837
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:10,800
-I'll wear my new coat.

1838
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:11,500
-OK.

1839
01:43:15,290 --> 01:43:17,090
How is Marion?

1840
01:43:17,090 --> 01:43:17,830
-She's fine.

1841
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:22,490
-I want to know, Claude,
 how much I appreciate--

1842
01:43:22,490 --> 01:43:25,080
-Oh, I didn't do anything.

1843
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:27,600
I showed Marion your letter.

1844
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:30,830
She couldn't stop you
 from seeing Vicki.

1845
01:43:30,830 --> 01:43:34,470
-I was hoping she would
 let me have Vicki back.

1846
01:43:34,470 --> 01:43:37,310
I've got to have her, Claude.

1847
01:43:37,310 --> 01:43:38,900
I need her.

1848
01:43:38,900 --> 01:43:42,900
-Yes, I think she
 needs you, too.

1849
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:43,600

Hurry, Daddy!

The hour is almost is almost up.

1853
01:43:47,690 --> 01:43:48,450
-I bought your book.

1854
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:57,400
And about Marion, if we are
 careful, if may be all right.

1855

Why?

1860

-You didn't even look at me.

1861
01:44:49,290 --> 01:44:50,250
You didn't even wave at me.

1862
01:44:50,250 --> 01:44:51,060
-Oh, ho.

1863
01:44:51,060 --> 01:44:53,110
Will you give me another chance?

1864
01:44:53,110 --> 01:44:54,350
You get back on that
 train and I'll--

1865
01:44:54,350 --> 01:44:58,260
-Daddy, may I sit
 out the next ride?

1866
01:44:58,260 --> 01:44:58,960
-Oh.

 old for that sort of thing.

-Ha, ha.

-Don't you think so?

-I have a picture
 of her in my room.

Very much like her.

 in at the Dingo bar

this afternoon, just
 to see how it looked.

 had enough of bars.

 one drink every afternoon,

but no more.

01:48:43,380 --> 01:48:45,800
And I take that
 drink deliberately.

 a drink won't get too big.

 don't take the drink.

 have that-- well,

Helen, soaked and--

 remember one night.

How long are you gonna make
 me pay for that one night?

1972
01:51:02,660 --> 01:51:05,440
What about those years Helen
 and I loved each other?

1973
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:08,090
-I don't want to hear about it!

-Marion, you're not
 gonna let me have Vicki?

-No.

 talking about it.

1986

He's not getting Vicki.

-Why?

1989

Do you hate him that much?

-Yes.

1991
01:52:26,190 --> 01:52:29,250
For what he did, yes!

1992
01:52:29,250 --> 01:52:30,530
-Yes.

1993
01:52:30,530 --> 01:52:32,330
It's true.

1994
01:52:32,330 --> 01:52:38,180
He committed an unforgivable
 crime, against you, personally.

1995
01:52:38,180 --> 01:52:41,190
He's guilty of never
 knowing you loved him.

1996
01:52:41,190 --> 01:52:44,090
You found him, but
 he married Helen.

1997
01:52:44,090 --> 01:52:47,250
And yes, he's
 guilty of that, too.

1998
01:52:47,250 --> 01:52:50,910
And being guilty, of
 course, he must be punished.

1999
01:52:50,910 --> 01:52:52,640
The penalty?

2000
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:55,460
What would hurt him most.

 most, his little girl.

I wanted all your love.

2005
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:22,780
I wanted our own child.

2006

 out of your disappointment.
