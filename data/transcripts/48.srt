1
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:15,105
Ellen.

2
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:18,207
Yes, Miss Fiske.
- Is there any mail for me?

3
00:02:18,783 --> 00:02:20,449
No, just this one letter.

4
00:02:22,257 --> 00:02:24,580
No sign of Bates yet?
- Not yet.

5
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:27,122
Oh dear, I do hope you
won't miss your train.

6
00:02:28,288 --> 00:02:29,130
I mustn't.

7
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:34,632
Oh Lucy, hurry with that bag.
- Just coming, Miss.

8
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:40,533
Ellen.

9
00:02:40,937 --> 00:02:42,986
That business I want you
to see about in London.

10
00:02:43,703 --> 00:02:45,281
This is for Mr Scott at the bank.

11
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:47,797
It's about those Brazilian
bonds of mine.

12
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:50,463
The way the market is this week,
I think they ought to be ..

13
00:02:51,108 --> 00:02:53,011
Get outside.
Keep your eyes open for Bates.

14
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:54,154
Yes, Miss.

15
00:02:57,364 --> 00:02:59,365
And this address is
just off Berkeley Square.

16
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:02,745
Go to the servant's entrance and
ask for Mr Blake. He's the butler.

17
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:06,248
Say you've come from me with
a message for Lord Cardington.

18
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:08,999
And will he give it to his
Lordship .. privately.

19
00:03:10,145 --> 00:03:11,726
Ellen, you aren't paying attention.

20
00:03:12,861 --> 00:03:14,130
But I am, Miss Fiske.

21
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:16,862
What would be the best time to call?

22
00:03:18,183 --> 00:03:20,515
Harry always used to dine around eight.

23
00:03:21,648 --> 00:03:23,869
You call about half past seven.
- Yes, very well.

24
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:25,441
You seem upset.

25
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:27,082
Bad news?

26
00:03:28,607 --> 00:03:30,395
I don't want to bother
you with my troubles.

27
00:03:31,555 --> 00:03:33,845
It isn't a question of bothering
me with your troubles.

28
00:03:34,385 --> 00:03:36,059
You've become almost like my daughter.

29
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,033
The letter is from my sisters,
Emily and Louisa.

30
00:03:40,723 --> 00:03:42,666
They're very unhappy back
in London without me.

31
00:03:43,371 --> 00:03:46,159
After all, I only saw them once since
I came to work for you, Miss Fiske.

32
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:50,075
You'll see them today, won't you?
And everything will be alright, surely.

33
00:03:50,516 --> 00:03:51,365
Miss Fiske.

34
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,239
Bates is coming.

35
00:03:53,677 --> 00:03:54,941
Tell him to hurry himself.

36
00:03:56,902 --> 00:04:00,083
My kind regards to your sisters, Ellen.
- Thank you, Miss Fiske.

37
00:04:05,516 --> 00:04:07,945
I've written them so much about you.

38
00:04:08,818 --> 00:04:10,041
How kind you've been.

39
00:04:10,952 --> 00:04:13,704
Stuff and nonsense.
I'm fond of you. You shouldn't ..

40
00:04:14,411 --> 00:04:16,314
Oh, a lovely juicy one.

41
00:04:18,629 --> 00:04:21,722
Perhaps you'll .. you might allow
them down for a little visit one day?

42
00:04:22,338 --> 00:04:24,174
Oh dear, look what the damp has done.

43
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:27,291
Certainly, yes.
By all means. At any time.

44
00:04:27,661 --> 00:04:30,625
You know Lucy polished this
table all yesterday afternoon.

45
00:04:31,859 --> 00:04:34,142
Miss Fiske.
- Yes?

46
00:04:34,903 --> 00:04:36,139
It occurred to me that ..

47
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:40,310
Since they've been so wretched lately,
and you may allow them to visit one day.

48
00:04:40,526 --> 00:04:42,677
Oh that? Yes, indeed. You tell them.

49
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:45,776
Perhaps in the spring when
it's warm and sunny.

50
00:04:58,452 --> 00:05:01,788
Well .. what I was going to ask was ..

51
00:05:03,656 --> 00:05:06,019
Might I bring them back
with me this time? Now?

52
00:05:06,313 --> 00:05:08,044
Well now, Ellen.
- They won't be a bother.

53
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,100
I promise Miss Fiske .. and it
will mean so much to them.

54
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,056
Very well my dear. You bring with
you by all means. For a day or two.

55
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:18,974
Thank you, Miss Fiske.

56
00:05:19,913 --> 00:05:22,776
I can't tell you how grateful I am.
- Well don't try, my dear.

57
00:05:23,612 --> 00:05:26,540
He's here, Miss.
- About time. The good-for-nothing.

58
00:05:29,731 --> 00:05:31,919
Ellen, have you got everything?
- Yes, Miss Fiske.

59
00:05:36,257 --> 00:05:37,214
Morning, ma'am.

60
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,040
Bates, you might have been more prompt.
What on earth made you so late?

61
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:44,233
Her. You can't gallop over the roads
with a lady in her delicate condition.

62
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:46,985
She's going to throw a calf, she be.

63
00:05:47,329 --> 00:05:49,142
I'm taking her to the vets, I am.

64
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,795
Kindly let her not throw any calves
until you get Miss Ellen to the station.

65
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:58,324
Calves don't come by timetable, lady.
- Well trains do.

66
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:02,789
Yes, ma'am.
- Goodbye, Miss Fiske.

67
00:06:03,093 --> 00:06:05,919
Goodbye, Miss Ellen.
- Goodbye, Lucy.

68
00:06:08,225 --> 00:06:10,399
Don't forget the allowance
from you-know-who.

69
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,943
No, I shan't.

70
00:06:12,751 --> 00:06:13,558
Goodbye.

71
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:15,295
Lucy.
- Yes, Miss.

72
00:06:16,549 --> 00:06:18,440
Alright now, there is a
day's work to be done.

73
00:06:43,285 --> 00:06:46,731
La, la, la .. la, la, la.

74
00:06:47,792 --> 00:06:51,445
This is nice. It's very, very nice.
- What's that you have there, Miss?

75
00:06:52,224 --> 00:06:55,022
It's called the New Comic Opera.
It's all the rage in London.

76
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:56,355
The Mi-Ka-Do.

77
00:06:57,272 --> 00:06:58,355
Mikado.

78
00:06:59,483 --> 00:07:02,512
I used to tour the provinces with
the gentleman who sent it to me.

79
00:07:02,932 --> 00:07:05,701
Look, he signed it for me:
'Rutland Barington'.

80
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,844
'For my adored Leonora
with fond memories of ..'

81
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:14,032
Never mind about that.
Go and do the dishes.

82
00:07:14,248 --> 00:07:15,034
Yes, Miss.

83
00:07:18,969 --> 00:07:23,159
<i>On a tree by a willow, a little tom-tit</i>.

84
00:07:23,685 --> 00:07:27,337
<i>Sang: willow, tit-willow, tit-willow</i>.

85
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,012
<i>And I said to him: dicky-bird,
why do you sit?</i>

86
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,024
<i>Singing: willow, tit-willow, tit-willow</i>.

87
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:41,550
Go on. Don't stop.

88
00:07:41,803 --> 00:07:45,343
Who are you? What are you doing here?
- Listening .. very nice too.

89
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:48,810
What do you want?
- Ask me in and I'll tell you.

90
00:07:52,312 --> 00:07:55,617
Anyway young man, you may
come in .. but mind your manners.

91
00:07:56,854 --> 00:07:57,794
Alright, Miss.

92
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,470
Isn't this where Miss Ellen Creed lives?
- Yes, she lives here.

93
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:12,146
What do you wish to see her about?
- It's a personal matter.

94
00:08:13,315 --> 00:08:15,156
She's my aunt. I'm Albert Feather.

95
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:17,189
Your aunt?
- Right.

96
00:08:17,842 --> 00:08:20,039
Her mother was my stepfather's
uncle's second wife.

97
00:08:22,067 --> 00:08:24,058
And where do you come from?
- Gravesend.

98
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:26,422
I .. I work in a bank there.

99
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,891
It's a very long walk.
Hadn't you better sit down?

100
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:30,640
Thank you.

101
00:08:33,063 --> 00:08:34,628
I'm afraid it's all been for nothing.

102
00:08:34,844 --> 00:08:37,420
Your aunt Ellen has gone to
London on some business for me.

103
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:39,462
How long will she be away?

104
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,215
A few days.
- A few?

105
00:08:43,071 --> 00:08:44,665
Blimey. That will be too late.

106
00:08:45,843 --> 00:08:47,270
Is there anything I can do?

107
00:08:47,764 --> 00:08:51,327
I'm Miss Fiske. Your aunt has been
working here as a housekeeper/companion.

108
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:54,325
I didn't know.
I haven't seen her for five years.

109
00:08:56,066 --> 00:08:57,102
Can I help?

110
00:08:59,294 --> 00:09:00,176
I wonder.

111
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,642
What's the trouble?

112
00:09:02,394 --> 00:09:03,435
Or is it trouble?

113
00:09:04,397 --> 00:09:07,440
It's trouble right enough.
I hardly like to tell you.

114
00:09:08,163 --> 00:09:09,437
Oh, I see.

115
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,115
What's the amount?

116
00:09:12,388 --> 00:09:14,291
Twelve pounds.
- How much?

117
00:09:14,952 --> 00:09:17,446
Twelve pounds.
- My goodness. That's a lot of money.

118
00:09:17,662 --> 00:09:19,564
I know. What's worse,
I must have it by tonight.

119
00:09:19,937 --> 00:09:21,177
I'm short at the bank.

120
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:24,425
It means jail if I can't put it back
before the cashier checks up.

121
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:27,092
Gambling?
- No. A girl.

122
00:09:28,525 --> 00:09:29,814
Are you engaged to her?

123
00:09:30,198 --> 00:09:31,426
No. She's an actress.

124
00:09:32,294 --> 00:09:34,143
She was in a travelling
company in Gravesend.

125
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,933
What? At the Old Grand?

126
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,551
You know it?
- I played there.

127
00:09:40,084 --> 00:09:41,113
Years ago.

128
00:09:41,968 --> 00:09:43,041
You were an actress?

129
00:09:43,648 --> 00:09:45,054
Front row of the chorus.

130
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:47,868
Fourth from the right.

131
00:09:48,396 --> 00:09:49,710
She was in the chorus too.

132
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:51,820
I expect you took her out to supper.

133
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,542
Then she persuaded you to
go round the shops with her.

134
00:09:55,486 --> 00:09:56,610
How did you know?

135
00:09:58,034 --> 00:09:59,272
'Imagination', my boy.

136
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,427
Anyway, she's over the hills
now to some other town.

137
00:10:03,731 --> 00:10:05,583
And with some other fool.
The little cheat.

138
00:10:10,573 --> 00:10:13,436
Don't worry any more about it.
I'll give you the twelve pounds.

139
00:10:14,686 --> 00:10:15,719
You will?

140
00:10:16,204 --> 00:10:19,080
Perhaps I owe it to you .. in a sense.

141
00:10:20,452 --> 00:10:21,783
Or to some other fool.

142
00:10:22,564 --> 00:10:23,754
You're a life-saver.

143
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:26,940
Now you just wait here. I'll just
run upstairs and get my keys.

144
00:10:31,814 --> 00:10:33,378
A pity there aren't more like you.

145
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,850
That my, lad, is a matter of opinion.

146
00:10:38,268 --> 00:10:40,807
Do you mind if I tickle on your ivories?
- No, do.

147
00:10:41,403 --> 00:10:42,190
Thank you.

148
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,944
<i>It's the same the whole world over</i>.

149
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:53,102
<i>It's</i> ..

150
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:03,183
<i>It's the poor what gets the blame</i>.

151
00:11:04,394 --> 00:11:08,374
<i>While the rich has all the pleasures</i>.

152
00:11:09,117 --> 00:11:12,780
<i>Now, ain't that the blinking shame</i>.

153
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:20,183
Hello.

154
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,996
You did scare me.

155
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,167
I thought I was hearing things.

156
00:11:24,565 --> 00:11:25,460
You were.

157
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:26,681
But I mean.

158
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:28,245
A man's voice.

159
00:11:29,023 --> 00:11:30,360
So funny here.

160
00:11:32,142 --> 00:11:34,993
Doesn't the tide wash up
many male fish, my angel?

161
00:11:35,476 --> 00:11:38,023
A man is as scarce as
hansom cabs in these parts.

162
00:11:38,377 --> 00:11:40,049
That is, all but the old ones.

163
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:43,699
The young ones go off to London or
some foreign parts as soon as they can.

164
00:11:44,405 --> 00:11:45,990
Are you going off to foreign parts?

165
00:11:46,537 --> 00:11:48,929
It depends.
- Depends on what?

166
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,342
If anyone ever asks me.

167
00:11:52,252 --> 00:11:54,778
I shouldn't think with eyes like them
there would be any difficulty.

168
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,438
Go on.

169
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,288
What's your name?
- Lucy.

170
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:02,390
What's yours?
- Albert. I'm Miss Creel's nephew.

171
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:05,195
Funny .. I never heard about you.

172
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,223
That must be remedied.

173
00:12:09,483 --> 00:12:12,253
How about making the most of a male
fish now one has been washed up, eh?

174
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,043
What about a smacker?
- No, you mustn't.

175
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:17,175
I don't know you.

176
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,993
You needn't know people to kiss them.
- I do.

177
00:12:21,065 --> 00:12:22,481
Alright my girl. It's your loss.

178
00:12:23,722 --> 00:12:25,495
You think a lot of yourself, don't you?

179
00:12:36,494 --> 00:12:39,581
Has Lucy been entertaining you, Albert?
- Eh?

180
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:42,777
She came in. We had a word or two.

181
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:46,728
Nice looker, isn't she?
- I didn't notice.

182
00:12:47,252 --> 00:12:50,496
Come now, Albert.
Don't lose your sense of humour.

183
00:12:50,712 --> 00:12:53,147
I hope you're not one of those who
won't benefit from experience.

184
00:12:53,446 --> 00:12:57,232
Otherwise my twelve pounds
will be rather wasted, won't it.

185
00:12:58,006 --> 00:12:59,937
Don't you worry Miss Fiske.
I've had my lesson.

186
00:13:00,307 --> 00:13:01,631
I hope so.

187
00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:07,912
Now .. this is where we
keep our little hoard.

188
00:13:09,396 --> 00:13:11,055
It's an old bake-oven really.

189
00:13:12,795 --> 00:13:14,007
A proper tomb, isn't it?

190
00:13:15,288 --> 00:13:16,161
What's that?

191
00:13:16,603 --> 00:13:18,678
This is what they used to
pull the loaves out with.

192
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,941
Of course, we don't use it as a
bake-oven. Hasn't been used in years.

193
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:31,880
Now then.

194
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,726
Twelve pounds, I think you said.

195
00:13:35,604 --> 00:13:37,505
You couldn't make if fifteen?
- No, I couldn't.

196
00:13:37,721 --> 00:13:38,593
You couldn't?

197
00:13:40,918 --> 00:13:42,648
Do I give you an I.O.U.?

198
00:13:43,001 --> 00:13:44,040
No thank you.

199
00:13:44,453 --> 00:13:45,721
This isn't a loan.

200
00:13:46,087 --> 00:13:49,548
I shouldn't like you to incur the
remorse of not paying it back.

201
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:51,267
You are a daisy.

202
00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:55,680
Very prettily done, Albert.

203
00:14:00,308 --> 00:14:02,327
Now, let's forget all about it.

204
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,870
If you came next week, you'd have
found three of your aunts here.

205
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:09,049
Ellen is bringing her
sisters back from London.

206
00:14:09,406 --> 00:14:11,513
What, the potty ones?
- Potty?

207
00:14:11,729 --> 00:14:13,188
Queer as mice in a cage.

208
00:14:14,466 --> 00:14:16,775
They're quite harmless.
Especially when aunt Ellen's around.

209
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:20,141
For comfort, they're coming
to stay here for a few days.

210
00:14:20,646 --> 00:14:23,031
They seem to mean quite a
great deal to your aunt Ellen.

211
00:14:23,247 --> 00:14:24,573
Oh, they would.

212
00:14:25,219 --> 00:14:27,164
She's looked after them
since she was a kid.

213
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:30,676
She's watched over them like they were
a couple of perishing babes-in-arms.

214
00:14:31,397 --> 00:14:34,292
I think that's very commendable of her.
- Perhaps, but ..

215
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:36,355
Think of all the fun she's missing.

216
00:14:37,398 --> 00:14:40,282
What, for example?
- You know.

217
00:14:41,511 --> 00:14:42,582
I see.

218
00:14:43,201 --> 00:14:46,094
I have to be toddling along.
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

219
00:14:51,506 --> 00:14:54,128
I'd appreciate if you don't mention
our little transaction to aunt Ellen.

220
00:14:54,344 --> 00:14:55,709
Very well. If you like.

221
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:57,446
How about .. whatsername?

222
00:14:57,987 --> 00:15:00,717
Lucy? Oh she won't say anything.
I'll take care of that.

223
00:15:01,147 --> 00:15:01,848
Thanks.

224
00:15:04,128 --> 00:15:05,104
So long my lady.

225
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,428
And again from the heart. I'll never
forget your kindness as long as I live.

226
00:15:10,954 --> 00:15:12,887
I hope you live a great
deal longer than that.

227
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,882
Isn't it funny, Ellen? You can't see
the wind and you can't touch it.

228
00:15:46,164 --> 00:15:47,202
But it's there.

229
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,549
I think you'd better have this round
you, dear. It's getting quite chilly.

230
00:15:52,323 --> 00:15:54,061
Listen .. what's that?

231
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:56,455
Those are The Priory bells, dear.
From over the marshes.

232
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,875
Oh .. I shan't like that.

233
00:16:00,388 --> 00:16:03,269
She hates bells.
- Especially church bells.

234
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,415
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong.

235
00:16:06,823 --> 00:16:08,452
Aren't the marshes pretty.

236
00:16:09,396 --> 00:16:11,378
The grass is too long and untidy.

237
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,566
If I had a knife and a bit of string,
I'd cut it and tie it up in bundles.

238
00:16:18,823 --> 00:16:21,809
Are there any sheep here on the marshes?
- Yes, Miss.

239
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:25,040
I think sheep are so clever to
chew their cud the way they do.

240
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,918
It's very difficult.

241
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,030
I've tried.

242
00:16:31,415 --> 00:16:34,749
You ought to be a sailor, Miss.
They're always chewing tobacco.

243
00:16:35,584 --> 00:16:37,415
The man I was to marry was a sailor.

244
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:39,482
He gave me this.

245
00:16:40,242 --> 00:16:42,105
It's all I have to remember him by.

246
00:16:43,219 --> 00:16:44,631
He was wrecked at sea.

247
00:16:46,036 --> 00:16:47,692
They were all drowned.

248
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:50,781
It must have been a bit of
sadness for you, Missy.

249
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,617
Oh no. I've quite forgotten
what he looked like.

250
00:16:53,867 --> 00:16:58,114
I saw a drowned man once. They took
him out of the Thames. He was green.

251
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:00,800
Frogs.

252
00:17:01,614 --> 00:17:03,598
There must be lots of frogs.

253
00:17:04,872 --> 00:17:07,194
We used to have such
fun with them at home.

254
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:11,767
We used to put them on the dining-table
and make them jump in the marmalade pot.

255
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:27,124
Look. There's a bird's nest.
- So there is.

256
00:17:27,425 --> 00:17:29,585
It must be last summer's.
- I should like to have that.

257
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:30,956
Bates, stop please.

258
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:35,709
Oh .. I have it.

259
00:17:37,576 --> 00:17:40,244
Isn't it beautiful?
- Oh dear, it's all cobwebby.

260
00:17:41,088 --> 00:17:43,437
And it has a horrid smell.
- It mustn't be wasted.

261
00:17:43,773 --> 00:17:46,676
I shall save it until next year
and then I'll put it back again.

262
00:17:47,792 --> 00:17:49,568
Who knows where we'll be next year?

263
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:53,493
Not in London anyway. You promised that.

264
00:17:54,646 --> 00:17:56,807
Yes, I promised that.
- Look.

265
00:17:59,651 --> 00:18:02,019
Louisa .. how did that happen?

266
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,334
She did it.
- Who?

267
00:18:03,721 --> 00:18:04,985
That woman in London.

268
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,599
She didn't give us enough food either.
- 'Discipline' she said.

269
00:18:09,276 --> 00:18:11,196
Louisa used to cry all night.

270
00:18:11,605 --> 00:18:13,863
I didn't. She couldn't discipline me.

271
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,371
We'll be alright here
though with Miss Fiske.

272
00:18:17,911 --> 00:18:18,927
She won't beat us.

273
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:22,086
No darling, she won't beat you.

274
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:24,774
No-one will again. Ever.

275
00:18:35,203 --> 00:18:38,132
Now remember what I told you both.
You're not to talk too much.

276
00:18:38,505 --> 00:18:40,175
Wait until Miss Fiske knows you better.

277
00:18:40,391 --> 00:18:42,433
How can she get to know
us better if we don't talk?

278
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,955
Come along dear.
Bates, get the luggage, will you.

279
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:47,147
Yes, ma'am.

280
00:18:55,788 --> 00:18:57,441
They look harmless.
- What, Miss?

281
00:18:58,044 --> 00:19:00,065
Never mind. Go and put the kettle on.
- Yes, Miss.

282
00:19:07,201 --> 00:19:09,332
Well, here we are.
- I'm glad.

283
00:19:09,821 --> 00:19:12,750
Miss Fiske .. my sister
Emily, my sister Louisa.

284
00:19:13,012 --> 00:19:15,614
How do you do, Emily?
- We're very glad to be here.

285
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:18,625
Louisa.
- I don't like people to touch me.

286
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:22,203
I'm afraid Miss Fiske will
think you're very rude.

287
00:19:22,637 --> 00:19:25,893
They're rather tired, poor dears.
- I never get tired.

288
00:19:26,246 --> 00:19:28,424
I sometimes walk about
the house all night.

289
00:19:29,354 --> 00:19:32,358
Do you indeed?
- No, of course she doesn't, Miss Fiske.

290
00:19:35,582 --> 00:19:37,090
What beautiful furniture.

291
00:19:37,766 --> 00:19:40,401
Just like we used to have
before we lost all our money.

292
00:19:40,705 --> 00:19:44,104
Some of these <i>are </i>our things, dear.
Miss Fiske bought them at my Curio Shop.

293
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:45,716
I want my tea.

294
00:19:45,982 --> 00:19:49,687
Emily, see .. here's the
grand champ himself.

295
00:19:50,198 --> 00:19:52,303
Remember when father bought him for us?

296
00:19:52,874 --> 00:19:54,913
I wonder if his head still nods.

297
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,850
Ding-dong, ding-dong ..
- Louisa, dear.

298
00:19:58,188 --> 00:20:00,094
Bates, be careful.
You'll scratch the furniture.

299
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:01,719
Very good, ma'am.

300
00:20:07,149 --> 00:20:09,201
I must say you've brought
enough luggage with you.

301
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:11,220
We've brought everything.
- Everything?

302
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,760
We had to.
- Why?

303
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:14,453
When they sent for the police.

304
00:20:14,787 --> 00:20:17,483
Now, my dears. I'm sure all this
can't possibly interest Miss Fiske.

305
00:20:17,819 --> 00:20:19,779
I think we should go up
and rest a bit before tea.

306
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,023
Whatever you say, Ellen.
- Come along, Emily.

307
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:24,948
That smelly train was very dirty.

308
00:20:25,188 --> 00:20:28,708
She's always fussing about the dirt.
I hope you keep things tidy here.

309
00:20:28,924 --> 00:20:32,483
Cleanliness is next to
Godliness .. don't you agree?

310
00:20:33,018 --> 00:20:35,985
Well .. I'm quite clean, I believe.

311
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,005
But I don't know that
I'm particularly Godly.

312
00:20:39,668 --> 00:20:41,267
I thought you were a Roman.

313
00:20:41,837 --> 00:20:42,824
Isn't that yours?

314
00:20:43,077 --> 00:20:45,458
Miss Fiske is a Roman, dear.
And a very devoted one.

315
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:47,614
Come along Louisa, Emily.

316
00:20:47,957 --> 00:20:50,102
Father, didn't approve of Romans.

317
00:20:52,032 --> 00:20:53,290
And neither do I.

318
00:21:13,724 --> 00:21:16,116
I expect it's one of those boobies.

319
00:21:16,588 --> 00:21:20,641
Miss Emily was drawing cat's faces on
brown paper yesterday when you were out.

320
00:21:21,138 --> 00:21:23,357
I can't stand it. I can't stand it.

321
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:26,634
My lovely paisley shawl. It's ruined.

322
00:21:27,927 --> 00:21:31,189
You'd better get some vinegar and see
if you can do something about this spot.

323
00:21:31,443 --> 00:21:32,256
Yes, Miss.

324
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,900
I'm utterly exhausted clearing
up after their messes.

325
00:21:36,172 --> 00:21:38,204
I don't wonder, Miss. So am I.

326
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:42,030
And you should see their
bedroom. It's like a goat's-pen.

327
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:45,783
I know it. If it isn't one
thing, it's another.

328
00:21:46,153 --> 00:21:49,633
For the last six weeks were like living
in the middle of Piccadilly Circus.

329
00:21:50,566 --> 00:21:52,478
My heart won't stand it.

330
00:21:53,336 --> 00:21:55,144
Go and get my smelling salts.

331
00:21:56,829 --> 00:21:59,720
Where are they, Miss?
- In the usual place, of course.

332
00:21:59,984 --> 00:22:01,928
Nothing is in the usual
place these days.

333
00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:02,822
No.

334
00:22:03,664 --> 00:22:05,532
Well then, get me a cold compress.

335
00:22:06,303 --> 00:22:09,597
I shall lie down and
take a nap while I can.

336
00:22:13,641 --> 00:22:14,627
Miss Fiske.

337
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,862
Yes, what is it? What is it?
- Will they be staying much longer?

338
00:22:20,743 --> 00:22:23,049
They'll have my invitation
to go this evening.

339
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,273
Oh dear, I wonder where Emily has
gone to. She ought to be back by now.

340
00:22:31,513 --> 00:22:33,331
I can't see her anywhere.

341
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:37,997
I wish I were brave like Emily.
I should like to take long walks too.

342
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:40,016
And pick up things.

343
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,248
Perhaps I shall be able to
after we've stayed here longer.

344
00:22:44,902 --> 00:22:46,145
I'm sure you will, dear.

345
00:22:46,442 --> 00:22:48,530
I shall be staying here, shan't I?

346
00:22:49,544 --> 00:22:52,354
You're not planning to send us away?
Are you, Ellen?

347
00:22:53,227 --> 00:22:54,739
No dear. Of course I'm not.

348
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:57,189
This is what you've always promised us.

349
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,885
A little place in the country
where we can always be safe.

350
00:23:01,424 --> 00:23:04,604
Yes .. it's the one thing
I've been working for.

351
00:23:05,415 --> 00:23:07,236
Ever since we had to
give up the old house.

352
00:23:07,574 --> 00:23:10,567
Naturally, Estuary House
could never be like that.

353
00:23:11,114 --> 00:23:12,511
But it's nice enough.

354
00:23:12,898 --> 00:23:14,774
Yes, and Miss Fiske has
been very kind to us.

355
00:23:15,471 --> 00:23:18,924
Miss Fiske .. may I tell
you something, Ellen?

356
00:23:19,743 --> 00:23:21,102
Just one of my secrets.

357
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:22,931
Of course you may.

358
00:23:23,717 --> 00:23:25,589
I don't like Miss Fiske.

359
00:23:27,025 --> 00:23:30,951
Couldn't we send her away? Then it
would <i>really</i> be just the three of us.

360
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,656
But I keep telling you,
Louisa. It's <i>her</i> house.

361
00:23:34,059 --> 00:23:36,189
Oh no. You'll never
make me believe that.

362
00:23:36,987 --> 00:23:38,457
All out lovely things are there.

363
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:43,336
We'll never have to go away, will we?
- No, darling. I promised you.

364
00:23:44,163 --> 00:23:44,998
Never.

365
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,323
I think Miss Fiske wants us to go.

366
00:23:49,091 --> 00:23:50,341
Both of us.

367
00:23:50,928 --> 00:23:52,812
I'm sure I can persuade
her to let you stay.

368
00:23:54,613 --> 00:23:56,349
Oh dear, I do wish Emily would come.

369
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:58,912
Maybe we'd better get along
home in case she's waiting there.

370
00:23:59,701 --> 00:24:00,838
Come along, dear.

371
00:24:01,945 --> 00:24:04,810
I don't want her upsetting Miss Fiske
again. She can be very tactless.

372
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:25,220
Here girl, take this.

373
00:24:25,436 --> 00:24:27,267
Thanks a lot. What are we to do with it?

374
00:24:27,506 --> 00:24:29,709
Put it in the woodshed,
where it belongs.

375
00:24:29,962 --> 00:24:33,268
The woodshed is full. I won't have
you cluttering up my kitchen with it.

376
00:24:33,731 --> 00:24:35,093
Very well then.

377
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,788
Oh dear ..

378
00:24:48,844 --> 00:24:50,225
What is it now?

379
00:24:54,808 --> 00:24:56,535
Wait until Miss Fiske sees this.

380
00:24:57,306 --> 00:24:59,938
What's the matter now? My goodness.

381
00:25:00,154 --> 00:25:02,116
More wood?
- Yes. Miss Emily dumped it.

382
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:04,986
Never mind. You get out of here.
- I got a nice lot today.

383
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:08,305
What are you thinking of? Making a
mess with it all over my clean floor.

384
00:25:08,521 --> 00:25:10,394
The girl wouldn't let
me put it in the kitchen.

385
00:25:10,671 --> 00:25:13,708
She's quite right. I told you to stop
bringing in wood. We have enough.

386
00:25:13,924 --> 00:25:16,497
I must tidy up the river
banks. I hate waste.

387
00:25:16,713 --> 00:25:18,995
And I hate litter. Now you
clear it away immediately.

388
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:21,201
I won't be ordered to do things.

389
00:25:22,767 --> 00:25:24,118
This is too much.

390
00:25:24,496 --> 00:25:26,293
My best polished table.

391
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:28,933
Look how these shells have scratched it.

392
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:31,965
What's this? Wet seaweed and a horrid ..

393
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,604
Dead bird.

394
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,561
Leave my bird alone. And my shells.

395
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,248
They are my treasures.

396
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,515
We don't understand expensive things.
It's so long since we had any.

397
00:25:41,981 --> 00:25:44,044
I know it's very simple of me.
But I am simple.

398
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,087
Emily .. what's wrong?

399
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:48,986
I hate her. She threw my
bird into the fireplace.

400
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,507
Emily, control yourself.

401
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:52,603
See what she's done
with her ridiculous shells.

402
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,816
It will take a month's
polishing to put it right.

403
00:25:55,032 --> 00:25:56,708
I'm sorry Miss Fiske, I'll put it right.

404
00:25:57,276 --> 00:26:00,394
No Ellen, you shan't. I'll do it.
Let me do it. I'll polish it.

405
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,434
Every day, all through the winter.

406
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,511
Sweet of you, Louisa. But I doubt
you'll be here through the winter.

407
00:26:05,969 --> 00:26:07,630
But we shall. Ellen said so.

408
00:26:07,953 --> 00:26:10,046
You're mistaken, Louisa.
I said nothing of the kind.

409
00:26:10,262 --> 00:26:12,701
But you did. You promised.
- Louisa, will you be quiet.

410
00:26:16,013 --> 00:26:18,157
My heavens. This is the last straw.

411
00:26:18,802 --> 00:26:20,996
You'll drive me as crazy as yourselves.

412
00:26:24,448 --> 00:26:25,406
Oh, Ellen.

413
00:26:27,312 --> 00:26:28,535
Miss Fiske.

414
00:26:29,134 --> 00:26:31,588
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to say that, but ..

415
00:26:32,377 --> 00:26:34,890
I've had about as much as I can endure.

416
00:26:36,396 --> 00:26:39,219
Emily .. take Louisa upstairs.

417
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,482
Now, stop your crying, Louisa.

418
00:26:42,358 --> 00:26:44,045
There's nothing to cry about.

419
00:26:45,286 --> 00:26:46,141
Do you hear?

420
00:26:46,743 --> 00:26:48,817
Go upstairs. Both of you.

421
00:26:51,981 --> 00:26:53,380
And close the door behind you.

422
00:26:58,271 --> 00:27:00,113
That was a cruel thing to say.

423
00:27:00,788 --> 00:27:01,944
But it's true.

424
00:27:02,778 --> 00:27:06,123
One with her telescope and the other
with her mania for collecting things.

425
00:27:06,703 --> 00:27:08,149
They are insane, both of them.

426
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:10,479
Please don't use that word again.

427
00:27:11,078 --> 00:27:12,310
Emily was right.

428
00:27:12,956 --> 00:27:14,664
But then people who
have all they want ..

429
00:27:15,013 --> 00:27:17,979
Never understand how much the smallest
things mean to those who haven't.

430
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,046
Really?

431
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,362
I don't think this calls for a sermon.

432
00:27:22,276 --> 00:27:24,365
I've been more than generous
to you and your sisters.

433
00:27:24,581 --> 00:27:26,750
People have always been very
generous to you, Miss Fiske.

434
00:27:26,966 --> 00:27:29,126
My sisters and I have never had
friends to send <i>us</i> money.

435
00:27:29,379 --> 00:27:31,480
That's hardly my fault, is it.
- No.

436
00:27:31,793 --> 00:27:35,189
Don't you feel you have a responsibility
to those less fortunate than you?

437
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,615
I don't know what you're talking about.

438
00:27:38,441 --> 00:27:40,476
Life hasn't been very
kind to us, Miss Fiske.

439
00:27:40,817 --> 00:27:42,798
Every penny we've ever
had, I've had to work for.

440
00:27:43,014 --> 00:27:45,706
Every penny. But at least
we have our self-respect.

441
00:27:47,024 --> 00:27:48,654
How dare you.

442
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,866
How dare you criticise my life.

443
00:27:52,216 --> 00:27:55,606
Do you think I don't envy women who
have respectability? Who have families?

444
00:27:55,822 --> 00:27:58,890
Who aren't just forgotten and pensioned
off when they lose their stock-in-trade.

445
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:01,196
Then you can't blame me
for fighting for my family.

446
00:28:01,412 --> 00:28:03,466
Very admirable, but it's
your family and not mine.

447
00:28:03,941 --> 00:28:05,065
Let me tell you this.

448
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,935
Your sisters, insane or not,
have overstayed their welcome.

449
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,611
I invite them here for two days
and they've stayed six weeks.

450
00:28:10,827 --> 00:28:13,450
Or perhaps you were planning
to keep them here forever?

451
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,324
Well .. I had thought ..

452
00:28:17,124 --> 00:28:19,622
That I might pay something out
of my wages for their keep.

453
00:28:19,895 --> 00:28:22,261
Ellen, you're a hypocrite.
You're worse, you're a cheat.

454
00:28:22,937 --> 00:28:26,279
You meant to foist your wretched
brood on me and bleed me white.

455
00:28:26,626 --> 00:28:30,814
And when I saw through your scheme, you
had the insolence to turn and abuse me.

456
00:28:31,124 --> 00:28:32,701
But you've chosen the wrong woman.

457
00:28:32,917 --> 00:28:35,255
You get those sisters of yours
out of this house at once.

458
00:28:35,604 --> 00:28:37,644
And take a month's wages
and go with them.

459
00:28:39,743 --> 00:28:40,815
Miss Fiske.

460
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:11,039
Ellen .. why aren't you in bed?

461
00:29:11,451 --> 00:29:13,179
Why are you prowling about at this hour?

462
00:29:13,761 --> 00:29:16,786
Miss Fiske, may I come in?
I must talk with you, please.

463
00:29:17,357 --> 00:29:18,516
Well, mind your tongue.

464
00:29:18,764 --> 00:29:20,987
We don't want any more of
this afternoon's unpleasantness.

465
00:29:23,612 --> 00:29:24,936
I'm sorry about that.

466
00:29:25,715 --> 00:29:27,833
I was wrong. I shouldn't
have spoken to you as I did.

467
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:30,462
No .. you shouldn't.

468
00:29:37,617 --> 00:29:38,744
Miss Fiske.

469
00:29:39,702 --> 00:29:42,303
Do you remember the letter that arrived
the day I went away to London?

470
00:29:42,556 --> 00:29:46,058
Yes .. what about it?
- It was from their landlady.

471
00:29:46,613 --> 00:29:47,747
Emily and Louisa.

472
00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:49,552
Had been a little difficult.

473
00:29:49,893 --> 00:29:51,137
She'd sent for the police.

474
00:29:52,329 --> 00:29:54,369
They were going to be
put away in an institution.

475
00:29:54,764 --> 00:29:57,034
The landlady was quite right.
That's where they belong.

476
00:29:57,393 --> 00:30:00,433
But Miss Fiske, you don't
understand. They're my sisters.

477
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,707
You don't know what I've
gone through for them.

478
00:30:02,923 --> 00:30:05,036
They've no-one else in the
world to turn to but me.

479
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,948
I pleaded with the police to release
them. They agreed on one condition.

480
00:30:09,533 --> 00:30:11,458
That they were to remain
in my personal care.

481
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:13,336
That I was to be responsible for them.

482
00:30:13,787 --> 00:30:15,440
And if there were any more complaints.

483
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,522
That they were to be put away forever.
That's why I can't send them away.

484
00:30:19,825 --> 00:30:21,889
All this devotion is
very admirable, Ellen.

485
00:30:22,285 --> 00:30:24,471
But I fail to see how I can
help in any way at all.

486
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:26,903
Oh but you can. You can, Miss Fiske.

487
00:30:27,618 --> 00:30:29,823
I thought perhaps they
might use the attic upstairs.

488
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:32,379
They'll stay there out of the
way where you don't see them.

489
00:30:32,716 --> 00:30:34,876
They could use the back stairs
when they come in and out.

490
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:37,055
Ellen, what are you talking about?

491
00:30:37,271 --> 00:30:40,267
I promise they'll never come near you.
You'll never know they're in the house.

492
00:30:40,829 --> 00:30:43,797
I'll look after them myself.
I'll cook their meals for them.

493
00:30:44,387 --> 00:30:46,231
I promise they won't
be any more trouble.

494
00:30:46,913 --> 00:30:49,120
Miss Fiske, they must
be with me, they must.

495
00:30:49,439 --> 00:30:51,590
I'll pay for their keep.
I'll work for nothing.

496
00:30:51,834 --> 00:30:54,509
Please .. oh, please Miss Fiske.

497
00:30:54,829 --> 00:30:56,720
Ellen, have you quite
gone out of your mind?

498
00:30:57,064 --> 00:31:00,126
You must be blind if you can't realise
they'd always be getting in my way.

499
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:02,612
You pack them off tomorrow.
- But, Miss Fiske. Won't ..?

500
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:04,369
No Ellen, my mind is made up.

501
00:31:05,471 --> 00:31:09,239
If you want to, you can stay here a few
days until you've found a new situation.

502
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:12,814
Now run along to bed. And make
certain they leave tomorrow.

503
00:31:14,132 --> 00:31:16,592
You wouldn't want me to be sending
for the police, would you?

504
00:31:18,682 --> 00:31:20,329
Goodnight Ellen. I'm tired.

505
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,186
Goodnight.

506
00:31:48,528 --> 00:31:50,908
But you told her you were
going to send us away.

507
00:31:52,592 --> 00:31:54,344
I'm not going to send you away.

508
00:31:54,732 --> 00:31:56,620
We heard you. We were listening.

509
00:31:57,784 --> 00:31:59,386
Isn't she terrible, Ellen?

510
00:32:00,207 --> 00:32:01,536
She's wicked.

511
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:04,907
I'm not going to send you away.

512
00:32:06,836 --> 00:32:07,678
Never.

513
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:11,269
If you're not sending us away,
what are you going to do?

514
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,293
I don't know.

515
00:32:16,674 --> 00:32:17,831
I must think.

516
00:32:30,078 --> 00:32:32,550
I've always wanted
to explore an old castle.

517
00:32:32,971 --> 00:32:35,857
Will it have a dungeon do you think?
- They all have dungeons.

518
00:32:36,191 --> 00:32:36,978
With bats.

519
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:39,138
No, dear. Bats are in belfries.

520
00:32:39,459 --> 00:32:43,180
There's sure to be secret passageways
and places where they'd hide things.

521
00:32:45,198 --> 00:32:46,346
Like that.

522
00:32:54,259 --> 00:32:58,372
Yes .. I'm sure Miss Fiske has lots
of exciting things hidden in there.

523
00:32:58,588 --> 00:33:00,212
Her jewels, I'm sure.

524
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:04,181
I've looked in all her boxes and
haven't been able to find them.

525
00:33:04,718 --> 00:33:07,167
Are you both ready?
- Oh yes. Quite.

526
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:10,004
I managed to pack all
the lunch into one bag.

527
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,630
Mine.

528
00:33:12,914 --> 00:33:15,600
Come here and sit down.
I want to talk to you both.

529
00:33:25,193 --> 00:33:25,808
Now.

530
00:33:26,107 --> 00:33:28,868
I haven't told you the real reason why
you're being sent away for a whole day.

531
00:33:29,589 --> 00:33:32,633
The truth is I want to be entirely
alone with Miss Fiske for a few hours.

532
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:34,817
Is that why you got rid of Lucy too?

533
00:33:35,131 --> 00:33:37,177
I didn't get rid of Lucy, Emily.
She had a toothache.

534
00:33:37,393 --> 00:33:40,293
Oh Ellen dear, you know that's
not true. She didn't want to go at all.

535
00:33:40,754 --> 00:33:42,833
I said she had a toothache, Louisa.

536
00:33:44,698 --> 00:33:45,628
Now listen.

537
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,408
Last night, while you were both asleep,
I had a long talk with Miss Fiske.

538
00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:52,867
She's tired of the marshes
and wants to travel for a bit.

539
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,633
I've persuaded her to
sell this house to me.

540
00:33:55,849 --> 00:33:58,210
Not really, Ellen?
- We haven't discussed price yet.

541
00:33:58,976 --> 00:34:02,422
That's why I must be alone with her, so
we can talk with nothing to distract us.

542
00:34:02,694 --> 00:34:05,355
She may want more than
you're prepared to pay.

543
00:34:07,101 --> 00:34:09,142
I'm prepared to pay
quite a big price, Emily.

544
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:11,442
Oh, lovely, lovely, lovely.

545
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,491
Oh Emily, aren't you excited?
- Louisa, be quiet.

546
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,415
Now, there's one more thing.

547
00:34:18,401 --> 00:34:19,716
The most important.

548
00:34:35,231 --> 00:34:36,722
You see this bible, both of you?

549
00:34:37,587 --> 00:34:39,899
I want you to swear on it.
By father's memory.

550
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:43,550
That you'll never repeat a word of my
buying this house as long as you live.

551
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:46,963
What do I say?

552
00:34:47,581 --> 00:34:48,963
Just say 'I swear'.

553
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,113
Oh .. I swear.

554
00:34:51,554 --> 00:34:52,484
You too, Emily.

555
00:34:52,787 --> 00:34:54,831
I won't swear on the bible. It's wicked.

556
00:34:55,435 --> 00:34:56,571
If you don't Emily ..

557
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:59,143
I shan't buy the house and I'll
send you both back to London.

558
00:34:59,426 --> 00:35:01,058
Oh Emily, be sensible.

559
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,984
I don't like being made
to do things .. I promise.

560

Now, remember.

561
00:35:07,527 --> 00:35:09,016
That's a sacred oath.

Here's Bates. Hurry now.
There's no time to waste.

Drive slowly Bates.
Please don't let them get cold.

You can take your time. I shan't be
expecting you back before dusk.

Goodbye Ellen. I wish you could come.
- I wish you were coming too.

May we never meet again.

May we come in?
- Yes.

576
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:28,536
I'd like to speak to Miss Ellen.
Unless Miss Fiske is back?

577
00:39:29,038 --> 00:39:32,096
No, she's still away. I'll fetch Ellen.

578
00:39:34,682 --> 00:39:36,292
We're making jam.

579

Good evening.

It isn't a very good one, is it?

No, as a matter of fact it's not.
Cats and dogs.

Good evening, Sisters.

Sorry to keep you waiting.

But we're in the middle of
putting up our quince jam.

00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,087
Please don't apologise. I'm afraid
we've come on a begging errand.

Our supplier of oil hasn't
arrived from Rochester.

if we might borrow a can until Sunday.

burning, I thought Miss Fiske was back.

No. It was quite unexpected.

So he can dry himself.

672
00:45:16,093 --> 00:45:17,967
Blimey, if that don't half
make my mouth water.

673
00:45:18,244 --> 00:45:21,154
Some nice, tasty grub and something
warm to chase it down the hatchway.

674
00:45:21,586 --> 00:45:22,690
That's what I need.

675
00:45:23,023 --> 00:45:25,422
Albert, tell me. Why have you come here?

676
00:45:26,169 --> 00:45:28,530
That can wait until I'm dry outside.
And not so dry, in.

677
00:45:28,779 --> 00:45:30,060
There you are, Albert.

678
00:45:30,552 --> 00:45:31,975
Thanks, me old cup of tea.

679
00:45:32,431 --> 00:45:34,816
Emily, slice off some beef,
and put out the bread and cheese.

680
00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:38,158
A pint of half-and-half would
be the proper ticket with that.

681
00:45:38,374 --> 00:45:39,680
This isn't a Tavern, Albert.

682
00:45:40,391 --> 00:45:43,061
How about a spot of brandy to
take the damp out of my throat?

683
00:45:43,426 --> 00:45:45,228
I'm unsure there's any
left in the decanter.

684
00:45:45,444 --> 00:45:46,717
There's some in the cellar.

685
00:45:47,395 --> 00:45:49,813
A cellar, eh? Your Ladyship,
allow me to lead you to it.

686
00:45:50,487 --> 00:45:52,705
No .. I'll go myself.

687
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,499
Make way for the Duchess.

688
00:46:27,321 --> 00:46:29,640
Blimey. The view from here
is the best on the marshes.

689
00:46:30,542 --> 00:46:33,481
I say auntie, is this all yours?
- No, of course not.

690
00:46:34,251 --> 00:46:36,166
It belongs to the woman
I work for. Miss Fiske.

691
00:46:37,011 --> 00:46:39,510
Where is she, might I ask?
- Away.

692
00:46:41,683 --> 00:46:44,148
Five years, auntie old girl.
- What of it?

693
00:46:44,453 --> 00:46:46,646
You've changed.
- You've not.

694
00:46:47,504 --> 00:46:50,373
The same big blue eyes though.
You're still Lady touch-me-not.

695
00:46:50,847 --> 00:46:53,265
Let go of me. I'm in no
mood for your foolishness.

696
00:46:54,208 --> 00:46:55,739
The way you seem to be all keyed up.

697
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:58,072
A little of my foolishness
just might do you no harm.

698
00:47:01,721 --> 00:47:02,961
Here's your food, Albert.

699
00:47:04,313 --> 00:47:07,205
Run up to bed, both of you.
I want to talk with Albert.

700
00:47:07,421 --> 00:47:10,580
But we don't want to go to bed.
- No, we want to stay to talk to Albert.

701
00:47:10,905 --> 00:47:13,857
Go on, do as aunt Ellen says. Toddle off
to bye-byes like good little girls.

702
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:16,821
Here, wait. Why don't you wet your
whistles. It will make you sleep tight.

703
00:47:17,178 --> 00:47:19,055
Sleep tight. Albert, you are silly.

704
00:47:19,553 --> 00:47:22,004
I don't think they'd better, Albert.
- What's the harm?

705
00:47:22,483 --> 00:47:24,708
You don't have a long-lost
nephew every night of the week.

706
00:47:25,121 --> 00:47:26,369
Fetch some glasses, Emily.

707
00:47:26,585 --> 00:47:29,797
Very well, but not too much now.
- Just a tiny thimbleful for me, Albert.

708
00:47:31,252 --> 00:47:32,688
How about you, aunt Ellen?

709
00:47:33,327 --> 00:47:34,716
Nothing for me, thank you.

710
00:47:37,757 --> 00:47:40,199
Now, my Siamese twins.
What about a toast, eh?

711
00:47:40,523 --> 00:47:41,905
I don't know any.

712
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:44,008
In that case, here's to absent friends.

713
00:47:44,328 --> 00:47:45,464
Absent friends.

714
00:47:46,046 --> 00:47:48,543
Ellen, I suppose we
should think of Miss Fiske.

715
00:48:01,321 --> 00:48:03,604
Who put out those candles?
- What candles?

716
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,445
Oh those.
- It must have been the wind.

717
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:11,998
Goodnight, Albert.
- Goodnight my lady.

718
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,204
Goodnight, Albert.
- Goodnight.

719
00:48:21,642 --> 00:48:23,379
It wasn't the wind, Ellen.

720
00:48:38,904 --> 00:48:41,109
I say auntie, you've not
turned Roman have you?

721
00:48:41,466 --> 00:48:42,763
I do this for a friend.

722
00:48:48,243 --> 00:48:49,129
Now, Albert.

723
00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:52,134
Let's stop all this 'auntie' nonsense
and get down to cases.

724
00:48:52,862 --> 00:48:54,748
Why have you come here
and what do you want?

725
00:48:55,073 --> 00:48:56,918
Well auntie .. I mean, Ellen.

726
00:48:57,692 --> 00:49:02,208
To cut it fine, I'm taking a compulsory
holiday from my bank over in Gravesend.

727
00:49:02,602 --> 00:49:05,107
In other words, you've lost your job.
- I've given it up.

728
00:49:05,738 --> 00:49:07,522
You haven't done anything
wrong, have you?

729
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:11,605
I sort-of helped myself to a
little salary I wasn't entitled to.

730
00:49:12,885 --> 00:49:14,393
You mean, you've stolen money.

731
00:49:16,415 --> 00:49:19,181
This is rattling good brandy.
- Answer me, Albert.

732
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:23,848
You've got it.
- How much?

733
00:49:24,594 --> 00:49:27,402
A small matter of a hundred pounds.
- I'll see.

734
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:33,271
I suppose you want me to give you the
hundred pounds so you can put it back?

735
00:49:33,515 --> 00:49:36,477
I'm afraid it's too late for that.
They found out, the police.

736
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:38,164
The police?

737
00:49:38,389 --> 00:49:42,016
A friend passed me the tip they were
coming. So I .. I took French leave.

738
00:49:42,455 --> 00:49:44,956
But .. they'll follow you.
They'll come here.

739
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,774
Don't worry .. no-one knows I've got
relations out here on the marshes.

740
00:49:51,122 --> 00:49:52,699
I'll be safe here for a lifetime.

741
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:55,319
You're certainly not going
to stay here for a lifetime.

742
00:49:55,769 --> 00:49:57,815
Surely you don't mind me
staying for a while, do you?

743
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,745
Until it all blows over.
- Then what do you propose to do?

744
00:50:01,094 --> 00:50:03,725
Clear out of the country.
America, Australia. Any old where.

745
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,552
I'm .. counting on you to help me.

746
00:50:06,868 --> 00:50:08,188
I need money for my passage.

747
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:09,630
I'm .. I'm stony.

748
00:50:11,353 --> 00:50:13,246
It won't cost much. Steerage.

749
00:50:13,691 --> 00:50:15,882
I don't see why I should concern
myself with your affairs.

750
00:50:16,414 --> 00:50:17,870
I'll land in prison if you don't.

751
00:50:19,541 --> 00:50:22,420
You're not the sort to turn anybody down
who's in trouble and needed your help.

752
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:24,969
You wouldn't fail your
own flesh and blood.

753
00:50:25,185 --> 00:50:27,020
I'm no flesh and blood of yours, Albert.

754
00:50:27,468 --> 00:50:29,199
Won't you give me a
chance to start again?

755
00:50:29,415 --> 00:50:30,734
I promise. Cross my heart.

756
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:33,457
I'll never do anything wrong
again for the rest of my natural.

757
00:50:33,673 --> 00:50:35,143
Let me go.

758
00:50:41,301 --> 00:50:44,030
Very well. I'll do it.
- Bless you, Ellen.

759
00:50:44,415 --> 00:50:46,973
You're a daisy, you are.
- We'll talk about it in the morning.

760
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,180
You can sleep on the sofa tonight.
- I don't mind where I sleep.

761
00:50:50,396 --> 00:50:51,419
But mind you ..

762
00:50:51,635 --> 00:50:54,218
You can only stay until I've
arranged your passage on the boat.

763
00:50:54,434 --> 00:50:57,466
Anything you say,
Ellen old girl .. what's that?

764
00:50:57,983 --> 00:50:59,945
That's just the maid.
She's been out on an errand.

765
00:51:01,006 --> 00:51:02,550
Lucy.
- Yes, Miss?

766
00:51:04,518 --> 00:51:06,220
They'll be a gentleman
staying the night.

767
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:07,819
A gentleman staying?

768
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:09,776
A relation. He'll sleep in here.

769
00:51:10,033 --> 00:51:12,679
Now go to your room and change your
wet clothes before you start sneezing.

770
00:51:12,895 --> 00:51:15,090
Yes, Miss .. goodnight.
- Goodnight.

771
00:51:15,306 --> 00:51:16,096
Goodnight.

772
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:17,557
'Lucy', is it?

773
00:51:19,035 --> 00:51:20,472
Yes .. Lucy.

774
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:25,687
I fancy that's all for
tonight, aunt Ellen.

775
00:51:26,138 --> 00:51:29,180
I'll just have a weed before
I turn in. The last of the day.

776
00:51:30,306 --> 00:51:32,729
You seem to be taking this
all very lightly, Albert.

777
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,166
You have told me the worst, haven't you?

778
00:51:35,601 --> 00:51:38,110
I mean, there isn't anything else?
- What else?

779
00:51:40,653 --> 00:51:42,212
There are worse things than stealing.

780
00:51:42,987 --> 00:51:43,994
For instance?

781
00:51:45,828 --> 00:51:47,359
No, there's no blood on my hands.

782
00:51:47,743 --> 00:51:49,703
Putting people out calls
for <i>real </i>nerve, you know.

783
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:55,303
Yes.

784
00:51:59,547 --> 00:52:01,321
Goodnight, Albert.
- Nighty night.

785
00:53:12,967 --> 00:53:15,145
Did you enjoy the sermon, Mr Bates?

786
00:53:15,603 --> 00:53:16,818
Mighty powerful, Miss.

787
00:53:17,293 --> 00:53:18,797
Yes. It was, wasn't it.

788
00:53:20,284 --> 00:53:22,109
But there was a lot I didn't understand.

789
00:53:23,490 --> 00:53:24,866
The part that went ..

790
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:26,568
How was it?

791
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,004
The wicked flee.

792
00:53:30,087 --> 00:53:32,717
When no man .. pursueth.

793
00:53:34,739 --> 00:53:36,575
But .. but ..

794
00:53:38,561 --> 00:53:41,233
The righteous are as bold as a lion.

795
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:09,297
Well.

796
00:54:10,743 --> 00:54:12,479
What do you think you're doing?

797
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:16,840
I fooled around with this padlock
last night and it .. came off.

798
00:54:17,592 --> 00:54:18,689
You shouldn't have.

799
00:54:19,344 --> 00:54:21,297
That's where Miss Fiske
keeps her valuables.

800
00:54:21,551 --> 00:54:23,794
How does she get at them?
With a pickaxe? Look.

801
00:54:25,898 --> 00:54:28,667
Well I never. All bricked up.

802
00:54:29,531 --> 00:54:31,248
I wonder why that was done.

803
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:33,342
It wasn't that way the
last time I was here.

804
00:54:33,821 --> 00:54:35,868
So you've had your nose
in there before, have you?

805
00:54:36,948 --> 00:54:39,174
Funny what nasty thoughts
people have sometimes, isn't it.

806
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:41,597
Funny how they're right
sometimes, isn't it.

807
00:54:59,037 --> 00:55:01,443
I wonder why anyone would want
to brick up a place like that?

808
00:55:02,492 --> 00:55:05,171
Maybe Miss Fiske put her jewels
in there before she went away.

809
00:55:05,807 --> 00:55:08,881
You know .. she's not one to take
any chances leaving them about.

810
00:55:09,234 --> 00:55:10,530
Even with your aunt Ellen.

811
00:55:12,817 --> 00:55:15,523
If there are any sparkles in there,
I wouldn't mind having a peep at them.

812
00:55:15,748 --> 00:55:18,262
I'm sure you wouldn't.
- And neither would you, I dare say.

813
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:24,037
In fact .. I'm sure you'd like the feel
of some around your swan-like neck.

814
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:28,629
A pretty pink ear like
that calls for diamonds.

815
00:55:29,014 --> 00:55:31,473
A wandering hand like yours
calls for a slap in the face.

816
00:55:31,821 --> 00:55:33,675
It's wicked to slap a
man's face on a Sunday.

817
00:55:33,981 --> 00:55:35,745
The better the day, the better the deed.

818
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:37,595
That leaves my conscience clear.

819
00:55:42,243 --> 00:55:43,680
I'll scream.

820
00:55:45,098 --> 00:55:46,140
What's that?

821
00:55:52,703 --> 00:55:55,550
What do you think I'm made of?
- Sugar and spice.

822
00:55:56,874 --> 00:55:58,131
And everything nice.

823
00:56:01,849 --> 00:56:03,164
Blimey, you're strong.

824
00:56:06,001 --> 00:56:07,586
It's a wig. Whose is it?

825
00:56:08,854 --> 00:56:10,150
It is Miss Fiske's.

826
00:56:10,705 --> 00:56:12,391
Oh, it's her best one.

827
00:56:13,295 --> 00:56:15,239
She's as bald as a coot.
- Ah.

828
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,042
A wonder she didn't take it with her.

829
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,267
Hello.

830
00:56:19,605 --> 00:56:22,290
Ah, she left a lot of
her fancy dresses too.

831
00:56:23,063 --> 00:56:24,930
Perhaps she'll buy some
new ones up in London?

832
00:56:25,392 --> 00:56:26,938
These are new. Most of them.

833
00:56:27,918 --> 00:56:30,059
You'd better put that back up.
- Alright.

834
00:56:30,285 --> 00:56:31,783
Get up on this chair.

835
00:56:39,798 --> 00:56:41,554
You know, it <i>is</i> odd
she only took one wig.

836
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:45,357
On a trip, anything might happen.
A fire or a gust of wind.

837
00:56:45,751 --> 00:56:46,409
Oh.

838
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,195
Here's Emily coming up the path.

839
00:56:50,109 --> 00:56:51,329
You'd better be off.

840
00:56:57,184 --> 00:56:58,794
Hello my old cup of tea.

841
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:02,634
What are you doing with those
bull-rushes? Looking for Moses?

842
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:06,371
You're making fun of me .. naughty boy.

843
00:57:28,649 --> 00:57:31,405
Hello Ducky .. I'm glad you're
back before the others.

844
00:57:31,964 --> 00:57:34,668
It isn't often I have the chance of
a tête-à-tête with the family's fairest.

845
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:36,672
You're never serious
about anything, Albert.

846
00:57:36,888 --> 00:57:38,846
I was never more serious in my life.

847
00:57:40,212 --> 00:57:42,518
The storm did an enormous
amount of damage.

848
00:57:42,869 --> 00:57:45,494
Roads into Rochester and Gravesend
were completely flooded.

849
00:57:46,258 --> 00:57:48,836
The Postman told me.
- I hope they stay that way.

850
00:57:50,098 --> 00:57:51,558
Allow me, Empress.

851
00:57:52,362 --> 00:57:54,681
There's only one letter today.
It's for Miss Fiske.

852
00:57:55,047 --> 00:57:55,755
Is it?

853
00:58:01,577 --> 00:58:03,226
It's a cosy nest you got here.

854
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,661
What's will happen to you
when Miss Fiske gets back?

855
00:58:05,896 --> 00:58:07,596
Will she let you stay on, do you think?

856
00:58:11,455 --> 00:58:12,701
She isn't coming back.

857
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:14,548
Why not?

858
00:58:15,342 --> 00:58:16,575
Ellen's bought the house.

859
00:58:19,252 --> 00:58:19,924
Go on.

860
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:21,241
Yes. It's quite true.

861
00:58:22,049 --> 00:58:23,150
It's a secret though.

862
00:58:23,366 --> 00:58:26,001
Ellen made us swear on the bible
that we wouldn't tell anyone.

863
00:58:26,218 --> 00:58:28,300
But you are one of the family.
So it's alright.

864
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:31,661
Why should she want
to keep it a secret, eh?

865
00:58:31,877 --> 00:58:33,636
I don't know.
It was done in a great hurry.

866
00:58:33,873 --> 00:58:35,534
Louisa and I were sent off to Rochester.

867
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:38,669
Then when we came back that night,
Miss Fiske was gone and it was all over.

868
00:58:40,902 --> 00:58:42,862
You won't tell Ellen I told
you, will you, Albert?

869
00:58:43,234 --> 00:58:43,975
No.

870
00:58:45,212 --> 00:58:47,000
We'll make that our
little secret, shall we?

871
00:58:47,335 --> 00:58:48,064
Alright.

872
00:58:50,086 --> 00:58:52,513
It will be rather fun.
Having a secret from Ellen.

873
00:58:53,143 --> 00:58:55,628
She thinks she's the clever one.
But she isn't.

874
00:58:57,109 --> 00:58:57,924
Not always.

875
00:58:59,816 --> 00:59:00,402
No.

876
00:59:01,225 --> 00:59:02,040
Not always.

877
00:59:17,517 --> 00:59:19,294
Albert.
- What?

878
00:59:25,153 --> 00:59:26,418
Good morning.

879
00:59:28,974 --> 00:59:30,034
May we come in?

880
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:32,261
Who's that?
- A couple of nuns from The Priory.

881
00:59:33,048 --> 00:59:36,099
You talk to them, Albert.
I've got to tidy up the orchard.

882
00:59:47,032 --> 00:59:51,087
Oh .. I didn't know there was
a young man staying here.

883
00:59:51,632 --> 00:59:52,844
Is Miss Ellen about?

884
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,956
Sorry. She's gone over to the church at
Cawley. I'm her nephew, can I help?

885
00:59:56,487 --> 01:00:00,357
We came to return this. She lent us
a little oil last night. We ran short.

886
01:00:00,792 --> 01:00:02,060
Thanks.
- Yes, and this.

887
01:00:02,634 --> 01:00:04,846
The rent for the little field.
Your aunt will understand.

888
01:00:05,106 --> 01:00:06,179
I'll give it to her.

889
01:00:06,395 --> 01:00:08,788
We are so looking forward
to Miss Fiske's return.

890
01:00:09,371 --> 01:00:10,864
She's a dear friend of ours.

891
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:14,646
Oh .. have you .. heard from her lately?

892
01:00:15,031 --> 01:00:16,218
No, not a word.

893
01:00:16,752 --> 01:00:19,335
I think the Reverend Mother is
a trifle hurt she hasn't written.

894
01:00:19,678 --> 01:00:22,281
In fact, she didn't even tell
us she was going away.

895
01:00:22,777 --> 01:00:25,295
Not very chummy, was it.
- No, it wasn't.

896
01:00:26,837 --> 01:00:28,232
Good morning.
- Good morning.

897
01:01:05,242 --> 01:01:07,671
Now what are you up to?
- Fetch me a knife, Ducky.

898
01:01:15,499 --> 01:01:17,170
What's that?
- A letter for Miss Fiske.

899
01:01:17,511 --> 01:01:19,943
You're not going to open it?
- No. Wouldn't think of it.

900
01:01:24,242 --> 01:01:25,431
What's it say?

901
01:01:26,201 --> 01:01:28,502
'Dear Madam.
Regarding your instructions ..'

902
01:01:28,718 --> 01:01:31,591
'To forward the amount of the
enclosed cheque in 5-pound notes'.

903
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:36,889
'Your signature appears to differ from
that with which we are acquainted'.

904
01:01:38,793 --> 01:01:41,444
'We should be obliged if you
could kindly confirm same ..'

905
01:01:41,845 --> 01:01:44,354
'By signing it afresh.
In your usual manner'.

906
01:01:48,582 --> 01:01:49,634
Fifty pounds.

907
01:01:50,633 --> 01:01:51,591
Notice the date.

908
01:01:52,218 --> 01:01:53,703
'October 14th'.

909
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:57,258
That's three days ago.
She's been gone longer than that.

910
01:01:57,803 --> 01:01:59,484
Since the beginning of September.

911
01:02:00,292 --> 01:02:02,329
She probably made it
out from wherever she is.

912
01:02:02,949 --> 01:02:04,986
Yes, she could have. Hey, wait a minute.

913
01:02:06,442 --> 01:02:08,765
In that case, why did they
send the reply to her here?

914
01:02:10,183 --> 01:02:11,666
You see who it's made payable to?

915
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:14,680
Ellen Creed.

916
01:02:15,506 --> 01:02:17,785
What of it? I expect it's
the housekeeping money.

917
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:21,488
Maybe. Where's the glue-pot?
- Over there.

918
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:23,015
Get it for me.

919
01:02:28,096 --> 01:02:30,146
Dip your finger in it.
- I should say not.

920
01:02:30,516 --> 01:02:31,817
I've had no hand in this.

921
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:33,963
Haven't you?

922
01:02:35,383 --> 01:02:37,379
You are a filthy pig.
- Go on. Seal it up.

923
01:02:38,971 --> 01:02:39,930
Go on.

924
01:02:44,402 --> 01:02:46,276
Don't forget.
You're in this as deep as me now.

925
01:02:46,550 --> 01:02:48,124
I wish you'd never come here.

926
01:02:48,888 --> 01:02:51,488
I don't know what comes over
me when you're around.

927
01:02:52,752 --> 01:02:54,483
You won't give me away
to Ellen, will you?

928
01:02:54,699 --> 01:02:56,230
I won't if you keep your mouth shut.

929
01:03:03,357 --> 01:03:06,241
Here come the performing seals.
Not a word, mind you.

930
01:03:17,604 --> 01:03:18,397
Albert.

931
01:03:18,622 --> 01:03:20,252
Hello, aunts .. had a nice pray?

932
01:03:20,492 --> 01:03:22,114
You should have been at church, Albert.

933
01:03:22,576 --> 01:03:24,609
The minister told us all about Hell.

934
01:03:25,016 --> 01:03:27,336
You'd have enjoyed the
bit about the lost souls ..

935
01:03:27,682 --> 01:03:29,251
Sizzling in the bottomless pit.

936
01:03:29,554 --> 01:03:31,970
Would I now? Sounds frightening.

937
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:34,859
Ellen .. where is Hell?

938
01:03:37,451 --> 01:03:39,443
Hell is like the Kingdom of Heaven.

939
01:03:41,672 --> 01:03:42,552
It is within.

940
01:03:43,037 --> 01:03:43,995
That reminds me.

941
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:45,926
One of your religious friends was here.

942
01:03:46,258 --> 01:03:49,076
She left you this.
It's the rent for some field or other.

943
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:52,568
She didn't see you, did she?
- I couldn't avoid it.

944
01:03:52,784 --> 01:03:54,258
That was Sister Theresa.

945
01:03:55,171 --> 01:03:59,138
She's Miss Fiske's friend. She doesn't
like us any more than Miss Fiske did.

946
01:03:59,974 --> 01:04:01,311
Didn't Miss Fiske like you?

947
01:04:01,981 --> 01:04:03,098
She was horrid to us.

948
01:04:03,344 --> 01:04:05,103
Louisa, run upstairs
and change your dress.

949
01:04:05,417 --> 01:04:07,148
You can't sit around
in your best all day.

950
01:04:07,445 --> 01:04:08,575
No. I shan't, shall I.

951
01:04:09,221 --> 01:04:10,348
No. Of course not.

952
01:04:12,538 --> 01:04:13,819
Albert.
- Huh?

953
01:04:14,096 --> 01:04:16,776
I don't want you to mention Miss Fiske
again in front of my sisters.

954
01:04:17,336 --> 01:04:18,819
They quarrelled with her.

955
01:04:19,382 --> 01:04:21,392
And it upsets them very
much to talk about her.

956
01:04:22,012 --> 01:04:23,364
Sorry. Nobody told me.

957
01:04:24,555 --> 01:04:26,055
What did you quarrel about?

958
01:04:26,666 --> 01:04:28,328
I didn't say I quarrelled with her.

959
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,220
Would she by any chance be the friend
you lit those candles for last night?

960
01:04:37,276 --> 01:04:38,187
Yes.

961
01:04:39,145 --> 01:04:40,469
When did she die?

962
01:04:42,779 --> 01:04:43,699
Die?

963
01:04:44,779 --> 01:04:46,516
Who said anything about her being dead?

964
01:04:47,042 --> 01:04:50,858
I just assumed she was.
You don't light candles for the living.

965
01:04:51,493 --> 01:04:53,352
Do you?
- I don't know.

966
01:04:54,178 --> 01:04:55,831
I just thought they stood for prayer.

967
01:04:56,685 --> 01:04:58,451
I must find Emily.
- By the way.

968
01:04:58,779 --> 01:05:00,614
The postman gave her
a letter for Miss Fiske.

969
01:05:00,911 --> 01:05:02,450
From her bank, I believe.

970
01:05:03,202 --> 01:05:04,375
Give it to me.

971
01:05:14,895 --> 01:05:16,951
I'm managing all her
affairs while she's away.

972
01:05:29,109 --> 01:05:31,579
Anything important?
- Yes, rather.

973
01:05:32,625 --> 01:05:34,512
I must get an answer
in the post immediately.

974
01:05:39,075 --> 01:05:40,763
A stylish looking piano you've got here.

975
01:05:41,029 --> 01:05:43,016
Don't distract me, Albert.
I must concentrate.

976
01:05:43,301 --> 01:05:45,026
I'm sorry. Don't mind me, auntie.

977
01:05:59,907 --> 01:06:01,335
I say, you are up to date.

978
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:04,648
I didn't expect to find a copy of
The Mikado way out here on the marshes.

979
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:12,747
[ Whistling song: Tit-Willow ]

980
01:06:20,224 --> 01:06:21,491
Don't do that.

981
01:06:22,064 --> 01:06:24,252
I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to distract you.

982
01:06:25,378 --> 01:06:27,960
It's just I happen to dislike that
particular tune. That's all.

983
01:06:28,261 --> 01:06:29,932
It's a bit on the morbid side.

984
01:06:35,775 --> 01:06:37,740
Miss Ellen, how soon
will you want dinner?

985
01:06:38,044 --> 01:06:39,402
In a quarter of an hour, Lucy.

986
01:06:39,624 --> 01:06:41,383
I'll just post this
letter at the crossing.

987
01:06:41,801 --> 01:06:42,788
Let me go, Ellen.

988
01:06:43,019 --> 01:06:44,372
I can do with a sniff of air.

989
01:06:44,588 --> 01:06:46,710
No thank you.
I prefer to attend to this myself.

990
01:07:20,938 --> 01:07:22,723
What are you up to now?

991
01:07:23,124 --> 01:07:24,998
She just wrote a reply to
the letter we opened.

992
01:07:25,426 --> 01:07:27,560
I thought it would be interesting
to see what she says.

993
01:07:28,703 --> 01:07:29,518
'Dear sir'.

994
01:07:30,198 --> 01:07:30,956
'Cheque'.

995
01:07:31,301 --> 01:07:32,168
Something.

996
01:07:32,562 --> 01:07:33,406
'Incorrect'.

997
01:07:34,231 --> 01:07:35,018
Something.

998
01:07:35,529 --> 01:07:36,258
'Owing'.

999
01:07:36,987 --> 01:07:38,671
Something, something.

1000
01:07:39,444 --> 01:07:40,350
'Wrist'.

1001
01:07:41,875 --> 01:07:43,870
What does that word
look like to you? See.

1002
01:07:44,636 --> 01:07:47,233
'S .. p .. r ..'

1003
01:07:47,779 --> 01:07:48,718
S .. p .. r.

1004
01:07:49,226 --> 01:07:50,685
'Sprained'. That's it.

1005
01:07:51,092 --> 01:07:52,394
'Owing to a sprained wrist'.

1006
01:07:53,878 --> 01:07:54,922
Something. 'Yours'.

1007
01:07:55,374 --> 01:07:56,225
'Leonora'.

1008
01:07:57,357 --> 01:07:58,758
'Leonora Fiske'.

1009
01:08:01,625 --> 01:08:03,040
She signed it 'Leonora Fiske'.

1010
01:08:03,525 --> 01:08:04,684
What's it mean, Albert?

1011
01:08:05,493 --> 01:08:06,665
What do you think?

1012
01:08:07,266 --> 01:08:09,506
It looks as if she's pretending
to be Miss Fiske.

1013
01:08:10,308 --> 01:08:12,239
Getting money on the strength of it.
- Brilliant.

1014
01:08:12,455 --> 01:08:13,845
If that's true, she's a thief.

1015
01:08:14,342 --> 01:08:15,535
Like you.
- Shut up.

1016
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:20,417
What will happen when
Miss Fiske comes back?

1017
01:08:23,624 --> 01:08:25,061
Suppose she isn't coming back?

1018
01:08:26,187 --> 01:08:29,149
Suppose she's died somewhere.
And Ellen is the only one who knows.

1019
01:08:29,485 --> 01:08:31,229
You can't die and only
one person know it.

1020
01:08:31,445 --> 01:08:32,744
Can't you? I'm not so sure.

1021
01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:35,600
One thing I do know.

1022
01:08:35,906 --> 01:08:38,896
She'd never risk it unless she knew
Miss Fiske was out of the way for good.

1023
01:08:39,955 --> 01:08:43,091
Alright .. assume she's dead.
Aunt Ellen is having the funds.

1024
01:08:43,645 --> 01:08:45,721
It might be years before
anybody would find out.

1025
01:08:48,011 --> 01:08:49,815
Why should she reap all the benefit?

1026
01:08:55,455 --> 01:08:57,100
There may be some pickings in it for us.

1027
01:08:57,481 --> 01:08:59,841
Would you like to see a bit of the
world? Have some fun with me?

1028
01:09:00,057 --> 01:09:01,907
You'd tempt Old Nick
himself, wouldn't you?

1029
01:09:02,123 --> 01:09:03,540
You've got to help me get proof.

1030
01:09:03,775 --> 01:09:05,763
I don't want to do anything
mean or underhanded.

1031
01:09:06,113 --> 01:09:09,069
Would I ask you to? Use your eyes
and keep your ears open. That's all.

1032
01:09:09,863 --> 01:09:10,821
What do you say?

1033
01:09:11,696 --> 01:09:12,720
I don't know.

1034
01:09:12,936 --> 01:09:14,752
Perhaps this will help
you make up your mind.

1035
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:22,321
Well?
- I'll help you, Albert.

1036
01:09:23,541 --> 01:09:25,685
Here she comes. Look sharp now.
Back to the kitchen.

1037
01:10:47,655 --> 01:10:48,984
She's coming.

1038
01:10:49,341 --> 01:10:51,214
Blimey. You almost made
me frightened myself.

1039
01:10:51,698 --> 01:10:53,567
Hurry up, hurry up.
- Alright. Shut up.

1040
01:10:57,097 --> 01:10:59,119
Hey, go in the kitchen
and make some tea.

1041
01:11:00,769 --> 01:11:03,053
Take this with you. Go on, hurry.

1042
01:11:08,868 --> 01:11:10,408
Goodnight, Bates.
- Night, ma'am.

1043
01:11:10,665 --> 01:11:12,424
Don't forget.
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

1044
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:13,710
Very good, ma'am.

1045
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:25,960
Did you have a successful trip?

1046
01:11:29,358 --> 01:11:30,324
Yes.

1047
01:11:31,452 --> 01:11:32,615
I have your ticket.

1048
01:11:33,462 --> 01:11:35,112
You leave tomorrow.

1049
01:11:36,730 --> 01:11:37,873
Do I?

1050
01:11:38,909 --> 01:11:41,037
Where are my sisters?
- I sent them off to bed.

1051
01:11:41,594 --> 01:11:44,567
They were getting a little out of hand.
- I dare say it wasn't their fault.

1052
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:46,694
Lucy is making some hot tea.

1053
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:48,628
We thought you might be cold.

1054
01:11:49,171 --> 01:11:51,500
I'll be down again .. as soon as
I've said goodnight to them.

1055
01:12:05,306 --> 01:12:06,436
Is everything alright?

1056
01:12:06,652 --> 01:12:09,253
No it's not. She's packing me off
tomorrow. We've got to move fast.

1057
01:12:10,013 --> 01:12:14,109
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
- I couldn't refuse you anything .. now.

1058
01:12:17,711 --> 01:12:20,732
We thought you'd never come,
Ellen .. I was frightened.

1059
01:12:21,412 --> 01:12:22,227
Frightened?

1060
01:12:22,443 --> 01:12:24,128
Yes, they were such funny noises.

1061
01:12:24,896 --> 01:12:26,049
It was only the rats.

1062
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:29,343
What have you been doing all evening?

1063
01:12:29,794 --> 01:12:33,166
We played a game of cribbage.
Of course, Albert cheated.

1064
01:12:33,475 --> 01:12:35,420
But it was rather fun
watching him cheat.

1065
01:12:36,156 --> 01:12:38,001
He hasn't said anything
about Miss Fiske?

1066
01:12:38,432 --> 01:12:39,681
No.
- Miss Fiske?

1067
01:12:41,073 --> 01:12:41,974
Why should he?

1068
01:12:42,322 --> 01:12:44,819
And neither of you spoke to him
about my buying the house?

1069
01:12:45,173 --> 01:12:46,021
No, Ellen.

1070
01:12:46,441 --> 01:12:47,399
Do you remember?

1071
01:12:47,678 --> 01:12:49,855
You made us swear on
the bible we wouldn't.

1072
01:12:53,352 --> 01:12:55,327
I think you'd better go to
sleep now, both of you.

1073
01:12:55,778 --> 01:12:58,491
I'm going downstairs to have a
hot cup of tea before I go to bed.

1074
01:13:11,633 --> 01:13:14,151
Albert, do you think ..?
- Pour the tea, Lucy.

1075
01:13:21,955 --> 01:13:24,408
Thank you Lucy. You may go to bed now.
- Yes, Miss Ellen.

1076
01:13:24,946 --> 01:13:26,345
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1077
01:13:36,366 --> 01:13:37,639
Auntie, where is your cane?

1078
01:13:38,312 --> 01:13:40,981
You look like you'd like to take down
my breeches and give me a dozen.

1079
01:13:42,223 --> 01:13:45,038
There's a boat sailing for Canada
on Friday. You sail with it.

1080
01:13:46,295 --> 01:13:47,826
I'm not sure I want to go to Canada.

1081
01:13:48,849 --> 01:13:49,693
Yet a while.

1082
01:13:50,173 --> 01:13:51,779
You haven't much choice, have you?

1083
01:13:52,201 --> 01:13:54,201
I don't know. I'm getting
quite fond of this place.

1084
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:57,278
The air suits me .. I'm very
happy here for the time being.

1085
01:13:57,793 --> 01:13:59,765
I'm not happy having you here.
- Why?

1086
01:14:01,027 --> 01:14:03,956
It isn't safe since Sister Theresa
knows you're staying here with us.

1087
01:14:04,613 --> 01:14:07,129
The wrong sort of talk would bring
the police around here in no time.

1088
01:14:07,692 --> 01:14:09,826
I don't propose to risk a
scandal on your account.

1089
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:12,484
There's more to it than that.

1090
01:14:13,552 --> 01:14:14,914
Lucy is apt to talk.

1091
01:14:15,787 --> 01:14:17,383
I don't think we need worry about her.

1092
01:14:18,557 --> 01:14:20,578
No. You've made sure of that.

1093
01:14:21,269 --> 01:14:24,026
Whatever do you mean by that?
- You know what, you cheap little ..

1094
01:14:24,454 --> 01:14:26,419
Stop it Ellen.
You'll make me lose my temper.

1095
01:14:26,784 --> 01:14:27,717
Your temper?

1096
01:14:27,975 --> 01:14:30,803
You leave first thing in the morning.
That's the end of you and your temper.

1097
01:14:31,019 --> 01:14:32,487
I shouldn't try to bluff me.

1098
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:36,020
I'm not bluffing you. I order you.
- If I don't choose to be ordered?

1099
01:14:36,755 --> 01:14:39,395
I can't throw you out physically.
But I can send for the police.

1100
01:14:39,611 --> 01:14:40,765
And have your scandal?

1101
01:14:41,425 --> 01:14:43,625
Really, you're being very
inconsistent now, auntie dear.

1102
01:14:47,747 --> 01:14:49,119
You won't send for the police.

1103
01:14:50,349 --> 01:14:51,841
Why are you so sure?

1104
01:14:52,573 --> 01:14:53,992
Because you've another reason.

1105
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:56,914
A more important reason for
not wanting the police here.

1106
01:14:57,546 --> 01:14:59,799
For wanting me out of this
house as quickly as possible.

1107
01:15:01,265 --> 01:15:02,936
As a matter of fact, you are right.

1108
01:15:03,339 --> 01:15:04,889
Now we get down to brass tacks.

1109
01:15:09,192 --> 01:15:11,134
Did it concern Miss Fiske by any chance?

1110
01:15:12,843 --> 01:15:14,271
It would and it does.

1111
01:15:15,303 --> 01:15:18,769
I met her in town today.
She's coming back.

1112
01:15:21,002 --> 01:15:24,068
She's coming back?
- And why shouldn't she?

1113
01:15:25,444 --> 01:15:27,138
I thought she'd gone for good.

1114
01:15:27,641 --> 01:15:29,345
How utterly absurd of you, Albert.

1115
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:32,232
There has never been any
question of her not coming back.

1116
01:15:33,753 --> 01:15:35,532
Why didn't you say
so in the first place?

1117
01:15:35,748 --> 01:15:37,942
You played the fool so much
with Louisa and Emily.

1118
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:40,693
I was afraid you'd blurt it out.

1119
01:15:42,481 --> 01:15:44,355
As it is, I'll have to
break it to them gently.

1120
01:15:44,571 --> 01:15:46,477
Because it means
they will have to go too.

1121
01:15:51,855 --> 01:15:53,989
My little country holiday has
obviously come to an end.

1122
01:15:54,843 --> 01:15:56,734
I don't know what the
blazes I'll do in Canada.

1123
01:15:56,950 --> 01:15:59,119
I suppose one can starve there
as well as anywhere else.

1124
01:15:59,677 --> 01:16:00,790
You'll get on.

1125
01:16:01,757 --> 01:16:03,762
I'll give you a little
something to start off with.

1126
01:16:04,659 --> 01:16:05,908
For your mother's sake.

1127
01:16:06,405 --> 01:16:08,376
I suppose I should extend
my most humble thanks.

1128
01:16:08,668 --> 01:16:10,540
No. That from you would be too much.

1129
01:16:11,034 --> 01:16:13,664
If that's all we have to say to each
other, I may as well get up to bed.

1130
01:16:32,163 --> 01:16:34,237
A good night's sleep wouldn't
do you any harm, either.

1131
01:16:35,093 --> 01:16:36,483
You look a bit played out.

1132
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:43,698
I must lock up first.

1133
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,157
Will I be seeing you in the
morning before I leave?

1134
01:16:49,557 --> 01:16:50,486
Yes.

1135
01:16:59,735 --> 01:17:01,070
I forgot to tell you, auntie.

1136
01:17:02,138 --> 01:17:03,848
I had a funny dream last night.

1137
01:17:05,052 --> 01:17:05,796
Did you?

1138
01:17:08,636 --> 01:17:10,288
I dreamt Miss Fiske was dead.

1139
01:17:17,761 --> 01:17:20,112
Goodnight, auntie.
- Goodnight, Albert.

1140
01:18:52,767 --> 01:18:54,268
Miss Fiske ..

1141
01:19:06,554 --> 01:19:07,625
Albert.

1142
01:19:08,620 --> 01:19:09,497
Albert!

1143
01:19:48,544 --> 01:19:49,617
Good morning, Bates.

1144
01:19:49,833 --> 01:19:52,997
Miss Creed ordered me. It's about the
train, but she didn't say which one.

1145
01:19:53,823 --> 01:19:54,626
Bates.

1146
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:56,975
Cancel it. Miss Creed's
not feeling well.

1147
01:19:57,382 --> 01:19:59,134
Nothing serious I hope, sir?

1148
01:19:59,716 --> 01:20:00,845
No. Nothing serious.

1149
01:20:01,576 --> 01:20:03,714
In that case, I'd better hop along.

1150
01:20:11,215 --> 01:20:13,479
She did look ill when I
took in her early tea.

1151
01:20:13,844 --> 01:20:15,160
I wish we hadn't done it.

1152
01:20:15,376 --> 01:20:17,754
Pull yourself together.
You'll ruin everything. Go on upstairs.

1153
01:20:18,116 --> 01:20:20,071
She might have died.
- Shut up.

1154
01:20:22,419 --> 01:20:24,304
Well she didn't. And we
proved what we wanted.

1155
01:20:24,605 --> 01:20:27,046
Miss Fiske is dead and she knows it.
- I wonder when she died.

1156
01:20:27,262 --> 01:20:30,193
One more go, and I'll tell you when
and how, she died. Now, go on upstairs.

1157
01:20:32,234 --> 01:20:33,778
What did Bates want, Albert?

1158
01:20:34,469 --> 01:20:37,339
He brought the news from the outside
world. It will tickle you to death.

1159
01:20:37,669 --> 01:20:39,500
Wigs and whiskers are
coming back in again.

1160
01:20:39,795 --> 01:20:41,748
I don't think this is a
time for joking, Albert.

1161
01:20:42,024 --> 01:20:43,268
With Ellen the way she is.

1162
01:20:43,484 --> 01:20:45,673
You take this thing too seriously,
my old brussels sprout.

1163
01:20:45,906 --> 01:20:48,296
She was walking in her sleep
and had a nightmare. That's all.

1164
01:20:48,857 --> 01:20:50,738
It wasn't a nightmare, Albert.

1165
01:20:52,979 --> 01:20:56,425
Oh .. what was it then?
- She says she saw a ghost.

1166
01:20:58,326 --> 01:21:00,241
In that case, lay another
place for breakfast.

1167
01:21:01,837 --> 01:21:04,083
Do you really think
it was a ghost, Emily?

1168
01:21:04,814 --> 01:21:08,147
If it were only a nightmare,
we wouldn't have heard it too.

1169
01:21:09,095 --> 01:21:12,379
Heard what?
- The music. Miss Fiske's music.

1170
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:14,174
You know, Emily.

1171
01:21:14,512 --> 01:21:16,786
I'm sometimes afraid Miss Fiske
will get the better of Ellen.

1172
01:21:17,358 --> 01:21:20,210
I sometimes think she wants
to come back and turn us out.

1173
01:21:20,570 --> 01:21:23,299
I think Miss Fiske is here .. now.

1174
01:21:24,166 --> 01:21:27,506
Well .. what are you
two whispering about?

1175
01:21:28,354 --> 01:21:30,821
Hadn't you better go for your walk now?
- Yes, Ellen.

1176
01:21:31,124 --> 01:21:32,605
Anything you say, Ellen.

1177
01:21:46,684 --> 01:21:48,838
Do you think you're
strong enough to be up?

1178
01:21:49,303 --> 01:21:52,031
Yes, dear. I'm quite alright now.
- Hadn't you better have a doctor?

1179
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:55,336
No. A doctor couldn't do any good.

1180
01:22:01,118 --> 01:22:03,274
Why are you two standing
there like a couple of owls?

1181
01:22:04,315 --> 01:22:05,674
Emily has been frightening me.

1182
01:22:05,890 --> 01:22:07,724
You've been imagining
things, both of you.

1183
01:22:07,940 --> 01:22:09,719
Now, run along for your walk.

1184
01:22:10,194 --> 01:22:12,573
Whatever you say, Ellen. You know best.

1185
01:22:47,533 --> 01:22:48,748
Good morning, aunt Ellen.

1186
01:22:52,429 --> 01:22:53,848
We didn't expect you down today.

1187
01:22:55,144 --> 01:22:56,748
Why aren't you ready yet?

1188
01:22:57,416 --> 01:22:58,898
Bates will be here at any moment.

1189
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:01,876
Bates has been here and
gone .. I sent him away.

1190
01:23:02,599 --> 01:23:04,832
What do you mean by interfering
with my arrangements?

1191
01:23:05,087 --> 01:23:07,308
I didn't like to go and leave
you not feeling well.

1192
01:23:07,829 --> 01:23:09,585
I'm quite recovered now, thank you.

1193
01:23:10,535 --> 01:23:12,151
It was a queer turn you had last night.

1194
01:23:13,012 --> 01:23:13,913
What happened?

1195
01:23:16,155 --> 01:23:17,012
Nothing.

1196
01:23:17,529 --> 01:23:19,792
You know, you should really do
something about your nerves.

1197
01:23:20,064 --> 01:23:22,710
This isn't the first time you've walked
in your sleep, according to Emily.

1198
01:23:23,866 --> 01:23:24,996
What's Emily told you?

1199
01:23:25,212 --> 01:23:26,370
Just the usual chatter.

1200
01:23:27,566 --> 01:23:30,648
They do say that people who walk in
their sleep have a guilty conscience.

1201
01:23:32,807 --> 01:23:34,722
What's behind that remark, Albert?

1202
01:23:35,877 --> 01:23:36,788
Nothing.

1203
01:23:56,997 --> 01:23:58,016
You know.

1204
01:23:58,692 --> 01:23:59,725
Uhuh.

1205
01:24:07,734 --> 01:24:09,783
Then it was you last night?
- Yes.

1206
01:24:10,635 --> 01:24:12,786
Me and Lucy.
- She knows too?

1207
01:24:13,435 --> 01:24:16,579
Not what I know. That's something you
and I are going to keep to ourselves.

1208
01:24:17,454 --> 01:24:19,302
Provided of course, you treat me right.

1209
01:24:21,351 --> 01:24:22,852
What are you going to do?

1210
01:24:24,955 --> 01:24:26,342
As I said, I'm very happy here.

1211
01:24:26,974 --> 01:24:29,880
I think with your financial help I'll
be able to adjust things at the bank.

1212
01:24:30,486 --> 01:24:33,462
And we can all settle down in peace.
A contented little family.

1213
01:24:38,699 --> 01:24:40,639
You mean, you propose
to go on living here?

1214
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:42,511
With me?
- Why not?

1215
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:45,003
You'd never be quite sure, would you?

1216
01:24:45,991 --> 01:24:47,704
You might not enjoy your meals.

1217
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:53,741
You wouldn't dare .. a second time.

1218
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:57,031
It takes a lot of courage to
kill for the first time, Albert.

1219
01:24:57,830 --> 01:25:00,317
Once you've sold your soul to
the Devil it becomes easier.

1220
01:25:01,558 --> 01:25:02,675
Much easier.

1221
01:25:03,887 --> 01:25:07,713
Alright .. give me £500 and I'll clear
out for good. And keep my mouth shut.

1222
01:25:07,933 --> 01:25:10,215
I'm not afraid of you, Albert.
And your shabby little tricks.

1223
01:25:10,666 --> 01:25:13,323
In the middle of the night, you may
fancy yourself cutting quite a figure.

1224
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:15,595
It's broad daylight now.

1225
01:25:16,055 --> 01:25:17,426
[ Door knocks ]

1226
01:25:22,761 --> 01:25:23,944
It's those nuns.

1227
01:25:24,482 --> 01:25:27,362
Get that out of sight.
And yourself with it.

1228
01:25:31,659 --> 01:25:33,002
[ Door knocks ]

1229
01:25:38,532 --> 01:25:41,311
Good day, Sisters.
- I must talk to you, right away.

1230
01:25:41,857 --> 01:25:43,121
Are you alone?
- Yes.

1231
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:44,905
What's the matter?

1232
01:25:45,241 --> 01:25:48,898
It's really none of my business
and I shouldn't have come but ..

1233
01:25:49,781 --> 01:25:52,419
The police. They've been to the Priory.
- What about?

1234
01:25:52,973 --> 01:25:54,653
They're searching for a young man.

1235
01:25:55,095 --> 01:25:57,671
Who stole money from a
bank over Gravesend way.

1236
01:25:58,212 --> 01:26:01,295
And from the description,
I suspect it was your nephew.

1237
01:26:01,945 --> 01:26:05,639
I thought if he were told, he might
have a chance to do the right thing.

1238
01:26:06,213 --> 01:26:07,596
And give himself up.

1239
01:26:08,675 --> 01:26:10,261
It is your nephew?
- Yes.

1240
01:26:10,825 --> 01:26:14,130
But they mustn't search here.
- They've gone to the Coyne farm first.

1241
01:26:14,553 --> 01:26:16,139
I heard one of them say so.

1242
01:26:17,097 --> 01:26:20,813
Oh Miss Ellen. Have I done
wrong in coming to warn you?

1243
01:26:22,345 --> 01:26:23,773
I don't know, Sister.

1244
01:26:24,730 --> 01:26:26,719
I had a brother rather like that.

1245
01:26:27,632 --> 01:26:28,938
He went wrong too.

1246
01:26:30,148 --> 01:26:33,618
People are so easily lost, aren't they?

1247
01:26:34,524 --> 01:26:35,575
Yes they are.

1248
01:26:36,083 --> 01:26:38,511
Poor girl. You have so many burdens.

1249
01:26:39,161 --> 01:26:40,320
If you refer to Albert.

1250
01:26:40,901 --> 01:26:42,388
He means absolutely nothing to me.

1251
01:26:43,143 --> 01:26:44,543
No-one does, for that matter.

1252
01:26:45,350 --> 01:26:46,843
Except Emily and Louisa.

1253
01:26:48,365 --> 01:26:53,486
If, any time, we can do anything to make
things easier for you or your sisters ..

1254
01:26:54,242 --> 01:26:56,078
Don't hesitate to turn to us.

1255
01:26:56,401 --> 01:26:58,181
That's very kind of you, Sister Theresa.

1256
01:26:58,843 --> 01:27:00,509
But you know, we're not of your faith.

1257
01:27:01,152 --> 01:27:04,017
In my Father's house are many mansions.

1258
01:27:10,324 --> 01:27:11,797
Blimey, I thought they'd never go.

1259
01:27:12,013 --> 01:27:13,715
Thanks for putting in
a good word for me.

1260
01:27:15,247 --> 01:27:16,837
The Coyne farm, is it?

1261
01:27:17,115 --> 01:27:19,332
That will give me a chance to
get behind them to the river.

1262
01:27:19,548 --> 01:27:21,951
Hurry. There's no time to lose.
- Yes, I'll get my clothes.

1263
01:27:36,482 --> 01:27:37,496
Lucy.

1264
01:27:38,970 --> 01:27:40,574
Why are you staring at me like that?

1265
01:27:47,259 --> 01:27:48,389
You've been listening.

1266
01:27:52,279 --> 01:27:53,011
Lucy.

1267
01:27:53,847 --> 01:27:55,077
Lucy, come back.

1268
01:27:56,673 --> 01:27:57,922
Lucy, come back.

1269
01:28:00,607 --> 01:28:01,729
What's up?

1270
01:28:04,948 --> 01:28:05,763
What is it?

1271
01:28:06,671 --> 01:28:07,700
Lucy's run off.

1272
01:28:08,543 --> 01:28:09,842
She was listening.

1273
01:28:11,899 --> 01:28:13,091
Turn me in, would she?

1274
01:28:13,589 --> 01:28:15,946
I've got to move fast.
Where's that money and boat ticket?

1275
01:28:21,783 --> 01:28:23,304
You mean, she heard all about that?

1276
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:28,225
Yes.

1277
01:28:29,117 --> 01:28:31,860
Hey .. you'd better
make a dash for it too.

1278
01:28:46,271 --> 01:28:47,740
Don't stand there mooning about.

1279
01:28:48,092 --> 01:28:49,909
Put your things on and
let's get out of here.

1280
01:28:52,816 --> 01:28:53,999
I'm not going.

1281
01:28:56,844 --> 01:28:58,130
Are you out of your mind?

1282
01:29:01,266 --> 01:29:03,883
You know what they'll do to you?
- You'd better hurry, Albert.

1283
01:29:04,966 --> 01:29:06,581
Well, if that don't beat the cards.

1284
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:09,710
Well then ..

1285
01:29:11,785 --> 01:29:14,516
So long Ellen .. no hard feelings.

1286
01:29:49,217 --> 01:29:50,486
Ellen, it was so funny.

1287
01:29:50,849 --> 01:29:51,893
We just saw Albert.

1288
01:29:52,306 --> 01:29:53,808
He was playing 'tag' with some men.

1289
01:29:54,130 --> 01:29:56,069
He didn't win. They caught him.

1290
01:29:56,413 --> 01:29:57,556
He got quite annoyed.

1291
01:30:00,436 --> 01:30:02,922
Ellen, look.
We found a lot of jackdaw feathers.

1292
01:30:03,297 --> 01:30:05,846
We're going to tie them into
bundles and make little dusters.

1293
01:30:07,021 --> 01:30:08,492
Where are you going?

1294
01:30:10,172 --> 01:30:11,816
I'm going to Coyne farm.

1295
01:30:12,298 --> 01:30:14,852
There are some gentlemen there from
Gravesend and I want to see them.

1296
01:30:15,068 --> 01:30:16,974
You won't bring them
back here, will you Ellen.

1297
01:30:17,228 --> 01:30:19,134
It's so nice and peaceful by ourselves.

1298
01:30:20,007 --> 01:30:22,812
No, dear. I'll try not to
bring them back here.

1299
01:30:31,833 --> 01:30:35,636
You have been happy here, haven't you?
- We are happy here, aren't we Emily?

1300
01:30:35,852 --> 01:30:38,249
Yes .. it's much better than London.

1301
01:30:38,547 --> 01:30:40,897
It's so good of you to have
bought this house for us.

1302
01:30:41,242 --> 01:30:43,035
You have been clever, Ellen.

1303
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:07,632
How long will you be?

1304
01:31:08,778 --> 01:31:10,031
I don't know, dear.

1305
01:31:10,562 --> 01:31:12,115
Maybe quite a time.

1306
01:31:13,116 --> 01:31:15,317
I think I shall go down
to The Priory tomorrow.

1307
01:31:15,914 --> 01:31:18,728
I should like to see the things the
Reverend Mother collected on the marsh.

1308
01:31:18,965 --> 01:31:20,045
I'll go with you.

1309
01:31:26,793 --> 01:31:29,371
Goodbye, Ellen .. don't worry about us.

1310
01:31:29,816 --> 01:31:31,460
We can look after ourselves.

1311
01:32:12,774 --> 01:32:13,678
..t-g..
