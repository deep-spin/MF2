1
00:01:06,307 --> 00:01:08,842
No need for it at all.

2
00:01:09,047 --> 00:01:11,322
Reasonable foresight, that's all
that was necessary.

3
00:01:11,407 --> 00:01:14,558
We change from a primarily agricultural country
to an industrial one...

4
00:01:14,687 --> 00:01:16,643
...and within time, the colonies
fall into our hands.

5
00:01:16,767 --> 00:01:18,439
- And what do we do?
- Coffee here's worse every night.

6
00:01:18,647 --> 00:01:20,797
- Steward!
- Absolutely nothing.

7
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:23,884
We pour money down the drain, buying
our foodstuffs from all over the world...

8
00:01:24,087 --> 00:01:25,645
...instead of developing the Empire.

9
00:01:25,847 --> 00:01:29,203
Riordan, you're a doctor....this coffee
is enough to kill a man, isn't it?

10
00:01:29,447 --> 00:01:30,596
With the obvious result...

11
00:01:30,927 --> 00:01:33,157
When we have to pay for a war,
we can't pay for our food.

12
00:01:33,247 --> 00:01:35,377
- Riordan!
- Oh...sorry!

13
00:01:35,727 --> 00:01:37,922
- This coffee...shocking
- Terrible.

14
00:01:38,127 --> 00:01:39,719
- Ah...more coffee!
- Yes, sir.

15
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:42,242
Excuse me doctor...you forgot
to sign your dinner cheque.

16
00:01:42,487 --> 00:01:43,522
Oh, yes.

17
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,183
Still, things were coming along
quite nicely...

18
00:01:45,183 --> 00:01:46,365
...until Hitler popped up.

19
00:01:46,927 --> 00:01:49,316
He didn't "pop up"...
He was inevitable.

20
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,046
Well...war was, anyway.

21
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:54,000
What sort of mentality would have
precluded the possibility of war?

22
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:56,573
Anyhow, neglecting the empire started

23
00:01:56,573 --> 00:01:58,560
long before this government
got into power.

24
00:01:58,807 --> 00:02:01,037
It's no specific government I'm blaming.

25
00:02:01,247 --> 00:02:03,238
It's our complacent insularism.

26
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:04,642
- Empire!
- Allow me, sir.

27
00:02:04,727 --> 00:02:06,319
Knew a man once
who went to Australia.

28
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:09,521
Ian Pumprick...
got into some sort of trouble...

29
00:02:09,567 --> 00:02:11,319
...packed him off...
back inside a year.

30
00:02:11,927 --> 00:02:14,725
Couldn't hit it off with the Australians...
sent him to Canada.

31
00:02:15,087 --> 00:02:17,726
No idea what happened to him.
Ever met a Canadian?

32
00:02:17,807 --> 00:02:20,367
- I known Canada well.
- Fantastic lingo.

33
00:02:20,527 --> 00:02:23,246
Same as the Americans you know.
Met a Canadian once.

34
00:02:23,527 --> 00:02:25,085
Couldn't understand a word he said.

35
00:02:25,567 --> 00:02:27,080
I said, "Look here, young man..."

36
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:30,876
"...if you're going to stay in the Empire,
you'll have to learn how to speak English."

37
00:02:31,607 --> 00:02:32,642
Took it quite well.

38
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:37,037
- Good night, gentlemen.
- Good night.

39
00:02:36,947 --> 00:02:39,256
Do you realise that we're living
on American dollars, sir?

40
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:42,460
That every mouthful of food we eat,
costs dollars.

41
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:44,664
Might get some decent coffee.

42
00:02:45,107 --> 00:02:46,222
Thank you.

43
00:02:58,527 --> 00:02:59,616
Good night, sir.

44
00:03:07,307 --> 00:03:08,376
Taxi!

45
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:12,505
Diltrail House, please.

46
00:03:32,027 --> 00:03:33,096
Good night.

47
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:33,300
Oh, it's you sir!

48
00:04:35,587 --> 00:04:39,216
This is a surprise... We didn't expect you
back for a fortnight.

49
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,900
Torquay's postponed for a few days...
an urgent case came up.

50
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,617
We didn't expect you back
for a fortnight.

51
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:52,341
Torquay's postponed.

52
00:04:53,947 --> 00:04:55,346
Mrs Riordan not here, then?

53
00:04:55,907 --> 00:04:59,024
No sir.  Madam said that
she might be rather late...

54
00:04:59,147 --> 00:05:00,580
...and that I needn't wait up.

55
00:05:01,227 --> 00:05:03,024
- Shall I take your coat?
- No, don't do that.

56
00:05:04,027 --> 00:05:06,302
I'll keep it on for a moment...
It's a little chilly.

57
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:07,902
Very good, sir.

58
00:05:07,987 --> 00:05:11,821
I forget...was someone calling
for Mrs Riordan, tonight?

59
00:05:11,947 --> 00:05:15,257
No sir...Madam left the house
alone in a taxi.

60
00:05:15,747 --> 00:05:16,782
I see.

61
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,156
You may as well go back to bed, Aitken...

62
00:05:21,156 --> 00:05:23,418
I'll wait up for my wife.

63
00:05:22,987 --> 00:05:24,022
Very good, sir.

64
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:26,136
Good night, sir.

65
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,944
- Scotch?
- Thanks.

66
00:07:29,787 --> 00:07:31,459
- How about some music?
- Lovely!

67
00:07:34,627 --> 00:07:37,346
Brahms, Beethoven...

68
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:39,145
Haven't you got any civilised music
around here?

69
00:07:39,427 --> 00:07:40,940
Where's that record
I gave you last week?

70
00:07:41,307 --> 00:07:44,265
- Somewhere there.
- So it is.

71
00:07:46,827 --> 00:07:49,182
- May I have the pleasure, madam?
- I'm busy.

72
00:07:58,307 --> 00:07:59,535
There's no ice.

73
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:09,664
You silly boy!

74
00:08:09,867 --> 00:08:11,300
Look at your tie!

75
00:08:11,587 --> 00:08:12,622
Put your head up.

76
00:08:13,347 --> 00:08:15,702
Mother uses to tie it...
Did it for years.

77
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:17,941
You're still a baby.

78
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:22,859
That's why you love me...
maternal instinct coming out.

79
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:25,615
I'll fix some ice.

80
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,140
And leave me here all alone?

81
00:08:30,707 --> 00:08:33,555
Let ME get the ice...
you two carry on.

82
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:37,064
We mustn't be inhospitable
to our American cousins...must we?

83
00:08:38,187 --> 00:08:39,336
Clive!

84
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:45,461
- Hello there, Clive.
- Hello, Bill.

85
00:08:45,947 --> 00:08:47,539
- Hello.
- Bill!

86
00:08:48,707 --> 00:08:51,380
- I thought he'd gone away.
- He HAD gone!

87
00:08:51,507 --> 00:08:53,975
- Well, he's come back, I guess.
- How long has he been here?

88
00:08:54,147 --> 00:08:55,500
Quick!...think!...
Do we say anything?

89
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:57,293
I don't think so.
Did we do anything?

90
00:08:57,293 --> 00:09:00,343
No...Bill...keep your head!

91
00:08:59,827 --> 00:09:01,624
You took me to the Rechosky concert.

92
00:09:01,867 --> 00:09:03,823
- Margaret couldn't go, so I asked you.
- Who's Margaret?

93
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:06,735
- Don't worry about that. Do you understand?
- OK...OK.

94
00:09:06,827 --> 00:09:09,500
Afterwards we had some oysters at Savoy.
At The Grill.

95
00:09:09,627 --> 00:09:11,379
- We didn't dance.
- Why not?

96
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,195
For heaven's sake, don't argue.

97
00:09:13,195 --> 00:09:15,626
He doesn't like me dancing
with other men.

98
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,898
Oh, Clive...can I help?

99
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:20,904
- I see you've managed.
- Yes, I've managed...thanks all the same.

100
00:09:20,987 --> 00:09:23,137
- Why did you come back. darling?
- I changed my mind.

101
00:09:23,467 --> 00:09:25,781
"What did I want with a holiday?"...
I asked myself.

102
00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:28,565
A holiday away from
my beautiful wife!

103
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:29,852
Your drink my dear...

104
00:09:31,078 --> 00:09:32,937
And here's yours, Bill.

105
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:34,259
- Thanks.
- And here's mine.

106
00:09:38,947 --> 00:09:40,539
Do sit down...please!

107
00:09:41,827 --> 00:09:43,658
No...over there on the sofa.

108
00:09:46,187 --> 00:09:47,626
That's the idea...

109
00:09:48,425 --> 00:09:49,682
Well, good luck!

110
00:09:49,994 --> 00:09:50,716
Cheers!

111
00:09:50,751 --> 00:09:53,055
By the way...Margaret couldn't go
to the concert after all...

112
00:09:53,055 --> 00:09:53,997
...so you went.

113
00:09:54,133 --> 00:09:54,987
Yes.

114
00:09:54,987 --> 00:09:58,696
Bill rang about something or other,
just after Margaret rang, so...

115
00:09:59,147 --> 00:10:00,505
So I got me a free seat.

116
00:10:00,505 --> 00:10:02,023
Did you enjoy the concert?

117
00:10:02,058 --> 00:10:04,066
- Oh, swell!
- He played everything I love.

118
00:10:04,066 --> 00:10:06,177
- Many there?
- Overflowing.

119
00:10:06,307 --> 00:10:08,343
- They were standing at the back.
- Remarkable!

120
00:10:08,587 --> 00:10:10,782
So you saw the house
full to overflowing.

121
00:10:11,187 --> 00:10:13,781
- Sure, what of it?
- Really remarkable.

122
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:18,345
And you my dear heard your favorite music
...played...interpreted by Rechosky.

123
00:10:18,907 --> 00:10:20,386
Some of it, yes.

124
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:25,542
Really remarkable imagination.
Such is the power of the master musician.

125
00:10:26,347 --> 00:10:27,826
Even if he isn't there.

126
00:10:29,267 --> 00:10:32,225
You see, there was no concert tonight.
It was cancelled.

127
00:10:32,987 --> 00:10:34,918
Rechosky was taken to
a nursing home...

128
00:10:34,918 --> 00:10:38,061
...half an hour before the performance
was due to begin.

129
00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:50,705
The thing is, I too am sitting here
wondering what I'd say...

130
00:10:50,705 --> 00:10:52,199
...in either of your positions.

131
00:10:52,507 --> 00:10:54,418
But no, I can't think of anything either.

132
00:10:55,507 --> 00:10:56,542
Bill, please go.

133
00:10:56,627 --> 00:10:58,936
- Yes, I guess if you'll pardon...
-Good night, Bill!

134
00:10:59,907 --> 00:11:02,740
Good night, Storm.
I don't know what to say.

135
00:11:03,547 --> 00:11:04,870
But I know what to say...

136
00:11:05,618 --> 00:11:06,398
Sit down.

137
00:11:06,398 --> 00:11:08,299
Put that gun away at once!

138
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:10,903
Sit down...both of you.

139
00:11:23,507 --> 00:11:24,319
Well, Bill?

140
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:29,427
You're right, Clive...
we didn't go to the concert.

141
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,297
We went to The Savoy...
for a bite to eat.

142
00:11:33,467 --> 00:11:35,423
The Grill.
We didn't dance.

143
00:11:35,587 --> 00:11:37,051
I was starving as usual.

144
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:39,264
You know the way she gets.

145
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:41,138
Yes...I know the way she gets.

146
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:43,732
I'm afraid it's all my fault...

147
00:11:43,732 --> 00:11:46,102
I persuaded Storm
to skip the concert.

148
00:11:47,187 --> 00:11:50,259
Savoy? The Grill, please...
I'd like to speak to Tony.

149
00:11:51,307 --> 00:11:54,379
Bill, you will now see
British diplomacy at its best.

150
00:11:55,747 --> 00:11:57,465
They must be busy...
listen to the bar.

151
00:12:00,307 --> 00:12:03,982
Is that you Tony? Good evening,
this is Dr Clive Riordan.

152
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:06,217
How are you?...
Fine thanks.

153
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:09,576
I've finished a case
a little earlier than I expected...

154
00:12:09,987 --> 00:12:12,455
...and I told my wife I'd try
and join her later if I could...

155
00:12:13,147 --> 00:12:15,581
...but I very stupidly forgot
where she said she was going.

156
00:12:16,427 --> 00:12:18,019
Is she in The Grill, by any chance?

157
00:12:18,347 --> 00:12:23,625
She'd be with that nice young American...
Mr Kronin...Mr Bill Kronin.

158
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:27,703
No? Have they been there tonight?

159
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:31,102
Not?  Well, I'll try somewhere else.

160
00:12:31,907 --> 00:12:33,545
Thanks so much...goodbye.

161
00:12:34,507 --> 00:12:36,816
Tony sends his regards
to you my dear.

162
00:12:37,747 --> 00:12:39,013
Well, Bill...how was that?

163
00:12:39,013 --> 00:12:41,388
Oh, for heaven's sake,
stop this ridiculous nonsense!

164
00:12:41,947 --> 00:12:45,462
I'm going to bed. Good  night Bill...
I'll see you to the door.

165
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:47,536
Good night, Clive.

166
00:12:54,627 --> 00:12:55,776
On the sofa.

167
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:14,819
A little putty and a touch of paint
and you'll never notice it.

168
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:21,184
So you were not at the concert
and you were not at The Savoy.

169
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:25,063
Let's cut it short Clive.
I feel like an awful heel.

170
00:13:25,267 --> 00:13:27,064
I should have come to you
in the first place, I know....

171
00:13:27,187 --> 00:13:29,223
Bill, don't say anything...
Anything!  Do you understand?

172
00:13:29,387 --> 00:13:31,459
- Let's get it over with, darling.
- Shut up!

173
00:13:33,587 --> 00:13:36,055
Now who could you be telephoning
at this hour?

174
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:47,383
Hello, Betty...
Hello darling, Storm here.

175
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,195
I knew you'd still be up.

176
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,821
Well, I saw you,
but you didn't see me.

177
00:13:53,587 --> 00:13:54,940
At the concert.

178
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:58,479
Well, we were a good way back.

179
00:13:59,845 --> 00:14:01,530
I never heard the orchestra
in better form.

180
00:14:02,387 --> 00:14:04,105
Wasn't Rechosky terrific?

181
00:14:07,387 --> 00:14:09,021
Darling, how about lunch on Thursday?

182
00:14:09,021 --> 00:14:12,506
Alright I'll ring you Thursday morning
for arrangements.

183
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:12,736
Goodbye.

184
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:14,905
Very clever my dear...
but too late.

185
00:14:15,747 --> 00:14:17,385
I'm sorry you had
to find out tonight.

186
00:14:17,747 --> 00:14:20,215
I was so looking forward to you
opening "The Times" in the morning

187
00:14:20,307 --> 00:14:22,025
...and seeing the criticism
of the concert.

188
00:14:23,307 --> 00:14:26,777
Do sit down, please...then I won't have to
keep turning my head.

189
00:14:31,627 --> 00:14:33,777
Well now, to sum up the situation...

190
00:14:34,427 --> 00:14:37,875
You, Bill, want to tell me something
that I know already...and...

191
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:39,301
...you Storm, won't let him.

192
00:14:40,107 --> 00:14:41,354
Nobody knows what to do.

193
00:14:41,354 --> 00:14:42,841
Nobody, that is, except me.

194
00:14:43,045 --> 00:14:46,025
I knew what I was going to do yesterday...
and the day before that...

195
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:49,741
And every day, right back
to the first time you both met.

196
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:52,134
At that cocktail party...remember?

197
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:56,523
I saw you and Storm
laughing and chatting together.

198
00:14:56,947 --> 00:15:00,860
...and to my long-experienced eye,
flashed the familiar message...

199
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:05,301
Storm is under full sail again...
the calm has lifted.

200
00:15:05,747 --> 00:15:10,987
You see, I decided what to do with the next one...
before you even met my wife.

201
00:15:11,387 --> 00:15:13,423
And you, Bill, are "the next one".

202
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:18,246
I know exactly what I'm going to do.

203
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:20,681
I'm going to kill you.

204
00:15:21,227 --> 00:15:23,058
- Now, wait a minute, Clive!
- Don't be a fool!

205
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:27,984
He's not a fool...he's not going to
shoot me like this in cold blood.

206
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:29,546
Don't you be so sure.

207
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:44,063
Tell me..are you interested in thrillers
and murder stories?

208
00:15:44,227 --> 00:15:45,421
I was until now.

209
00:15:46,507 --> 00:15:49,465
You know it's a pity I've got to kill you,
because I really quite like you.

210
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:51,691
Get out.

211
00:15:51,691 --> 00:15:53,720
Alright, Storm, give me the gun
and let's call it a day.

212
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:54,470
Bill, keep out of this please.

213
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:55,804
Well, what are you going to do...

214
00:15:55,804 --> 00:15:56,833
Are you going to shoot me?

215
00:15:56,868 --> 00:15:57,940
- Get back!
- Storm...darling!

216
00:15:57,987 --> 00:15:59,930
That's one way to avoid a scandal...
shut up!

217
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:01,576
That first cocktail party...
Was it worth it?

218
00:16:01,576 --> 00:16:02,864
And don't try to be funny.

219
00:16:02,864 --> 00:16:04,756
I know exactly how you're feeling,
my dear.

220
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:07,730
Your pride is hurt...you've been made
to look a fool in front of Bill...

221
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:10,540
..and you're dying to shoot me,
aren't you?

222
00:16:11,347 --> 00:16:13,630
- Well, why don't you pull the trigger?
- Don't come near me!

223
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:17,257
Well I'm only trying to help you...
I'm sure this'll do the trick.

224
00:16:26,107 --> 00:16:28,018
I took these out while I was looking
at the bullet hole.

225
00:16:43,267 --> 00:16:47,385
I knew there was only one way to make a woman
withdraw permanently from a situation like this.

226
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:49,220
A direct humiliation.

227
00:16:51,907 --> 00:16:55,104
And now we're alone together
which is exactly what I'd planned.

228
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:56,985
- You'd planned?
- Of course.

229
00:16:57,707 --> 00:16:59,049
- You figured all this out?

230
00:16:59,049 --> 00:17:01,229
Weeks ago...it's part of
my perfect murder.

231
00:17:02,027 --> 00:17:04,182
You see Storm mustn't see us
go out together.

232
00:17:04,182 --> 00:17:07,146
That's why I had to get rid of her.

233
00:17:10,107 --> 00:17:13,861
Clive!  I hope you notice
I still call you Clive.

234
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,136
Yes, Bill.

235
00:17:15,907 --> 00:17:17,784
You're not really serious!...

236
00:17:18,187 --> 00:17:21,820
You're not going to take a harmless
little flirtation seriously, are you?

237
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:22,516
Oh, but that's the trouble you see...

238
00:17:22,516 --> 00:17:24,789
There have been so many
harmless little flirtations.

239
00:17:25,347 --> 00:17:28,942
You've heard of "the last straw",
haven't you, Bill?

240
00:17:29,587 --> 00:17:30,702
Well, you're it.

241
00:17:31,587 --> 00:17:34,818
But you're kidding...all this nonsense
about "a perfect murder".

242
00:17:34,907 --> 00:17:37,944
I'm afraid not.
Would you care for "one for the road"?

243
00:17:38,587 --> 00:17:43,581
No thanks.  You mean
we're "going places".

244
00:17:43,582 --> 00:17:44,582
Yes, Bill...we're "going places".

245
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:06,058
Work it out for yourself,
my dear fellow...

246
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:09,862
10 million Empire acres
on which we spend a pound per acre...

247
00:18:09,947 --> 00:18:12,825
A pound sterling, mind you...
10 million sterling.

248
00:18:13,942 --> 00:18:15,018
Call that whisky?

249
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:19,685
That's all...10 million pounds yielding
a permanent increase in our food supply...

250
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,727
as opposed to paying interest,
down the drain, mind you...

251
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,946
on American loans going to buy
Argentine wheat...

252
00:18:24,946 --> 00:18:25,301
...am I wrong?

253
00:18:25,427 --> 00:18:26,985
Something wrong with
the whisky nowadays.

254
00:18:27,187 --> 00:18:30,418
- But that would take some considerable time...
- Whisky, you're so right, sir.

255
00:18:30,507 --> 00:18:34,500
That's another example that proves my point...
It's dollars all the time, sir.

256
00:18:34,587 --> 00:18:36,416
A stranglehold on The Empire.

257
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:39,019
I seem to have read somewhere
that America lent us some dollars.

258
00:18:39,227 --> 00:18:42,424
Well, there you are...there's no excuse
for this rotten whisky.

259
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:45,177
- Extraordinary business here.
- What?

260
00:18:45,747 --> 00:18:47,977
Still no news of that American fellow.

261
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:50,940
"Kronin mystery deepens...
five days missing."

262
00:18:51,627 --> 00:18:54,141
- No clues at all.
- There you are again, you see.

263
00:18:54,307 --> 00:18:57,678
We've only got to pick up a London newspaper...
one of our own newspapers...

264
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,142
And what do we read about...
Americans, Americans, Americans.

265
00:19:00,142 --> 00:19:01,950
Lot of fuss about nothing.

266
00:19:01,985 --> 00:19:03,345
It's obvious to me
what's happened to him.

267
00:19:03,587 --> 00:19:05,578
What's your theory, Colonel?

268
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:10,346
It's something to do with this
atomic invention of theirs.

269
00:19:10,347 --> 00:19:11,347
The Russians have got him.

270
00:19:11,307 --> 00:19:14,145
If you'll excuse me I must be
getting back to  Whitehall.

271
00:19:14,467 --> 00:19:16,298
Yes, and even doctors must work.

272
00:19:18,827 --> 00:19:21,530
I hope I haven't given you
a wrong impression of him, Doctor?

273
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:24,301
He's a perfectly normal husband
in other respects...

274
00:19:24,627 --> 00:19:28,256
...but this thing...it really seems
to have got hold of his mind.

275
00:19:28,907 --> 00:19:30,863
I didn't mind the Saturday afternoons...

276
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:32,659
...or even Sunday mornings...

277
00:19:32,787 --> 00:19:35,938
...every night after his office.

278
00:19:36,547 --> 00:19:37,662
It's too much.

279
00:19:38,547 --> 00:19:42,699
There he goes, with that ridiculous little boat,
straight to round pond in Kensington Gardens.

280
00:19:43,387 --> 00:19:47,239
And he just plays...and plays and plays.

281
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:49,423
Well Mrs Humphries,
from what you've told me...

282
00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:52,857
...I shouldn't say there's anything abnormal
about your husband's behaviour.

283
00:19:56,307 --> 00:19:57,307
Be quiet, Monty.

284
00:19:57,707 --> 00:20:00,064
The last patient's with the doctor now,
Mrs Riordan.

285
00:20:00,064 --> 00:20:02,701
Thank you...I'll wait a bit.

286
00:20:05,107 --> 00:20:07,074
I can never thank you enough, doctor.

287
00:20:07,547 --> 00:20:09,883
As you say, it might have been worse.

288
00:20:09,883 --> 00:20:11,677
It could have been kites.

289
00:20:12,947 --> 00:20:15,939
Hello, Monty.
He won't hurt you.

290
00:20:16,267 --> 00:20:18,701
You're a wicked naughty dog.
I'll take him.

291
00:20:20,867 --> 00:20:22,884
Good afternoon, Mrs Humphries.

292
00:20:22,884 --> 00:20:26,370
Good afternoon, doctor...
thank you again.

293
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,300
Pleasure,

294
00:20:30,627 --> 00:20:32,777
No more patients tonight, doctor.

295
00:20:32,514 --> 00:20:33,778
That's splendid...
Well, you can go, Miss Stevens.

296
00:20:38,667 --> 00:20:40,385
Well, my dear...
What brings you down here?

297
00:20:40,987 --> 00:20:42,625
- Can I have some money, please?
- How much?

298
00:20:42,987 --> 00:20:45,296
10 pounds...I lost it to Marge at bridge.

299
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:47,342
Do you want a lift home?

300
00:20:47,342 --> 00:20:49,738
No thanks, she's outside
with her car.

301
00:20:49,587 --> 00:20:52,101
By the way, I've had a letter
from Bill Kronin.

302
00:20:59,107 --> 00:21:02,179
- So you've had a letter from Bill Kronin?
- Yes.

303
00:21:02,547 --> 00:21:04,458
- When was this?
- Just before lunch.

304
00:21:04,507 --> 00:21:06,782
- So he's alive, then?
- Naturally.

305
00:21:06,867 --> 00:21:09,335
- Where is he?
- He doesn't want you to know.

306
00:21:10,147 --> 00:21:12,980
- May I see the letter?
- I burnt it.

307
00:21:13,947 --> 00:21:16,063
Well, it's nice to know
that he's turned up again.

308
00:21:17,547 --> 00:21:18,582
Isn't it!

309
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:24,420
Let's see...it must be 5 days
since I scared the daylights out of him.

310
00:21:25,227 --> 00:21:27,377
Frankly, though, I didn't think
you'd hear from him again.

311
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:30,585
You surely didn't think your
petty jealousy would put Bill off?

312
00:21:31,027 --> 00:21:32,096
Yes.

313
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:34,152
I wish I hadn't burnt that letter...

314
00:21:34,152 --> 00:21:37,257
Then you could have read
what I read.

315
00:21:36,747 --> 00:21:38,236
Go on...I won't tell anyone.

316
00:21:38,236 --> 00:21:40,881
Bill's waiting for me...
do you hear?

317
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:44,582
Bill's waiting for me.  He loves me...
and wants me to divorce you.

318
00:21:45,227 --> 00:21:48,060
He's waiting for you...and loves me
as you've never loved me.

319
00:21:49,387 --> 00:21:51,025
When are you off, my dear?

320
00:21:52,787 --> 00:21:55,869
Oh, by the way...
What did Scotland Yard say?

321
00:21:55,869 --> 00:21:57,300
Scotland Yard?

322
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,702
Yes, weren't they pleased?
You surely told them of your letter.

323
00:22:01,147 --> 00:22:02,262
Why should I?

324
00:22:02,427 --> 00:22:05,197
My dear, the army spent
the most strenuous few days

325
00:22:05,197 --> 00:22:07,785
...searching high and low
for Bill Kronin.

326
00:22:07,187 --> 00:22:08,222
Dead or alive.

327
00:22:08,747 --> 00:22:11,932
The police on the Continent and in the States,
are still searching for him.

328
00:22:12,427 --> 00:22:15,913
And you know where he is...
But you must tell them at once!

329
00:22:15,987 --> 00:22:17,311
It was a private letter.

330
00:22:17,311 --> 00:22:20,388
Now...just a minute...
I come into this too, you know.

331
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:21,865
- You?
- Of course.

332
00:22:22,347 --> 00:22:23,753
Since you told me about the letter...

333
00:22:23,753 --> 00:22:26,142
...I'd be an accessory if I kept
the knowledge to myself.

334
00:22:26,142 --> 00:22:28,336
...and there's a most awful penalty
for that.

335
00:22:28,587 --> 00:22:32,500
Hundreds of pounds, or jail or something.
My course is plain.

336
00:22:33,427 --> 00:22:35,622
- Who are you phoning?
- Scotland Yard.

337
00:22:35,827 --> 00:22:36,942
Put that down!

338
00:22:38,977 --> 00:22:39,977
Put that down!

339
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:46,026
So...he's waiting for you...and...

340
00:22:46,026 --> 00:22:48,342
He loves you as I
have never loved you.

341
00:22:49,187 --> 00:22:50,536
Well, well.

342
00:22:50,949 --> 00:22:52,430
I hate you.

343
00:27:04,587 --> 00:27:07,784
- Bless you!
- Thanks, friend.

344
00:27:09,187 --> 00:27:11,559
Well, I see I still make the front page.

345
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:13,415
Yes, Bill, I've made you famous.

346
00:27:14,027 --> 00:27:15,102
Thanks, pal.

347
00:27:16,427 --> 00:27:19,651
Yard investigates
loss of memory theory.

348
00:27:20,827 --> 00:27:22,943
It appears I've complained
of headaches recently.

349
00:27:23,147 --> 00:27:24,626
Yes, that was my scotch.

350
00:27:27,307 --> 00:27:30,379
And I have no enemies...
...it says here.

351
00:27:39,227 --> 00:27:41,582
I don't mean to appear too inquisitive...

352
00:27:41,582 --> 00:27:44,155
But would you mind telling me
what's in that room?

353
00:27:44,387 --> 00:27:45,614
Just a sort of bath.

354
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:48,139
But I have a bath, back in there.

355
00:27:48,147 --> 00:27:49,899
Yes, this another sort of bath.

356
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:53,260
This is not going to be another
"Brides in the Bath" case, I hope.

357
00:27:53,667 --> 00:27:54,991
I'm no bride, you know.

358
00:27:56,154 --> 00:27:58,749
You know, I can quite see
what Storm liked about you.

359
00:27:58,749 --> 00:28:01,725
- How is Storm?
- Fine, just fine.

360
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,065
By the way,
she's had a letter from you.

361
00:28:04,347 --> 00:28:07,373
She has?....
That's darned clever of her.

362
00:28:07,373 --> 00:28:09,881
Yes, was, wasn't it....
Hungry?

363
00:28:09,881 --> 00:28:11,532
Yes, I could eat.

364
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:22,279
How did you sleep?

365
00:28:21,976 --> 00:28:25,779
Okay, considering the cold.  How about
something warmer to wear?

366
00:28:25,779 --> 00:28:27,275
I'll get you something.

367
00:28:27,275 --> 00:28:30,050
- Everything alright in the bathroom?
- Sure.

368
00:28:30,307 --> 00:28:32,289
Care to make a personal inspection?

369
00:28:33,827 --> 00:28:35,021
Some other time.

370
00:28:38,187 --> 00:28:39,721
I'm sorry there's no hot water.

371
00:28:39,721 --> 00:28:41,396
Oh, don't apologise, old man.

372
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:47,022
It's nice of you to worry about hot water...
how things are in the bathroom...

373
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:50,808
...How do I sleep?...
You're too, too kind.

374
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:55,616
Still...and I don't want you
to think I'm ungrateful...but...

375
00:28:56,667 --> 00:29:00,061
There are one or two more important things
that I'd like to get cleared up.

376
00:29:00,587 --> 00:29:03,340
Such as "where am I?"...
"what am I doing here?"

377
00:29:04,387 --> 00:29:07,106
How much longer do you expect a man
to eat this garbage?

378
00:29:07,867 --> 00:29:12,275
I'm sorry about the food, I really am...
but it's really difficult for me.

379
00:29:12,747 --> 00:29:15,944
Difficult for you?
Look, a gag's a gag.

380
00:29:16,307 --> 00:29:20,266
You scared me...
Is that the general idea?

381
00:29:20,627 --> 00:29:23,441
I'm sorry about Storm,
I won't take her to dinner any more.

382
00:29:23,441 --> 00:29:25,066
And now, can I please go home?

383
00:29:25,787 --> 00:29:29,545
You don't seem to realise, there's more in this
than me just trying to scare you...

384
00:29:29,545 --> 00:29:30,649
...or your being sorry.

385
00:29:30,777 --> 00:29:36,016
A sensible and civilised husband doesn't object
to other men admiring his wife...

386
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:39,101
...he can even understand her
returning the admiration.

387
00:29:39,747 --> 00:29:42,944
But when this mutual attraction
becomes a habit...

388
00:29:43,467 --> 00:29:46,504
...and it's flaunted repeatedly
under his very nose...

389
00:29:46,907 --> 00:29:50,104
...under the impudent assumption
that he's being deceived...

390
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:56,869
Why, then, the intelligent and sensible
and civilised husband...is insulted

391
00:29:56,904 --> 00:30:01,356
...and he's reduced to the most insensible,
and uncivilised behaviour.

392
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:05,942
So you see...through you,
I'm going to make my wife suffer

393
00:30:06,147 --> 00:30:08,829
...for a long list of calculated insults.

394
00:30:09,865 --> 00:30:12,228
Yes, I'm going to kill you, Kronin.

395
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:12,978
By boring me to death.

396
00:30:13,467 --> 00:30:15,776
And my wife's going to suspect I killed you.

397
00:30:15,987 --> 00:30:17,545
Se may even be certain of it.

398
00:30:17,827 --> 00:30:19,297
But she'll never be able to prove it.

399
00:30:19,297 --> 00:30:21,611
You're breaking my heart, Clive.

400
00:30:23,147 --> 00:30:25,900
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Hey, wait a minute.

401
00:30:26,307 --> 00:30:28,343
Aren't you going to explain some more
about what I'm doing here?

402
00:30:28,547 --> 00:30:31,201
No, see if you can work it out
for yourself.

403
00:30:31,947 --> 00:30:34,905
Why I'm keeping you a prisoner,
instead of killing you right away.

404
00:30:35,587 --> 00:30:36,656
I did.

405
00:30:38,027 --> 00:30:39,858
It'll help you to pass the time.

406
00:30:41,787 --> 00:30:43,982
Good night Bill...
sleep well.

407
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,022
Clive!

408
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:34,302
Clive!

409
00:31:34,616 --> 00:31:35,646
Hello, my dear.

410
00:31:36,827 --> 00:31:38,818
I want to talk to you
about that letter.

411
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:39,819
Letter?

412
00:31:40,427 --> 00:31:41,884
That letter from Bill Kronin.

413
00:31:42,907 --> 00:31:44,176
Oh, that letter.

414
00:31:44,907 --> 00:31:46,431
You knew there couldn't be a letter.

415
00:31:47,213 --> 00:31:48,829
Or any letter.

416
00:31:48,829 --> 00:31:50,777
Because you've killed him,
haven't you?

417
00:31:51,347 --> 00:31:53,622
You killed him that night I left you
alone together in the lounge.

418
00:31:54,627 --> 00:31:59,041
So, you see, I have no alternative but
to tell all I know to Scotland Yard.

419
00:31:59,947 --> 00:32:02,256
My dear Storm, whether you believe
Bill is alive or dead...

420
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:04,776
in Mexico City, or whether I killed him...

421
00:32:05,107 --> 00:32:07,826
One thing is quite certain...
you won't go to Scotland Yard.

422
00:32:08,907 --> 00:32:09,795
Why not?

423
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:11,220
You know that any investigation...

424
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,888
into my relationship with Bill Kronin...

425
00:32:12,888 --> 00:32:16,100
...will inevitably uncover
your own indiscretions.

426
00:32:16,707 --> 00:32:19,699
And as you love your reputation
more than your sense of duty...

427
00:32:20,467 --> 00:32:22,935
...you won't jeopardise it
by going to Scotland Yard.

428
00:32:28,267 --> 00:32:29,575
You're quite sure of that?

429
00:32:29,575 --> 00:32:32,544
I've never been more certain
of anything.

430
00:32:36,627 --> 00:32:38,219
Help!

431
00:33:18,147 --> 00:33:20,342
I suppose you think I've gone nuts,
eh Joe?

432
00:33:20,947 --> 00:33:25,065
Well I haven't...I might
if you'd learn how to talk.

433
00:33:59,267 --> 00:34:00,462
You'll hurt yourself.

434
00:34:05,187 --> 00:34:07,781
- I've brought you a Martini.
- Dry?

435
00:34:07,907 --> 00:34:11,217
Very...and ice...
They're in the white flask.

436
00:34:11,827 --> 00:34:12,708
Much obliged.

437
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:16,974
And a chicken.

438
00:34:18,627 --> 00:34:22,017
And the indigestion tablets
you asked for.

439
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:23,736
Too, too kind!

440
00:34:28,787 --> 00:34:30,061
And the paper.

441
00:34:32,867 --> 00:34:34,346
Looks like we're in
for a hard winter.

442
00:34:36,027 --> 00:34:39,207
- Where am I?
- Page 4, bottom of column 6.

443
00:34:39,387 --> 00:34:42,060
- Slipping!
- You're just a 9-days wonder.

444
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:44,025
26 to be exact.

445
00:34:46,787 --> 00:34:48,106
Oh...dear, dear!

446
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:52,821
I see the tall dark mysterious stranger
with an American accent in Wigan...

447
00:34:53,027 --> 00:34:55,860
...came to nothing.

448
00:34:55,861 --> 00:34:56,861
Too bad.

449
00:34:56,507 --> 00:34:57,760
Thought they had something there.

450
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,038
How about books
to pass the time?

451
00:35:00,347 --> 00:35:02,736
- Sure.
- Anything in particular you'd like?

452
00:35:03,587 --> 00:35:04,940
Well, it depends.

453
00:35:05,827 --> 00:35:08,136
If I had a broken leg,
how long would it take to mend?

454
00:35:08,387 --> 00:35:10,290
About 6 weeks, why?

455
00:35:11,467 --> 00:35:14,061
Well I heard that one of the greatest
delights in life, is to break your leg...

456
00:35:14,187 --> 00:35:18,146
...and read Boswell's "Life of Samuel Johnson"
in bed.

457
00:35:18,587 --> 00:35:20,165
How about it...have I got 6 weeks?

458
00:35:21,163 --> 00:35:24,059
I'll bring you the first volume tomorrow.

459
00:35:24,547 --> 00:35:26,265
Wait a minute...you're not
going to leave yet, are you?

460
00:35:26,907 --> 00:35:29,501
Can't you stick around a little while, and talk?

461
00:35:31,867 --> 00:35:33,061
It gets kind lonesome.

462
00:35:33,947 --> 00:35:36,097
Oh, alright...just for a few minutes.

463
00:35:36,587 --> 00:35:38,179
I must stick to my timetable.

464
00:35:39,747 --> 00:35:40,862
What shall we talk about?

465
00:35:43,027 --> 00:35:44,380
War of nerves.

466
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:48,506
- Politics?
- No, this war of nerves.

467
00:35:48,547 --> 00:35:49,662
You....me!

468
00:35:52,307 --> 00:35:55,219
That perfect murder plan of yours...
I've got it all figured out.

469
00:35:55,327 --> 00:35:56,327
You have?

470
00:35:59,267 --> 00:36:00,302
You haven't got one.

471
00:36:01,347 --> 00:36:02,939
Maybe, one day, you thought you had one.

472
00:36:03,507 --> 00:36:06,021
But now you've gotten here...
it doesn't look so good.

473
00:36:06,627 --> 00:36:09,266
So you're stuck with me.

474
00:36:09,947 --> 00:36:11,096
You'll go ahead and kill me, anyhow?

475
00:36:11,707 --> 00:36:13,743
No, you're too smart.

476
00:36:14,347 --> 00:36:16,622
You switch....and you hope
I won't notice.

477
00:36:17,707 --> 00:36:20,346
The "Cold War"...the war of nerves...
that's what you switch to.

478
00:36:22,027 --> 00:36:23,540
The mysterious hot water bottles...

479
00:36:24,067 --> 00:36:26,900
the dark room with the green light
...the rubber gloves...the works!

480
00:36:28,187 --> 00:36:31,020
Very nicely staged, Clive...
but it won't work.

481
00:36:31,547 --> 00:36:34,380
Oh, no...I've been through all that before...
...at college.

482
00:36:34,827 --> 00:36:36,083
Only we do it much better.

483
00:36:36,381 --> 00:36:37,984
Kill me, Clive?

484
00:36:39,193 --> 00:36:40,738
You can't even get off the ground.

485
00:36:40,738 --> 00:36:41,991
Don't you kid yourself.

486
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,989
The way I'm going to kill you
is immaterial.

487
00:36:44,989 --> 00:36:49,387
And the manner in which I dispose of your body,
presents no obstacles.

488
00:36:49,422 --> 00:36:50,165
Keep whistling.

489
00:36:50,165 --> 00:36:51,708
My plan is roughly this...

490
00:36:51,871 --> 00:36:55,617
I've taken out an insurance policy
against being hanged.

491
00:36:56,267 --> 00:36:59,020
The premium being your captivity here
for a few months.

492
00:36:59,787 --> 00:37:01,828
You're missing...there's been
a hue and cry for you.

493
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:04,537
But so far, I haven't come
into the matter at all.

494
00:37:04,947 --> 00:37:08,144
But supposing, unbeknown to me,
I am suspect?

495
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:11,340
Supposing even now, they're building up
a case against me...

496
00:37:11,827 --> 00:37:15,376
...and one day they find that I'm responsible
for your disappearance...

497
00:37:16,027 --> 00:37:19,064
You see at once how awkward it would be
if I had already murdered you.

498
00:37:19,507 --> 00:37:20,906
Doesn't bear thinking about.

499
00:37:20,987 --> 00:37:22,818
In theory, you're as good as dead.

500
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:26,977
But should the necessity arise,
you can be produced alive, at any moment.

501
00:37:27,987 --> 00:37:30,785
And now, Bill..
and this is most important...

502
00:37:31,587 --> 00:37:34,624
Your transition from the living state
to the dead...

503
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:40,143
...won't add any further clues to those
surrounding the mystery of your disappearance.

504
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:43,377
Oh, I congratulate you, Clive...

505
00:37:44,327 --> 00:37:45,940
I really want to hand it to you.

506
00:37:46,527 --> 00:37:47,536
Thank you.

507
00:37:48,827 --> 00:37:52,878
Oh, no!...
Do you like my plan?

508
00:37:52,878 --> 00:37:55,626
Yes...not bad.
Not at all bad.

509
00:37:55,626 --> 00:38:00,426
I suppose I can learn "Boswell's Life of Johnson"
by heart then...

510
00:38:00,587 --> 00:38:01,906
...for all the good it'll do me.

511
00:38:01,987 --> 00:38:04,182
Yes, I mustn't forget
the first volume tomorrow.

512
00:38:04,626 --> 00:38:05,646
Thanks, Pal.

513
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,380
Clive, just one little thing....

514
00:38:08,947 --> 00:38:12,462
When it comes down to it...
you won't kill me.

515
00:38:13,587 --> 00:38:14,622
You're not the type.

516
00:38:15,107 --> 00:38:16,620
You hang on to that, Bill.

517
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:26,979
- Good night, Miss Stevens.
- Good night, Doctor.

518
00:38:45,627 --> 00:38:47,583
Monty, come here!

519
00:38:48,307 --> 00:38:49,342
Monty, come here!

520
00:38:52,267 --> 00:38:53,302
Monty!

521
00:39:16,707 --> 00:39:18,265
Monty, come here!

522
00:39:41,457 --> 00:39:42,467
Monty, where are you?

523
00:40:06,427 --> 00:40:07,826
Monty, where are you?

524
00:40:15,587 --> 00:40:19,136
That was smart work, Monty...
You're a clever little dog, aren't you.

525
00:40:29,867 --> 00:40:31,141
Monty!

526
00:40:31,907 --> 00:40:35,024
You old son-of-a-gun!
What a surprise!

527
00:40:35,147 --> 00:40:37,749
Come here, Monty...come on boy!
Come on!

528
00:40:45,747 --> 00:40:49,740
Nice old fellow...you've come
to visit old Montecristo, eh pal?

529
00:40:50,667 --> 00:40:54,824
- Miss Stevens, have you seen Monty?
- No, Monty hasn't been here.

530
00:40:55,067 --> 00:40:57,979
- Is my husband still working?
- No, he left about five minutes ago.

531
00:40:58,347 --> 00:41:01,541
5 minutes! Did he have a car here,
do you know...or in the garage?

532
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:05,216
- I really couldn't say.
- Thank you Miss Stevens.

533
00:41:05,307 --> 00:41:08,133
Good night.

534
00:41:11,307 --> 00:41:13,267
Good old Monty...good dog!

535
00:41:13,467 --> 00:41:15,105
Clive, you couldn't have brought me
a nicer present.

536
00:41:15,147 --> 00:41:17,217
I haven't talked to a human being
in 4 months.

537
00:41:17,347 --> 00:41:18,462
Thanks, pal!

538
00:41:21,267 --> 00:41:23,223
Monty, what goes on
in that room, eh?

539
00:41:23,787 --> 00:41:26,096
Go see what's happening...
come back and tell me...go on!

540
00:41:26,627 --> 00:41:27,662
Go!

541
00:41:29,827 --> 00:41:32,819
Hello Monty...You're going to be
quite a problem.

542
00:41:33,267 --> 00:41:36,304
Come, Monty...
Come on!

543
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,247
That's a good boy!

544
00:41:39,347 --> 00:41:41,815
What's it all about in there?
What did you see?

545
00:41:43,947 --> 00:41:45,778
Will you leave Monty with me, Clive?

546
00:41:47,587 --> 00:41:49,005
Oh, you're not leaving already?

547
00:41:49,005 --> 00:41:51,532
We've got a lot to talk over,
haven't we, old man.

548
00:41:51,547 --> 00:41:55,335
As a matter of fact, I've got half an hour
to fill in before I'm sure the coast is clear.

549
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:59,337
- Coast is clear?
- Usually outside, well, Bill.

550
00:41:59,747 --> 00:42:02,022
Storm nearly followed me here...
thanks to him.

551
00:42:02,867 --> 00:42:05,097
Good boy!
Better luck next time!

552
00:42:05,267 --> 00:42:08,623
I see you've nearly finished Boswell...
would you like something else?

553
00:42:08,707 --> 00:42:11,983
How about a Spanish dictionary
and grammar?

554
00:42:12,227 --> 00:42:15,981
I've always wanted to learn Spanish...
this seems as good a time as any.

555
00:42:16,827 --> 00:42:19,182
Who knows?...I may go to Spain one day.

556
00:42:19,747 --> 00:42:25,743
Let's see now...you've been here 4 months....

557
00:42:25,744 --> 00:42:26,744
...and you've read Boswell in 4 volumes.

558
00:42:26,747 --> 00:42:30,422
I should now recommend something
in ONE volume!

559
00:42:31,067 --> 00:42:33,103
One thin volume.

560
00:42:38,947 --> 00:42:42,098
Tell me...Do you believe
in a life after death?

561
00:42:43,067 --> 00:42:46,264
In a vague sort of way...
I suppose I do.

562
00:42:46,787 --> 00:42:48,937
I never banked on it though,
until recently.

563
00:42:49,187 --> 00:42:52,862
I take it you're not particular what happens
to your body after you are dead.

564
00:42:53,787 --> 00:42:57,860
No, I suppose the guy who gets
blown to bits by a bomb...

565
00:42:58,187 --> 00:43:00,747
...and there's no remains to preserve afterwards,
will make it...

566
00:43:01,067 --> 00:43:02,466
If there's anything to make.

567
00:43:02,627 --> 00:43:05,726
The disposal of the body has always been
one of the greatest problems

568
00:43:05,726 --> 00:43:07,529
facing the would-be murderer.

569
00:43:07,867 --> 00:43:11,906
Many excellently conceived
and meticulously planned murders have failed...

570
00:43:12,787 --> 00:43:16,336
...when the moment arrives to do
the disappearing trick with the remains.

571
00:43:17,747 --> 00:43:20,864
Burning would seem a very simple
and tempting way out...

572
00:43:21,627 --> 00:43:24,460
...but it usually fails,
when to the murderer's horror...

573
00:43:24,627 --> 00:43:27,585
...his victim's body simply refuses
to turn to ashes.

574
00:43:28,107 --> 00:43:32,146
Burial in the garden,
in the cellars or the like...

575
00:43:32,347 --> 00:43:33,826
...too often proves
but a temporary hiding place.

576
00:43:34,547 --> 00:43:39,098
Taking the body to sea in a little boat
and throwing it overboard, well-weighted...

577
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,505
...is not really to be recommended.

578
00:43:42,067 --> 00:43:44,456
There must be plenty
of quiet places in England.

579
00:43:44,827 --> 00:43:48,048
Why not dig just a sort of big hole...
and put me in?

580
00:43:48,267 --> 00:43:51,862
Burial in some secluded spot?
Definitely no!

581
00:43:52,067 --> 00:43:52,951
Why not?

582
00:43:52,951 --> 00:43:56,777
Well, you see, fate usually
seems to decree

583
00:43:56,107 --> 00:43:59,543
that the spot which has remained
secluded for centuries...

584
00:44:00,067 --> 00:44:02,501
...suddenly becomes the Mecca of picnic parties...

585
00:44:02,587 --> 00:44:05,704
...with dogs that dig holes
unearthing the grave.

586
00:44:05,867 --> 00:44:09,746
Why not cut me up in little pieces
and sort of sprinkle me around.

587
00:44:10,107 --> 00:44:12,098
No, I can't feel remotely attracted.

588
00:44:12,547 --> 00:44:16,142
Didn't I read of a case of a guy
who shoved his victim into trunk...

589
00:44:16,307 --> 00:44:18,775
..and checked the trunk in a cloakroom...
How about that?

590
00:44:19,067 --> 00:44:22,901
No, most old-fashioned!...it's almost
an English institution.

591
00:44:23,267 --> 00:44:26,072
And the percentage of failures
is most discouraging.

592
00:44:26,467 --> 00:44:29,539
You can see I've given the matter
quite a considerable amount of thought.

593
00:44:29,907 --> 00:44:33,741
And you're stuck with it...
and no way out.

594
00:44:33,987 --> 00:44:37,821
On the contrary...I've found a unique
and effective way out.

595
00:44:39,027 --> 00:44:41,541
The answer to my problem is in
those rubber water-bottles.

596
00:44:42,507 --> 00:44:47,183
In there is a concentrate which I guarantee
will dissolve every atom

597
00:44:47,387 --> 00:44:49,776
of flesh and bone in the human body,
within a few hours.

598
00:44:50,507 --> 00:44:51,917
Congratulations!

599
00:44:51,917 --> 00:44:54,004
The formula is not complicated.

600
00:44:54,987 --> 00:44:56,261
Should have quite a sale.

601
00:44:56,627 --> 00:45:02,399
My main problem was to ensure that the solution
had the desired effect upon the flesh...

602
00:45:02,399 --> 00:45:06,899
without reacting in a similar fashion
towards iron, steel, brass, lead...

603
00:45:07,107 --> 00:45:10,463
...and other metals used
in plumbing arrangements.

604
00:45:11,747 --> 00:45:14,056
So I'm to be poured down the drain...
Is that it?

605
00:45:14,187 --> 00:45:18,658
Exactly...you'll appreciate the convenience.
Any questions?

606
00:45:20,027 --> 00:45:23,224
I don't want you to think I'm trying
to poke holes in your little scheme, or...

607
00:45:23,267 --> 00:45:26,145
...or try delaying tactics,
or anything like that...

608
00:45:26,307 --> 00:45:27,259
How do you mean?

609
00:45:27,259 --> 00:45:30,952
Are you sure this mixture of yours
really works?

610
00:45:30,987 --> 00:45:33,056
I wish you hadn't reminded me of that.

611
00:45:33,507 --> 00:45:37,546
You see, our little chat has quite made me
forget a very unhappy decision...

612
00:45:37,667 --> 00:45:38,702
...that I've been forced to make.

613
00:45:39,827 --> 00:45:42,057
Here!...Monty!

614
00:45:44,507 --> 00:45:45,825
You see, I have no alternative.

615
00:45:45,825 --> 00:45:49,090
Our little friend followed me here once.
He'll do it again.

616
00:45:49,267 --> 00:45:51,517
If that's your idea of a gag...
you sure got a corny sense of humour.

617
00:45:52,957 --> 00:45:53,987
Come along, Monty.

618
00:45:55,467 --> 00:45:57,139
Oh Clive, for Pete's sakes!

619
00:45:57,787 --> 00:45:59,618
Come here, Monty, come here!

620
00:46:00,747 --> 00:46:02,817
Here Monty, come on!

621
00:46:02,987 --> 00:46:05,899
- Monty!
- Clive, no. you wouldn't...

622
00:46:06,107 --> 00:46:08,575
- Monty!
- Come here, boy!

623
00:46:09,307 --> 00:46:11,696
Come on...come on...Monty!

624
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,740
- No.
- Good boy!

625
00:46:14,147 --> 00:46:15,978
Clive, no!

626
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:17,222
Clive!

627
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:25,803
Come on, Monty...come here!

628
00:46:27,187 --> 00:46:29,826
Monty, come here, boy!

629
00:46:30,107 --> 00:46:33,543
Monty...please....
come on you fool!

630
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:38,242
Monty, atta boy!

631
00:46:38,867 --> 00:46:40,372
You dumb dog...you!

632
00:46:41,387 --> 00:46:42,615
Come and get him!

633
00:46:45,627 --> 00:46:46,742
Good boy!

634
00:46:50,147 --> 00:46:53,696
Well, I understood that any dog who is lost,
is taken to Battersea Dog's Home immediately.

635
00:46:54,187 --> 00:46:55,779
Aitkin, come here.

636
00:46:56,587 --> 00:46:59,306
Well, you have a description...please phone me
the moment you find him.

637
00:47:00,307 --> 00:47:01,275
Did you do that?

638
00:47:01,275 --> 00:47:04,641
The advertisement will appear
in tomorrow morning's "Times" and "Telegraph".

639
00:47:04,707 --> 00:47:07,460
...and in the "Evening News", "Standard" and  "Star"
tomorrow night.

640
00:47:07,587 --> 00:47:09,020
Alright! Alright!

641
00:47:10,507 --> 00:47:12,338
Where's Monty?

642
00:47:12,387 --> 00:47:13,969
Yes, he's with you, isn't he?

643
00:47:13,969 --> 00:47:15,367
Why should he be with me?

644
00:47:15,427 --> 00:47:17,322
He slipped his collar and ran after you
to the garage.

645
00:47:17,322 --> 00:47:18,979
Let's call him, then.

646
00:47:19,147 --> 00:47:22,184
Not this garage...at your rooms.

647
00:47:22,547 --> 00:47:23,603
Oh, that garage?

648
00:47:23,603 --> 00:47:25,050
Well, where is he?

649
00:47:25,307 --> 00:47:28,743
My dear Storm...I can quite understand
your being overwrought if you lost your dog...

650
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:30,479
Why take it out on me?

651
00:47:30,479 --> 00:47:32,982
He wouldn't run away from me
for nothing.

652
00:47:32,227 --> 00:47:34,482
He saw you and ran after you...
you must have seen him.

653
00:47:34,517 --> 00:47:35,866
May we have dinner?...
I'm hungry.

654
00:47:40,747 --> 00:47:42,066
Aitkin, Aitkin!

655
00:47:43,507 --> 00:47:45,304
- Dinner!
- Yes, Madam.

656
00:47:57,947 --> 00:48:00,461
if he's really lost...
you'd better try Battersea.

657
00:48:00,747 --> 00:48:01,705
Thanks.

658
00:48:01,705 --> 00:48:04,686
Or you might think of putting an advertisement
in one of the papers.

659
00:48:04,747 --> 00:48:06,977
I do wish you wouldn't put
your coat on my bed.

660
00:48:07,387 --> 00:48:11,397
He's a dear little chap...Don't worry...
He'll probably turn up.

661
00:49:11,827 --> 00:49:13,810
- Dr. Riordan?
- Yes.

662
00:49:13,845 --> 00:49:14,938
My name's Finsbury.

663
00:49:14,938 --> 00:49:17,330
I'm sorry, but I don't see patients
after hours.

664
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:18,456
No, I suppose not.

665
00:49:18,667 --> 00:49:21,369
Perhaps if you'd care to telephone in the morning
for an appointment.

666
00:49:21,404 --> 00:49:24,178
I'm afraid we're at cross purposes.
I'm sorry if I mislead you.

667
00:49:24,867 --> 00:49:26,041
So you're not a patient.

668
00:49:26,041 --> 00:49:27,813
No, I'm afraid I'm not.

669
00:49:30,627 --> 00:49:32,950
Pleasant room.
May I sit down?

670
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:34,240
Yes, of course.

671
00:49:36,507 --> 00:49:38,543
I expect you'd like to know
what I'm doing here.

672
00:49:40,587 --> 00:49:43,818
Quite...well it's about a dog
I believe you lost.

673
00:49:44,787 --> 00:49:49,303
A dog answering to the name of...
It's here in your advertisement.

674
00:49:52,987 --> 00:49:56,502
Yes, here it is...Monty.

675
00:49:56,947 --> 00:49:58,938
White, no markings.

676
00:50:00,347 --> 00:50:02,986
Sir, I do apologise
for breaking in on you like this.

677
00:50:03,227 --> 00:50:04,275
Have you found the dog?

678
00:50:04,275 --> 00:50:06,648
No, I haven't...actually.

679
00:50:06,867 --> 00:50:08,007
Well then, I don't understand.

680
00:50:08,107 --> 00:50:10,701
I was wondering if you could elaborate
on this description.

681
00:50:10,747 --> 00:50:11,816
No, I'm afraid I can't.

682
00:50:12,227 --> 00:50:14,616
Or perhaps give some more details
as to how the dog was lost.

683
00:50:15,027 --> 00:50:17,302
Do I understand that you're proposing
to search for the dog?

684
00:50:17,907 --> 00:50:20,899
In a sort of way...
it's part of my job, you see.

685
00:50:21,347 --> 00:50:22,278
What job?

686
00:50:22,278 --> 00:50:24,530
I'm from Scotland Yard.

687
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:28,409
We get the silliest jobs sometimes.

688
00:50:28,409 --> 00:50:31,784
Scotland Yard....looking for a lost dog?

689
00:50:31,067 --> 00:50:33,820
I wondered myself...
but I suppose strings were pulled.

690
00:50:34,307 --> 00:50:36,025
You know how these things
are handled sometimes.

691
00:50:36,347 --> 00:50:39,668
And I was given my instructions
and the statement made by Mrs Riordan.

692
00:50:40,307 --> 00:50:44,095
My wife went to Scotland Yard?
- Yes, surely she told you?

693
00:50:44,096 --> 00:50:44,374
Why yes...surely she told you?

694
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:47,220
No, have you my wife's statement
with you?

695
00:50:47,347 --> 00:50:48,382
I have, as a matter of fact.

696
00:50:48,427 --> 00:50:49,780
- May I see it?
- Certainly.

697
00:51:00,787 --> 00:51:02,803
Oh, I'm afraid I can't add
anything further.

698
00:51:02,803 --> 00:51:04,911
Oh, that is disappointing.

699
00:51:06,907 --> 00:51:08,521
You were our last hope.

700
00:51:08,521 --> 00:51:10,500
Yes, it's a pity isn't it.
He was a dear little chap.

701
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:13,140
Well, it's awfully nice of you
to have taken so much trouble.

702
00:51:13,147 --> 00:51:14,246
Not at all.

703
00:51:14,246 --> 00:51:17,458
And perhaps you'll thank
your superior at the Yard.

704
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:19,501
of course...I'll certainly thank my superior.

705
00:51:19,536 --> 00:51:21,189
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to be patronising...

706
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,736
But I take it you're
a comparatively new recruit?

707
00:51:24,771 --> 00:51:27,187
Oh dear!  And I try so hard
to look wise and worldly!

708
00:51:27,507 --> 00:51:29,862
By the way, what is your...rank...
is that the word?

709
00:51:30,187 --> 00:51:33,065
Yes, that's the word...
I'm a superintendent.

710
00:51:37,907 --> 00:51:40,546
You're THE Superintendent Finsbury?

711
00:51:40,907 --> 00:51:44,527
Really?...I've always wanted
to meet a crime specialist.

712
00:51:44,547 --> 00:51:45,830
Interested in murder, Doctor?

713
00:51:45,830 --> 00:51:47,751
Well, in an amateurish sort of way, yes.

714
00:51:48,187 --> 00:51:50,826
Don't be modest...
All murderers are amateurs, you know.

715
00:51:51,587 --> 00:51:53,339
Nobody makes a profession
out of murder.

716
00:51:53,747 --> 00:51:57,535
In fact the only professionals in the game
are those who try and catch the murderers.

717
00:52:02,987 --> 00:52:04,164
Perhaps you hadn't thought of that?

718
00:52:04,164 --> 00:52:06,192
No, I hadn't.

719
00:52:06,227 --> 00:52:07,016
Goodbye.

720
00:53:06,867 --> 00:53:09,437
I say, I'm most frightfully sorry
to worry you again like this...

721
00:53:09,507 --> 00:53:12,260
I see you're interested in my trains
and where's my dog.

722
00:53:12,787 --> 00:53:16,621
There was one small point
I completely forgot...

723
00:53:16,827 --> 00:53:19,739
..and really didn't fancy worrying you
in your consulting rooms...

724
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:20,597
Well?

725
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:23,282
It's really frightfully unimportant,
but as I'm here...

726
00:53:23,282 --> 00:53:24,543
Carry on.

727
00:53:24,543 --> 00:53:26,425
Well, you remember a young fellow...

728
00:53:27,547 --> 00:53:30,744
What was his name?
Disappeared some months ago...

729
00:53:31,187 --> 00:53:33,641
Friend of yours...what was his name?

730
00:53:33,641 --> 00:53:35,739
Kronin...Bill Kronin.

731
00:53:35,774 --> 00:53:39,455
That's right, Kronin.
We made several enquiries about him, didn't we?

732
00:53:39,584 --> 00:53:42,753
...and as far as I remember
you couldn't help us much.

733
00:53:42,753 --> 00:53:44,038
No, poor old Bill!

734
00:53:45,287 --> 00:53:46,220
Poor old Bill?

735
00:53:46,227 --> 00:53:49,553
Well, I suppose something pretty awful
must have happened to him...don't you?

736
00:53:49,987 --> 00:53:53,327
I don't know...he might have got himself
into some sort of a jam...

737
00:53:53,327 --> 00:53:56,114
and thought the best thing to do
was to disappear.

738
00:53:56,147 --> 00:53:57,636
Bill in a jam?

739
00:53:57,636 --> 00:54:00,982
Yes...with a girl, for instance.

740
00:54:00,427 --> 00:54:01,897
A married woman perhaps.

741
00:54:01,897 --> 00:54:03,142
Oh, no...not him.

742
00:54:03,387 --> 00:54:04,712
You think that's so impossible?

743
00:54:04,712 --> 00:54:06,987
Well, not impossible...
but extremely unlikely.

744
00:54:07,027 --> 00:54:11,498
Really? Well, not everybody shares
your high opinion of Mr Kronin.

745
00:54:11,587 --> 00:54:12,836
How do you mean?

746
00:54:12,836 --> 00:54:16,147
I'm thinking about an anonymous letter
we had at the Yard...

747
00:54:16,147 --> 00:54:17,700
...soon after Kronin disappeared.

748
00:54:18,267 --> 00:54:21,905
I wouldn't have brought it up, actually,
but as I'm here about the dog...

749
00:54:21,987 --> 00:54:25,059
I hope you won't think I'm meddling
in your private affairs.

750
00:54:25,307 --> 00:54:26,660
What on earth are you talking about?

751
00:54:26,747 --> 00:54:29,120
Well someone or other wrote to us...

752
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:32,724
and said that Kronin had been having
an intrigue with a married woman.

753
00:54:32,724 --> 00:54:34,006
Even mentioned the lady's name.

754
00:54:34,805 --> 00:54:36,750
You'll be all for knowing.

755
00:54:36,827 --> 00:54:38,465
The lady in the case
was your wife.

756
00:54:40,067 --> 00:54:42,921
- My wife?
- Yes, I know..I'm sorry.

757
00:54:43,147 --> 00:54:47,236
Well, this chap, you know, the letter-writer...
went on and hinted...

758
00:54:47,236 --> 00:54:50,684
...that because of this, you had something
to do with Kronin's disappearance.

759
00:54:51,547 --> 00:54:56,223
My wife and Bill, fantastic!
may I see the letter?

760
00:54:56,224 --> 00:54:57,224
I don't carry that sort of nonsense
about with me.

761
00:54:59,067 --> 00:55:00,821
Well why didn't you
come to me at once?

762
00:55:02,947 --> 00:55:03,311
Oh, no....we're reasonably circumspect.

763
00:55:03,427 --> 00:55:06,942
We don't necessarily believe all the tales
we're told in anonymous letters.

764
00:55:07,227 --> 00:55:11,266
We checked up...and as we could find
no confirmation of any such...

765
00:55:11,987 --> 00:55:16,265
...shall I say "surreptitious friendship"
between Mrs Riordan and Kronin...

766
00:55:16,347 --> 00:55:18,837
...we decided not to upset you needlessly.

767
00:55:18,837 --> 00:55:20,291
That was very nice of you.

768
00:55:20,587 --> 00:55:24,074
Do I take it then,
that as far as you were aware...

769
00:55:24,074 --> 00:55:27,178
...there was no intrigue
between your wife and Kronin?

770
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:27,643
But of course not.

771
00:55:28,027 --> 00:55:31,483
You had no reason to threaten Kronin
or desire his death.

772
00:55:31,518 --> 00:55:32,386
Certainly not.

773
00:55:40,987 --> 00:55:43,103
Well, good night, Doctor.

774
00:56:10,067 --> 00:56:11,102
Hi, pal!

775
00:56:15,006 --> 00:56:16,165
Why you seeing me?####

776
00:56:32,852 --> 00:56:34,800
No eats tonight, Monty.

777
00:56:36,067 --> 00:56:37,659
Don't like the looks of that, old son.

778
00:56:39,867 --> 00:56:40,902
Clive!

779
00:56:46,267 --> 00:56:48,273
I say...Clive!...

780
00:56:51,267 --> 00:56:53,622
Is this it?  Tonight?

781
00:56:55,067 --> 00:56:56,295
I'd rather know.

782
00:56:57,467 --> 00:57:00,300
Oh, I see what you mean...
No, this is not "it".

783
00:57:00,987 --> 00:57:05,420
On the contrary...the unexpected
has happened.

784
00:57:05,427 --> 00:57:09,943
The alert continues...you have in fact
been granted a reprieve.

785
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:12,824
- I have?
- Temporarily.

786
00:57:13,707 --> 00:57:15,379
- For how long?
- That depends.

787
00:57:15,987 --> 00:57:16,913
On what?

788
00:57:16,913 --> 00:57:19,138
On my assumption being correct...

789
00:57:18,307 --> 00:57:21,335
...that Scotland Yard is bluffing
and knows precisely nothing.

790
00:57:21,667 --> 00:57:23,909
Scotland Yard...are they in on this?

791
00:57:23,909 --> 00:57:25,038
They are.

792
00:57:25,907 --> 00:57:30,782
Whatta you know! Boy! Scotland Yard!
Did you hear what he said?

793
00:57:31,707 --> 00:57:36,188
In fact their representatives were about 50 yards
from this place about 10 minutes ago.

794
00:57:36,267 --> 00:57:40,180
They were? And you came on down here anyhow?
They'll follow you won't they?

795
00:57:40,307 --> 00:57:41,179
Why should they?

796
00:57:41,464 --> 00:57:45,094
Don't you realise that I'm acting
on the assumption that they know nothing.

797
00:57:45,667 --> 00:57:48,033
They'd hardly imagine I'd pay daily visits

798
00:57:48,033 --> 00:57:50,264
to a man that disappeared
5 months ago.

799
00:57:52,307 --> 00:57:55,175
No I guess not.
You sure got nerve, Clive.

800
00:57:55,587 --> 00:57:59,106
The important thing at the moment
is not to deviate one iota from my plan.

801
00:57:59,141 --> 00:58:02,815
And not to panic...or to make the mistake
so often made by murderers.

802
00:58:03,067 --> 00:58:03,781
What's that?

803
00:58:03,781 --> 00:58:06,503
Assuming the police
know more than they do.

804
00:58:06,867 --> 00:58:08,585
Crippen was a classic case in point.

805
00:58:09,107 --> 00:58:13,390
It was only because he fled from the country,
that he attracted attention to himself.

806
00:58:16,347 --> 00:58:18,542
I'll bid you goodnight
in complete confidence...

807
00:58:19,067 --> 00:58:22,408
...that I shall hear no more from
the gentleman from Scotland Yard.

808
00:58:24,827 --> 00:58:27,237
Did you hear that, Monty?...
We got some more time.

809
00:58:27,507 --> 00:58:31,102
Come on old boy...now school's in...
see what you can remember now.

810
00:58:31,587 --> 00:58:32,656
Sit down...sit down!

811
00:58:34,307 --> 00:58:36,946
Hold, hold, Monty.

812
00:58:37,587 --> 00:58:40,499
That's a good boy...
You're learning fast.

813
00:58:40,547 --> 00:58:44,984
Once more...sit down...
hold it, Monty.

814
00:58:59,307 --> 00:59:00,535
Oh, hello, Doctor.

815
00:59:01,227 --> 00:59:04,108
I really can't apologise enough...
My mind you know.

816
00:59:04,108 --> 00:59:06,967
Definitely going... There was
another little point that I forgot.

817
00:59:07,587 --> 00:59:09,032
Could I see your gun?

818
00:59:09,032 --> 00:59:11,225
How did you know that I had a gun?

819
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:14,049
Some young fellow at the Yard
was checking over licences the other day.

820
00:59:14,107 --> 00:59:16,337
Nothing better to do, you know.
May I see it?

821
00:59:16,857 --> 00:59:17,867
Of course.

822
00:59:21,827 --> 00:59:24,888
Thank you. You keep this fully loaded?

823
00:59:24,888 --> 00:59:25,566
Naturally.

824
00:59:25,627 --> 00:59:27,219
- Have you fired it lately?
- No.

825
00:59:27,867 --> 00:59:29,106
When did you last fire it?

826
00:59:29,106 --> 00:59:30,344
I don't know...weeks ago.

827
00:59:30,427 --> 00:59:31,424
Well, try and remember.

828
00:59:31,424 --> 00:59:33,906
I've been very patient with you
so far, Finsbury.

829
00:59:33,941 --> 00:59:36,976
But I warn you, I'm getting sick and tired
of your investigations.

830
00:59:37,187 --> 00:59:39,940
It's a nice state of affairs if a man
can't accidentally fire his own gun

831
00:59:40,107 --> 00:59:44,354
in his own drawing room, without Scotland Yard
pestering him as if he were a criminal.

832
00:59:44,389 --> 00:59:45,466
It's outrageous.

833
00:59:45,466 --> 00:59:46,183
Where's the bullet?

834
00:59:46,183 --> 00:59:46,876
What bullet?

835
00:59:46,876 --> 00:59:48,579
The one you accidentally fired.

836
00:59:49,067 --> 00:59:50,929
You've got so much time to waste...

837
00:59:50,929 --> 00:59:53,947
Why don't you go and get a warrant
and search for the bullet.

838
00:59:53,827 --> 00:59:55,340
I don't think that will be necessary.

839
01:00:05,427 --> 01:00:06,576
There we are.

840
01:00:07,307 --> 01:00:08,342
Now for the bullet.

841
01:00:15,787 --> 01:00:19,143
How's that.  Well I think
this clears matters up, Doctor.

842
01:00:19,587 --> 01:00:21,259
I'm terribly sorry if I've upset you...

843
01:00:21,427 --> 01:00:23,736
...by appearing to hound you
from pillar to post.

844
01:00:24,227 --> 01:00:27,060
But I have to check up
on these silly little points...

845
01:00:27,347 --> 01:00:28,860
...or I get a rap over the knuckles.

846
01:00:29,307 --> 01:00:31,537
Pure routine, you know.

847
01:00:31,787 --> 01:00:32,936
Routine!

848
01:00:33,067 --> 01:00:35,305
May I borrow this for a few days?

849
01:00:35,306 --> 01:00:36,220
Yes...yes...

850
01:00:36,267 --> 01:00:38,258
- Thank you
- Let me show you out.

851
01:00:38,987 --> 01:00:41,706
Thank you. Exceptional weather
we've been having lately.

852
01:00:41,747 --> 01:00:44,341
- Exceptional.
- Well, thanks again, Doctor.

853
01:00:44,747 --> 01:00:46,857
I'm so glad we've been able
to have our little chats

854
01:00:46,857 --> 01:00:48,865
without dragging your wife
into them.

855
01:00:48,865 --> 01:00:50,702
Quite...Well, good night.

856
01:01:54,547 --> 01:01:56,158
Monty, no, boy...sit down.

857
01:01:58,227 --> 01:02:01,025
Clive?  Tonight?

858
01:02:02,787 --> 01:02:04,693
You know, you don't seem to realise...

859
01:02:06,187 --> 01:02:07,939
Quiet! I don't want to speak..I just want to know..
Is it tonight...yes or no?

860
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:10,429
No.

861
01:02:15,267 --> 01:02:17,159
I don't expect you to believe me...

862
01:02:17,159 --> 01:02:21,432
...but these few last months have been getting
me down almost as much as they have you.

863
01:02:21,867 --> 01:02:23,904
I too will be glad when it's all over.

864
01:02:24,147 --> 01:02:25,216
Thanks...pal!

865
01:02:28,067 --> 01:02:30,153
At least I taught you
to make a decent martini.

866
01:02:32,227 --> 01:02:34,616
- Any more visits from the Scotland Yard guy?
- No.

867
01:02:35,747 --> 01:02:38,898
He must have been onto something...
He must have.

868
01:02:38,899 --> 01:02:39,899
I thought so, too

869
01:02:41,987 --> 01:02:44,169
At first?  Not now?

870
01:02:44,169 --> 01:02:45,815
No, not now.

871
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:46,594
Why not?

872
01:02:46,594 --> 01:02:49,666
Because now I know
exactly where I stand.

873
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:54,143
Well...go on!

874
01:02:56,947 --> 01:02:59,716
Well, you always want to make speeches...
Go on, speak!

875
01:03:04,307 --> 01:03:05,786
You see...it's just a question of logic.

876
01:03:07,427 --> 01:03:12,182
Reason tells me, the Scotland Yard guy
made a leading mistake when he came to my house.

877
01:03:13,267 --> 01:03:16,454
There were only 3 people who knew
the location of the spent bullet.

878
01:03:16,454 --> 01:03:18,479
You, myself and Storm.

879
01:03:18,667 --> 01:03:21,386
Yet Mr Finsbury went straight
to the filled-in hole.

880
01:03:22,147 --> 01:03:25,184
Now, who could have told him?
I didn't and you didn't.

881
01:03:25,467 --> 01:03:26,502
- Is that all?
- No.

882
01:03:27,267 --> 01:03:30,179
Consider the anonymous letter
which he almost forgot to mention.

883
01:03:30,947 --> 01:03:33,051
Now you and Storm
would be much too smart

884
01:03:33,051 --> 01:03:35,829
to let anyone else know
about your secret intrigue.

885
01:03:35,864 --> 01:03:38,819
Yet Finsbury knew all the facts.
Who could have told him?

886
01:03:40,067 --> 01:03:41,580
- Storm, eh?
- Exactly.

887
01:03:42,107 --> 01:03:47,070
My under-estimation of her feelings towards me
might have been a serious mistake.

888
01:03:47,427 --> 01:03:49,099
But instead, thanks to her...

889
01:03:49,587 --> 01:03:51,794
...I stood the test
of a Scotland Yard enquiry.

890
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:55,033
They checked up on her story
and found precisely nothing.

891
01:03:55,067 --> 01:03:57,183
It'll be just her word against mine.

892
01:03:57,587 --> 01:03:59,339
And you know, you ought to be
very grateful.

893
01:03:59,947 --> 01:04:01,778
You've got a few weeks reprieve...

894
01:04:02,667 --> 01:04:06,378
Which I regret to say
will soon come to an end.

895
01:04:07,587 --> 01:04:10,203
- Clive, you've forgotten one thing!
- What?

896
01:04:10,203 --> 01:04:11,854
What's that?

897
01:04:12,005 --> 01:04:13,171
You haven't got it back yet.

898
01:04:13,171 --> 01:04:14,254
What?

899
01:04:14,289 --> 01:04:17,211
The gun...they haven't given it back to you...
It's still at Scotland Yard.

900
01:04:17,307 --> 01:04:19,654
But there's no interest in the gun, now.

901
01:04:19,654 --> 01:04:20,916
That's what you think...now!

902
01:04:20,916 --> 01:04:23,280
But you're wrong...they're not
hanging on to it for nothing, you know.

903
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,737
They must have a reason.

904
01:04:24,737 --> 01:04:27,058
Don't kid yourself...this case isn't closed...
They haven't given it back, yet.

905
01:04:27,907 --> 01:04:29,274
Good night, Bill.

906
01:04:29,274 --> 01:04:32,393
The gun, Clive. Why haven't they
given you back the gun?

907
01:04:38,987 --> 01:04:43,094
Come on Monty boy,
we haven't very much more time.

908
01:04:43,667 --> 01:04:46,129
You've done it once before buddy...
you better do it again.

909
01:04:47,507 --> 01:04:49,463
Come on now, boy...

910
01:04:49,587 --> 01:04:53,086
Good dog, now...hold...hold!

911
01:04:53,475 --> 01:04:55,778
Well, come on...don't just sit there
and look at it...Hold!

912
01:04:55,778 --> 01:04:58,694
Atta boy! atta boy! Good boy!

913
01:04:58,694 --> 01:05:01,148
Tug...tug...atta boy!

914
01:05:02,728 --> 01:05:03,679
Oh, look out!

915
01:05:04,242 --> 01:05:08,149
Oh no, no...boy...bad dog, Monty!

916
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:10,479
Bad dog...never fall in...no!

917
01:05:10,587 --> 01:05:12,657
Hold, but never fall in, never!

918
01:05:16,427 --> 01:05:19,658
- Yes?
- Excuse me sir, there's a gentleman to see you.

919
01:05:19,827 --> 01:05:22,102
- Who is it?
- A Mr Finsbury, sir.

920
01:05:24,227 --> 01:05:26,377
- Ask him to come down.
- Very good, sir.

921
01:05:38,867 --> 01:05:40,585
- Hello, Doctor!
- This is a pleasure.

922
01:05:42,227 --> 01:05:44,582
So this is how you spend
your Saturday afternoons.

923
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:45,556
It's pretty strenuous.

924
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:48,047
What a terrific collection
you have here!

925
01:05:48,187 --> 01:05:48,926
Not bad.

926
01:05:48,926 --> 01:05:52,384
My word...you HAVE gone to town!

927
01:05:53,641 --> 01:05:54,543
While I think of it...

928
01:05:54,543 --> 01:05:56,897
My memory, you know...
Your gun.

929
01:05:57,027 --> 01:05:59,666
- Sorry we kept it so long.
- Thanks.

930
01:06:00,107 --> 01:06:03,702
Then, you're not going to hang me
or anything dreadful like that.

931
01:06:03,702 --> 01:06:06,644
Good heavens, no...it's been
floating around my office for weeks.

932
01:06:06,707 --> 01:06:09,452
I've been up to my eyes
in the Lawrence murder.

933
01:06:09,487 --> 01:06:11,585
- Any luck?
- Yes, as a matter of fact.

934
01:06:11,585 --> 01:06:14,103
I made an arrest this morning.

935
01:06:14,747 --> 01:06:15,782
May I?

936
01:06:17,267 --> 01:06:20,453
Royal Scot 460.
Nice jobs, weren't they?

937
01:06:21,107 --> 01:06:22,769
I say...this isn't right...

938
01:06:22,769 --> 01:06:24,071
What isn't?

939
01:06:24,106 --> 01:06:26,057
The tender...those flares shouldn't be there.

940
01:06:26,387 --> 01:06:28,139
- The sides should be straight.
- No, they shouldn't.

941
01:06:28,387 --> 01:06:30,298
- I think you'll find...
- I assure you you're wrong.

942
01:06:30,947 --> 01:06:33,415
You see, 1927, when the Royal Scot came out...

943
01:06:33,827 --> 01:06:36,261
They did have those straight-sided tenders.

944
01:06:36,747 --> 01:06:40,262
But in 1937 they introduced those curved ones.

945
01:06:42,227 --> 01:06:44,821
Sorry, my mistake...
Not bad for a psychiatrist.

946
01:06:44,907 --> 01:06:47,865
Thanks, pal...
Would you care for a drink?

947
01:06:48,507 --> 01:06:50,623
Well, I'm off duty...
Yes I'd love one.

948
01:06:51,267 --> 01:06:54,065
You know, I've never gone in
for any strenuous form of exercise...

949
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:58,261
I've always got my relaxation
in a complete mental change, like this.

950
01:06:58,347 --> 01:06:59,081
Good idea.

951
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:02,499
All the same, I've been feeling
a bit run down lately...

952
01:07:01,667 --> 01:07:04,545
So I plan to take a holiday
in a few days...

953
01:07:04,947 --> 01:07:07,619
...when I've got one or two things
cleared up.

954
01:07:07,627 --> 01:07:10,044
Half your luck!
Cheers, Doctor.

955
01:07:10,827 --> 01:07:12,052
Where were you thinking
of going?

956
01:07:12,052 --> 01:07:14,555
I don't know...Cannes
or somewhere where it's sunny.

957
01:07:15,307 --> 01:07:18,743
I suppose it's alright for me
to leave the country.

958
01:07:20,027 --> 01:07:24,319
You won't think I'm running away...
guilty conscience or anything, like Crippen.

959
01:07:24,467 --> 01:07:28,142
I see what you mean.  No, you can go
to the North Pole if you feel like it.

960
01:07:28,347 --> 01:07:29,602
Thanks, pal.

961
01:07:31,052 --> 01:07:32,641
Well, if you'll excuse me, Doctor.

962
01:07:32,676 --> 01:07:34,583
I mustn't leave my chaps
waiting any longer.

963
01:07:36,947 --> 01:07:39,222
Don't bother...
I can find my own way out.

964
01:07:39,787 --> 01:07:44,702
- Well, goodbye, superintendent.
- Thanks, Doctor.  Have a good holiday.

965
01:07:44,787 --> 01:07:45,856
Thanks.

966
01:08:14,587 --> 01:08:17,385
You can go back and book off...
I'm walking home.

967
01:08:17,467 --> 01:08:19,686
Very good, sir.
Good night.

968
01:08:38,667 --> 01:08:41,852
Five bucks! Oh, for cryin' out loud!

969
01:08:41,887 --> 01:08:44,532
Listen, pal...only 5 bucks...

970
01:08:44,532 --> 01:08:47,553
There's a lifetime of work
gone into a book like this.

971
01:08:47,553 --> 01:08:49,868
It sent me back 20 bucks
a year ago.

972
01:08:50,427 --> 01:08:53,464
But it's yours for 5 bucks...
on account of I'm goin' home.

973
01:08:53,787 --> 01:08:59,078
Thanks, pal...the finest address book
in the European theatre.

974
01:08:59,347 --> 01:09:01,469
Let me give you an idea
of the material.

975
01:09:03,083 --> 01:09:07,646
Betty! Betty...Oh, when I think of Betty.

976
01:09:07,647 --> 01:09:11,210
He eyes, blue...they bore
right through ya!

977
01:09:11,467 --> 01:09:12,727
And when you're dancing...

978
01:09:15,667 --> 01:09:17,670
Why, Betty alone's worth the 5 bucks.

979
01:09:17,670 --> 01:09:19,122
Thanks, pal!

980
01:09:20,067 --> 01:09:24,287
Rita, brunette...
that's her best feature

981
01:09:24,287 --> 01:09:26,996
- Gorgeous hair.
- Thanks, pal.

982
01:09:27,147 --> 01:09:30,457
Maybe you don't appreciate the spadework
that's  gone into a book like this.

983
01:09:41,867 --> 01:09:42,936
Hello?

984
01:09:50,267 --> 01:09:52,140
Yes, Mrs Riordan speaking.

985
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:53,836
Superintendent Finsbury here.

986
01:10:01,667 --> 01:10:05,865
"Thank, pal"... Yes..."Thanks, pal."

987
01:10:06,947 --> 01:10:09,142
No, it doesn't sound like Clive at all.

988
01:10:09,347 --> 01:10:11,907
It doesn't does it?
Just sort of struck me.

989
01:10:12,067 --> 01:10:14,023
You know how these things do
from time to time.

990
01:10:14,227 --> 01:10:17,503
Your husband's English vocabulary
seems quite adequate, you know.

991
01:10:17,827 --> 01:10:21,615
It did seem odd for him to borrow
from our cousins across the sea.

992
01:10:22,027 --> 01:10:23,566
- Does he know many Americans?

993
01:10:23,566 --> 01:10:25,576
No, I don't think so.

994
01:10:26,427 --> 01:10:30,048
Except...the only person I can think of

995
01:10:30,048 --> 01:10:33,097
who used to say "Thanks pal" a lot,
was Bill...Mr Kronin.

996
01:10:39,907 --> 01:10:41,625
Well, I can't explain it all
on the phone.

997
01:10:42,067 --> 01:10:44,058
In fact I really can't explain it at all.

998
01:10:44,267 --> 01:10:46,462
It's only a hunch, and I may be
chasing my shadow...

999
01:10:46,627 --> 01:10:49,903
...but it does strike me that a man
who is so precise in his speech...

1000
01:10:50,267 --> 01:10:52,019
...doesn't start using Americanisms...

1001
01:10:52,187 --> 01:10:54,940
...unless he's seeing rather a lot
of at least one American.

1002
01:10:55,587 --> 01:10:57,339
But he hasn't seen Bill for months,
as you know.

1003
01:10:57,667 --> 01:11:01,445
<i>I'm not so sure...I have a hunch
that Bill is still alive.</i>

1004
01:11:01,445 --> 01:11:04,309
Alive...Bill alive?

1005
01:11:10,987 --> 01:11:14,104
<i>Yes...well, as soon a you can...
I'll be waiting...</i>

1006
01:11:14,387 --> 01:11:17,379
<i>I'll be there...I don't know
if I can be there immediately.</i>

1007
01:11:18,187 --> 01:11:22,465
<i>I'll see what Clive's doing.
I can't wait to see you....goodbye.</i>

1008
01:12:15,227 --> 01:12:16,227
Storm!

1009
01:12:19,947 --> 01:12:22,825
- How about a drink before dinner?
- No thanks.

1010
01:12:23,267 --> 01:12:25,906
Well, don't just stand there...
come and sit down.

1011
01:12:29,427 --> 01:12:30,701
I'd like to talk to you.

1012
01:12:32,787 --> 01:12:34,266
Who was that on the telephone
just now?

1013
01:12:35,547 --> 01:12:37,923
 I said who was that 
on the telephone?

1014
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:39,581
Jane.

1015
01:12:39,587 --> 01:12:41,020
- Jane?
- Jane Hawser.

1016
01:12:41,427 --> 01:12:43,463
A very "masculine" voice, hasn't she?

1017
01:12:45,107 --> 01:12:47,940
I see...you listened of course.

1018
01:12:49,147 --> 01:12:50,147
How much did you hear?

1019
01:12:50,667 --> 01:12:52,981
Just enough to know
you're about to sneak off...

1020
01:12:52,981 --> 01:12:56,303
...to keep a secret rendezvous
with some man or other.

1021
01:12:58,227 --> 01:13:01,105
You're quite right,
it wasn't Jane.

1022
01:13:01,827 --> 01:13:04,864
Now who was it...Michael or John?

1023
01:13:05,267 --> 01:13:09,306
Perhaps it was Robert.
So difficult for you, isn't it?

1024
01:13:09,707 --> 01:13:11,504
It wasn't Bill, though, was it?

1025
01:13:15,347 --> 01:13:17,702
I said it wasn't Bill!

1026
01:13:17,987 --> 01:13:19,177
It could have been.

1027
01:13:19,177 --> 01:13:21,575
But surely you remember
you said I'd killed him.

1028
01:13:22,467 --> 01:13:26,590
I thought you had...
but you've killed Monty instead.

1029
01:13:26,625 --> 01:13:28,198
I really don't see the connection.

1030
01:13:30,107 --> 01:13:33,065
You kill a man?
You take a risk?

1031
01:13:33,427 --> 01:13:36,578
Oh, no...you'd sooner take it out
on a poor defenceless dog.

1032
01:13:37,547 --> 01:13:39,105
You fooled me for a while.

1033
01:13:39,547 --> 01:13:43,586
Until you got hold of Monty that afternoon,
and I saw right through you.

1034
01:13:43,867 --> 01:13:48,247
You bribed or scared Bill away...
and then took it out on my dog!

1035
01:13:48,587 --> 01:13:51,226
Very brave!

1036
01:13:52,267 --> 01:13:54,462
But Bill's still alive...I know he is.

1037
01:13:55,667 --> 01:13:58,110
- So that's it.
- That's exactly it.

1038
01:13:58,307 --> 01:14:02,529
I see...I see you need convincing.

1039
01:14:23,627 --> 01:14:26,664
Superintendent Finsbury, and please hurry,
it's terribly urgent.

1040
01:14:27,347 --> 01:14:30,259
Well can you get a message to him?...
it's a matter of life and death!

1041
01:14:30,747 --> 01:14:34,183
This is Mrs Riordan speaking.
Yes, that's right.

1042
01:14:34,467 --> 01:14:38,016
Tell him to come here to my house at once...
as fast as he can.

1043
01:14:38,387 --> 01:14:39,422
Thank you.

1044
01:15:32,867 --> 01:15:35,586
- Something's happened?
- You're right...Bill's alive.

1045
01:15:35,827 --> 01:15:38,216
But my husband's just gone off in his car...
He's going to kill him!

1046
01:15:38,507 --> 01:15:40,662
Really...are you sure?

1047
01:15:40,662 --> 01:15:43,299
We had a quarrel about you...
My husband thought you and I were...

1048
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:45,343
For heaven's sake, do something!

1049
01:15:45,343 --> 01:15:48,685
What? Can't exactly follow all that,
but you can explain it later, eh?

1050
01:15:48,685 --> 01:15:51,367
Let's concentrate on finding Kronin,
shall we?

1051
01:15:51,467 --> 01:15:52,616
What are you going to do?

1052
01:15:52,616 --> 01:15:54,682
The quickest way to find Kronin...

1053
01:15:54,682 --> 01:15:57,793
...if my hunch is right...
is to find your husband.

1054
01:15:57,828 --> 01:16:00,381
And the quickest way to find your husband
is to find his car.

1055
01:16:02,267 --> 01:16:04,576
Hello?
Superintendent Finsbury here.

1056
01:16:04,827 --> 01:16:08,456
Send out a general call...
Find a grey Austin saloon...

1057
01:16:08,667 --> 01:16:12,137
Registration number...
What is it, Mrs Riordan?

1058
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:14,337
- I haven't the faintest idea.
- Can you find it?

1059
01:16:14,547 --> 01:16:18,001
I should think so. It ought to be
among his papers on his desk.

1060
01:16:18,036 --> 01:16:18,856
Hang on a minute.

1061
01:16:37,627 --> 01:16:38,980
These look like car papers.

1062
01:16:40,467 --> 01:16:43,379
That's right. There's an insurance certificate.

1063
01:16:43,787 --> 01:16:46,176
- AYT 186.
- That's it.

1064
01:16:46,547 --> 01:16:47,696
- Is that an extension?
- Yes.

1065
01:16:50,707 --> 01:16:51,981
Still there?

1066
01:16:52,427 --> 01:16:55,385
Send out a general call...
Find a grey Austin saloon...

1067
01:16:55,827 --> 01:16:58,580
Registration AYT 186.

1068
01:17:18,507 --> 01:17:19,576
You're late.

1069
01:17:20,187 --> 01:17:21,779
It's Saturday...not office hours.

1070
01:17:22,267 --> 01:17:25,543
- Is it...Saturday again?
- Hungry?

1071
01:17:26,747 --> 01:17:28,897
Yeah...thirsty, too.

1072
01:17:30,067 --> 01:17:31,102
Here are the martinis.

1073
01:17:34,067 --> 01:17:35,295
Thanks.

1074
01:17:38,267 --> 01:17:41,942
I brought you a cold chicken...
your favorite.

1075
01:17:43,387 --> 01:17:44,456
Thanks.

1076
01:17:53,347 --> 01:17:54,985
"The condemned man
ate a hearty breakfast."...eh?

1077
01:17:57,107 --> 01:18:01,146
- The indigestion tablets?
- Sorry, I forgot them.

1078
01:18:02,735 --> 01:18:03,258
Papers?

1079
01:18:03,867 --> 01:18:05,823
They're outside...
I'll get then in a minute.

1080
01:18:06,867 --> 01:18:08,937
The service is deteriorating
around here.

1081
01:18:10,787 --> 01:18:14,621
Well, the martinis seem to be holding up.
Care for one, Clive?

1082
01:18:15,707 --> 01:18:17,026
No, not tonight.

1083
01:18:17,667 --> 01:18:20,227
I must say I admire your husband, Mrs Riordan.

1084
01:18:20,947 --> 01:18:26,465
Amazingly bright idea...
Most original.

1085
01:18:28,267 --> 01:18:29,825
I think I can see it all now...

1086
01:18:30,507 --> 01:18:35,262
Except, I wonder what he proposed to do
with the body when the time came.

1087
01:18:35,347 --> 01:18:36,629
How can you just sit there?

1088
01:18:36,629 --> 01:18:40,057
Dear Mrs Riordan,
what else can I do?

1089
01:18:39,867 --> 01:18:41,585
Are you sure my pipe
isn't worrying you?

1090
01:18:41,787 --> 01:18:43,698
Is this really Scotland Yard in action?

1091
01:18:43,987 --> 01:18:45,361
Once the wheels are in motion...

1092
01:18:45,876 --> 01:18:48,548
Some of us serve...
who only sit and wait, you know.

1093
01:18:49,067 --> 01:18:52,546
Not much point in my charging around,
all over London, by myself.

1094
01:18:53,627 --> 01:18:57,506
Big place, London...
I must show you London, some time.

1095
01:18:58,987 --> 01:19:00,022
You'd be astonished.

1096
01:19:01,267 --> 01:19:02,642
What's the matter Clive?

1097
01:19:02,642 --> 01:19:05,123
Not beating your chops
like you usually do.

1098
01:19:12,227 --> 01:19:16,266
What's going on over there...
more preparations for the big night?

1099
01:19:17,027 --> 01:19:19,018
Bloodstains you know are awful giveaways.

1100
01:19:19,947 --> 01:19:22,222
The dismemberment
is a terribly messy business.

1101
01:19:23,587 --> 01:19:26,147
- Are you feeling groggy?
- Yeah, I...

1102
01:19:27,067 --> 01:19:31,299
- How about another martini?
- I guess I will.

1103
01:19:33,787 --> 01:19:36,727
There have been 2 authenticated
and 3 hypothetical cases

1104
01:19:36,827 --> 01:19:40,137
of a murderer taking the perfect precautions
against bloodstains.

1105
01:19:41,027 --> 01:19:43,985
If one takes off all ones clothes
before starting work...

1106
01:19:44,347 --> 01:19:46,224
and there's a bathroom handy
for afterwards...

1107
01:19:46,627 --> 01:19:49,824
...the menace of bloodstained clothes
is obviously removed.

1108
01:19:51,467 --> 01:19:54,504
- How are you feeling?
- Kind of woozy.

1109
01:19:55,947 --> 01:19:59,303
Those martinis sort of hit me...
I taught you too well.

1110
01:20:01,587 --> 01:20:05,341
You know, what I need is a little exercise
and fresh air.

1111
01:20:07,147 --> 01:20:09,661
How about a little walk
around the block, Clive?

1112
01:20:11,667 --> 01:20:12,702
Coming?

1113
01:20:17,747 --> 01:20:20,580
Oh, no...you don't worry me.

1114
01:20:21,667 --> 01:20:24,784
You won't do anything
until you get that gun back.

1115
01:20:28,467 --> 01:20:31,265
Tis gun was returned to me
within the last hour.

1116
01:20:34,027 --> 01:20:35,460
It was?

1117
01:20:48,387 --> 01:20:54,178
Hello....there's a nice pussy, eh....
what's your name?

1118
01:21:21,747 --> 01:21:24,056
AYT 186.

1119
01:21:45,787 --> 01:21:50,099
Keeping the victim alive for a few months
and seeing which way the wind is blowing...

1120
01:21:50,507 --> 01:21:52,179
...before actually finishing him off.

1121
01:21:53,267 --> 01:21:56,623
That's a jolly good idea, you know.

1122
01:21:56,787 --> 01:21:58,823
How can you sit there
and do nothing?

1123
01:22:00,627 --> 01:22:03,380
Hello....yes, speaking.

1124
01:22:04,747 --> 01:22:08,183
Okay...yes I've got it.

1125
01:22:08,387 --> 01:22:10,742
I'll be right down...
Send another car along.

1126
01:22:10,987 --> 01:22:13,865
Oh, and you'd better
have them take a surgeon.

1127
01:22:14,187 --> 01:22:15,859
- How's that for service?
- Where is he?

1128
01:22:16,227 --> 01:22:19,264
His car is in his own garage in Calross Mews.

1129
01:22:20,107 --> 01:22:22,018
- Full of surprises, isn't he?.
- Shall I come with you?

1130
01:22:22,067 --> 01:22:23,420
No, you'd better stay here
if you don't mind.

1131
01:22:32,507 --> 01:22:34,577
So you finally got the gun back, eh?

1132
01:22:35,827 --> 01:22:38,864
So your great Scotland Yard
finally threw in the sponge, eh?

1133
01:22:40,387 --> 01:22:44,175
You got everything figured out,
right down to the last detail.

1134
01:22:44,387 --> 01:22:48,744
Yes , Kronin. In all humility,
I honestly believe I have.

1135
01:22:49,667 --> 01:22:52,227
Well, what are you waiting for?

1136
01:22:54,427 --> 01:22:58,306
You've got everything figured out
except one little thing, haven't you?

1137
01:23:01,187 --> 01:23:05,977
And that's how to do it...
You can't do it, can you.

1138
01:23:06,827 --> 01:23:11,981
When it comes down to it, you're nothing
but a blowhard and a big talker.

1139
01:23:14,987 --> 01:23:16,625
You haven't killed me yet!

1140
01:23:17,707 --> 01:23:21,461
Yes I have...it was in the martinis.

1141
01:23:29,947 --> 01:23:31,744
The martinis...

1142
01:23:33,587 --> 01:23:38,138
No, no!

1143
01:23:49,947 --> 01:23:50,936
No!

1144
01:23:52,467 --> 01:23:53,456
No! I won't!

1145
01:23:56,227 --> 01:23:57,342
Got to...keep...walking.

1146
01:24:42,267 --> 01:24:46,897
The joke's on you pal...
take a look at the bath!

1147
01:25:07,947 --> 01:25:12,065
You've got a body on your hands.

1148
01:25:12,267 --> 01:25:13,382
Not for long.

1149
01:25:38,787 --> 01:25:40,459
- Good evening, constable.
- Good evening, sir.

1150
01:25:53,547 --> 01:25:57,586
- This is it, sir...I locked it, sir.
- Was it open?

1151
01:25:57,707 --> 01:26:00,983
It was open sir...I pulled it to...
I thought the owner had forgotten it.

1152
01:26:01,187 --> 01:26:02,905
- Where's the car?
- Inside, sir.

1153
01:26:04,227 --> 01:26:07,697
- Have you locked the car...inside?
- Yes, sir.

1154
01:26:31,867 --> 01:26:34,017
- Well, where is it?
- In there. He locked the door.

1155
01:26:34,227 --> 01:26:36,582
And now he thinks the car is inside,
but he's not sure.

1156
01:26:36,707 --> 01:26:37,742
Break in!

1157
01:26:53,387 --> 01:26:55,696
- Well, the doctor's not here.
- What do we do?

1158
01:26:56,147 --> 01:26:59,059
Clear our cars away, and hang around here
in case he shows up.

1159
01:26:59,267 --> 01:27:01,064
I'll go and take a look
in his consulting room.

1160
01:27:03,467 --> 01:27:05,935
- That's funny!
- This is the switch here..

1161
01:27:08,787 --> 01:27:11,506
- What's this one for?
- Power I suppose.

1162
01:27:13,587 --> 01:27:15,305
Amateurish looking job, isn't it?

1163
01:27:15,947 --> 01:27:19,064
- Where do you suppose those lead to/
- Let's take a look.

1164
01:28:01,907 --> 01:28:03,818
Constable...the torch.

1165
01:28:30,307 --> 01:28:31,456
Come on chaps...break it in!

1166
01:28:50,547 --> 01:28:51,547
Doctor!

1167
01:29:06,667 --> 01:29:09,227
Excuse me sir...will there be
anything more tonight sir?

1168
01:29:09,427 --> 01:29:10,826
No, I'm waiting for someone.

1169
01:29:12,947 --> 01:29:14,426
Show that gentleman over here, will you.

1170
01:29:16,307 --> 01:29:17,342
That's alright.

1171
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:24,819
- Good evening Mr Finsbury...you're late!
- I'm sorry...I was detained.

1172
01:29:25,587 --> 01:29:28,784
- Do sit down, please.
- Thanks.

1173
01:29:31,187 --> 01:29:35,021
- You see, I was expecting you.
- I'm on duty, I'm afraid.

1174
01:29:36,707 --> 01:29:39,858
- We've found your dog.
- Congratulations.

1175
01:29:39,907 --> 01:29:40,673
One moment.

1176
01:29:42,383 --> 01:29:43,739
Don't worry.

1177
01:29:43,739 --> 01:29:48,096
If that were my intention...one quick bite...

1178
01:29:48,178 --> 01:29:49,462
...would be much easier.

1179
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:56,903
So you win after all, Mr Finsbury...
I still think it was a good idea though.

1180
01:29:57,267 --> 01:29:59,383
They always are.

1181
01:30:00,307 --> 01:30:03,504
You know, now that it's all over,
I can see my mistake, clearly.

1182
01:30:04,147 --> 01:30:04,916
You can?

1183
01:30:04,916 --> 01:30:07,751
A fundamental mistake
that grew into an obsession.

1184
01:30:08,747 --> 01:30:12,342
I felt the only way out of the situation
between my wife and myself...

1185
01:30:13,147 --> 01:30:15,342
...was to kill the next man
that made love to her.

1186
01:30:16,627 --> 01:30:19,016
- Are you married, mr Finsbury?
- No.

1187
01:30:20,787 --> 01:30:22,206
I've often thought about it.

1188
01:30:22,206 --> 01:30:25,886
The trouble is, I've thought about it so long,
I'm afraid I've missed the bus.

1189
01:30:25,987 --> 01:30:28,182
Just one of life's little jokes, isn't it?

1190
01:30:28,787 --> 01:30:31,699
it points out our mistakes too late
for us to profit by them.

1191
01:30:39,827 --> 01:30:42,421
Thanks.
It might interest you to know

1192
01:30:42,627 --> 01:30:45,585
...that you're the only clever
would-be murderer I've come across,

1193
01:30:45,707 --> 01:30:47,743
...who's in a position
to profit by his mistakes.

1194
01:30:48,507 --> 01:30:50,623
It'd be interesting to know
how much you've learned.

1195
01:30:51,347 --> 01:30:56,375
Bill Kronin is alive.
Just barely...but alive.

1196
01:30:58,827 --> 01:30:59,976
Shall we be getting along?

1197
01:31:01,027 --> 01:31:04,178
I forget...what's the penalty
for a near miss?

1198
01:31:04,627 --> 01:31:08,097
Oh, it varies.  In any case
they won't chain you up, you know.

1199
01:31:15,267 --> 01:31:18,065
Some visitors for you...
You may go in, Mrs Riordan.

1200
01:31:20,467 --> 01:31:23,618
Hello there, Storm...
this is a surprise!

1201
01:31:25,227 --> 01:31:27,695
- Hola, Monty.
- How are you, Bill?

1202
01:31:28,227 --> 01:31:31,537
Coming along fine...should be
out of here in a few days.

1203
01:31:31,787 --> 01:31:32,856
I'm so glad.

1204
01:31:34,027 --> 01:31:38,498
Bill, I expect you've wondered why
I haven't been in to see you before.

1205
01:31:38,987 --> 01:31:41,547
- No I haven't been wondering.
- The shock, and everything.

1206
01:31:42,387 --> 01:31:43,661
- Oh, sure.
- Clive, you know.

1207
01:31:43,827 --> 01:31:45,041
Yes, sure.

1208
01:31:45,041 --> 01:31:47,366
I thought I'd like to drop in
to see how you were.

1209
01:31:47,707 --> 01:31:48,953
Oh, I'm fine.

1210
01:31:48,953 --> 01:31:50,746
And to say goodbye.

1211
01:31:51,467 --> 01:31:53,503
Goodbye...you're going away?

1212
01:31:53,587 --> 01:31:56,818
My doctors want me to take a holiday,
so I'm going on a long sea trip.

1213
01:31:57,267 --> 01:32:00,003
Oh, swell!
Where are you going?

1214
01:32:00,003 --> 01:32:02,102
South America...Mexico...

1215
01:32:02,387 --> 01:32:05,902
Oh, you'll love Mexico!
Going alone?

1216
01:32:06,307 --> 01:32:10,181
No, Monty's coming with me,
of course.

1217
01:32:10,181 --> 01:32:12,041
Oh, Monty...yes!

1218
01:32:12,076 --> 01:32:13,863
You'll find he's a wonderful companion.

1219
01:32:14,627 --> 01:32:16,769
When we get back, we really must
get together again.

1220
01:32:16,769 --> 01:32:18,115
Yes, we must.

1221
01:32:18,147 --> 01:32:19,773
I'll leave it with you
to get in touch with me.

1222
01:32:19,773 --> 01:32:21,611
Yes, you leave it to me.

1223
01:32:21,611 --> 01:32:23,459
Oh, I love you!
I really must go now.

1224
01:32:21,787 --> 01:32:25,063
I have a hair appointment.

1225
01:32:25,267 --> 01:32:26,461
Mustn't be late for that!

1226
01:32:28,467 --> 01:32:30,378
- 'Bye, Bill.
- Goodbye, Storm.

1227
01:32:31,027 --> 01:32:32,585
Think of me sometimes!

1228
01:32:33,547 --> 01:32:36,380
I have an idea I'll not forget you
as long as I live.

1229
01:32:48,707 --> 01:32:50,504
Monty, come here!

1230
