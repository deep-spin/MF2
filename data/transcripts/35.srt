1
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,943
<i>Dense forest once
covered all of Piney Ridge,</i>

2
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,865
<i>but no longer is the
region a mystery.</i>

3
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,980
<i>Modern highways have
penetrated the darkness,</i>

4
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:25,981
<i>and brought in the light.</i>

5
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,705
<i>Not so in Ox Head
Woods, further south.</i>

6
00:01:29,095 --> 00:01:31,546
<i>Step into it off the abandoned
road that hugs its length,</i>

7
00:01:31,547 --> 00:01:36,231
<i>and it's like passing through a wall
and closing the door behind you.</i>

8
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:42,244
<i>Obsolete trails wonder vaguely, crisscross,
or break at right angles for no reason.</i>

9
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,403
<i>Only one leads to
the Morgan farm.</i>

10
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,461
<i>Pete Morgan's farm has
the allure of a wall castle</i>

11
00:01:49,462 --> 00:01:53,262
<i>that everybody knows about,
but few have entered.</i>

12
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:58,939
<i>Its only access to the outside world
is a country road that passes by.</i>

13
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:02,683
<i>Some miles north connects with
the highway near the Renton farm.</i>

14
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,182
<i>Joe Renton, like the other farmers
here abouts, is up and coming,</i>

15
00:02:07,183 --> 00:02:08,883
<i>raises good apples.</i>

16
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,390
<i>Fine soil everywhere
in the valley.</i>

17
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,745
<i>The young people for miles
around come to the high school.</i>

18
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,023
<i>The boys graduate a little older
than those in the city.</i>

19
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,646
<i>That's because they take time out for
planting and helping with the harvest.</i>

20
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,399
<i>They're a healthy lot.</i>

21
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,846
<i>And girls don't come
prettier any place.</i>

22
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,663
Are we going swimming Sunday?

23
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,949
Sure, if I'm not
needed at the store.

24
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,328
Where do you change into
your swimming trunks?

25
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:55,999
Mmm, maybe I'll wear them over.

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,386
No.

27
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,741
Bring them.
We'll change at the reservoir.

28
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:02,639
Who else is coming?

29
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,240
Just us.

30
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,028
<i>Hi Teller,
how's hunting?</i>

31
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,107
Bye, kids. Miss me.

32
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,626
What are you doing so
close to civilization?

33
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,619
You're growing up, Tibby.

34
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,603
- You're almost a woman.
- Almost! I'm woman enough already.

35
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,131
I wouldn't say that.

36
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,150
Oh, what do you know about anything,
you never got past the ninth grade.

37
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,746
I'm good at plenty of things
they don't teach in school.

38
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,760
What's got into you, Meg?
You got the fidgets?

39
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:16,819
I promised Pete Morgan I'd bring you by the farm
this afternoon, and I don't know how to ask you.

40
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,724
Looks like you've
asked me already.

41
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,624
What does he want?

42
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,464
You better ask him.

43
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:24,499
Well, how long will it take?

44
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,247
Not too awfully long, Nath.

45
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,242
We're here already.

46
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,060
OK, Meg, let's go.

47
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,360
Hey, Nath, what's Tibby
going to say about this?

48
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:44,961
<i>What do you think she'll do?</i>

49
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,889
Pete?

50
00:05:09,114 --> 00:05:10,559
Yes, Meg.

51
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,331
I brought Nath Storm,
the boy I told you about.

52
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,580
You know, I've...

53
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:30,081
I've thought
about this thing, Meg.

54
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,209
I'm not so sure
it's a good thing.

55
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,646
We've been content with
the way things were.

56
00:05:36,015 --> 00:05:38,136
Maybe an outsider will spoil it.

57
00:05:38,737 --> 00:05:43,819
But it would be so much easier for you if Nath
would come and help out at the end of the day.

58
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,622
- Anything between you and Nath?
- Oh, no.

59
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,784
He and Tibby Renton
are going steady.

60
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,029
All right, I'll see the boy.

61
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,470
Never could turn
you down, could I?

62
00:06:13,962 --> 00:06:16,669
Meg says good things
about you, Nath.

63
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,759
Maybe you're not as
stocky as you might be.

64
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,871
Stopped growing too
soon, Mr. Morgan.

65
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,484
- How's your mother's store getting along?
- Oh well, some days we don't even make a $1.

66
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,488
What did you want to see
me about, Mr. Morgan?

67
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,224
You know about my leg?

68
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,509
Wood.

69
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,809
My sister and Meg have
got a curious idea that

70
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,510
it's hard to climb a ladder
with a wooden leg.

71
00:06:45,797 --> 00:06:47,497
- Well, it isn't.
- No, sir.

72
00:06:47,498 --> 00:06:52,281
What's more, they've got an idea that
things are getting a little run down here,

73
00:06:52,282 --> 00:06:54,171
can't do as much as I used to.

74
00:06:54,172 --> 00:06:56,739
So they've talked me
into hiring somebody.

75
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,281
Eh, help along with
the evening chores.

76
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,011
I'll pay $0.35 an hour.

77
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,906
Could you make it 4 bits?

78
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:12,716
It's over an hour's
walk home afterwards.

79
00:07:13,117 --> 00:07:15,799
Yeah, I hadn't thought of that.

80
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,787
- I'll pay $0.50 a hour.
- Could he start today?

81
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,590
- Sure it's all right with you, Meg?
- Oh, yes.

82
00:07:28,591 --> 00:07:30,191
Thanks!

83
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,540
<i>Come on, Nath.</i>

84
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,947
Ellen?

85
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,507
Ellen!

86
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,966
- He's hired Nath.
- Good.

87
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:54,459
I just hope that Pete hasn't become
too used to doing things alone.

88
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,927
I do hope it works out.

89
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:21,175
- You sure you don't want any more, Nath?
- No, thanks, ma'am.

90
00:08:21,676 --> 00:08:24,739
Bet nobody'll believe me when
I tell them I had supper here.

91
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,930
Why not, Nath?

92
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,865
Well, didn't you know you
and Miss Ellen are known as...

93
00:08:29,866 --> 00:08:31,837
the mysterious Morgans?

94
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:34,279
Are we?

95
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,681
Well, they won't
say it anymore.

96
00:08:35,755 --> 00:08:38,386
Not when I tell them what a
swell layout you've got here.

97
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:40,791
And that you spread the
best table in the valley.

98
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:43,594
It's because we're so
self-sufficient here.

99
00:08:43,895 --> 00:08:46,699
We seldom have any
need to go to town.

100
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,583
What else do they
say about us, Nath?

101
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,647
Oh, nothing.

102
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,240
Except things like...

103
00:08:56,241 --> 00:08:58,441
Meg not being your daughter,

104
00:08:58,442 --> 00:09:00,142
or even related.

105
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,550
Why don't they ask me?

106
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:08,740
Well I... I guess they'd rather whisper
gossip than find out the truth.

107
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:10,641
What gossip?

108
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,980
Well, they say...

109
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:18,981
Meg's mother and father ran away
and left her when she was still a baby.

110
00:09:19,604 --> 00:09:21,825
Well, that's not true, Nath.

111
00:09:21,826 --> 00:09:24,957
Meg's mother and father went
down south to find a new farm.

112
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,367
- They left Meg in our care.
- They died down there in a runaway.

113
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:32,853
Pete and I adopted Meg legally. There's
nothing to be whispered about, Nath.

114
00:09:32,854 --> 00:09:34,399
She was only two
years old then.

115
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,848
There's nothing wrong
with being adopted.

116
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,941
I'm grateful.

117
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:40,942
Sure.

118
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,123
And the next time I hear anybody
gossiping about it, I'll say, so what?

119
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,889
Meg isn't the only
adopted girl in the world.

120
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:06,384
Well, I... I hate to eat and run, folks,
but... I think I better get started.

121
00:10:17,832 --> 00:10:21,999
It's kind of late so I thought I'd take
a shortcut through Ox Head Woods.

122
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,207
- You know your way through those woods?
- No, but the winds cleared the sky.

123
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:31,390
Well, I'd take the long
way around if I were you.

124
00:10:31,691 --> 00:10:35,173
I've owned the Ox Head
Woods for years and...

125
00:10:35,574 --> 00:10:39,642
I'm as brave as the next man, but I wouldn't
cross through those woods at night.

126
00:10:39,643 --> 00:10:42,269
The woods haven't scared
me since I was a kid.

127
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,393
- Day or night.
- But you said you didn't know Ox Head Woods.

128
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,439
- A tree is a tree, and a trail is a trail.
- The trails lead nowhere.

129
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,704
- Let the boy go, Pete.
- I don't want him to get lost.

130
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,679
- Close the door, Pete.
- I don't want him to get hurt.

131
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,911
Wait, don't take the Ox Head Woods.
The foot bridge across the creek is out.

132
00:10:59,912 --> 00:11:01,759
- I'll jump across.
- Well there's bog on the other side.

133
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,105
I'll find my way around it.
Look, Mr. Morgan, I can't...

134
00:11:04,106 --> 00:11:07,029
- It's a long way around.
- I'll save two miles by cutting through the woods.

135
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:11,039
But you won't save yourself from the screams
in the night, It'll lodge in your bones all your life.

136
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,790
- Screams from where?
- From the red house.

137
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,722
Well, if I come to it,
I'll give it a wide go by.

138
00:11:19,723 --> 00:11:21,423
You can't!

139
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,363
Did you ever run
away from the scream?

140
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,483
Hey Nath!

141
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,121
It will follow you
through the woods.

142
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,610
It will follow you
all of your life.

143
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,006
Nath! Nath!

144
00:12:36,931 --> 00:12:39,302
What did you say to him?

145
00:12:39,303 --> 00:12:41,865
Nath's a brave lad,
but he's fooled.

146
00:12:41,866 --> 00:12:44,292
I warned him but
he wouldn't listen.

147
00:12:44,593 --> 00:12:47,039
You warned him against what?

148
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,348
Courage isn't enough.

149
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,405
He won't make it.

150
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,661
He'll be back.

151
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,265
He'll be back.

152
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,900
Yes, Mrs. Storm, Nath's sleeping here
tonight, so don't you worry about it.

153
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:52,599
Hard work and a big
supper never hurt any boy.

154
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,928
Oh, don't you mention it,
we're glad to have him.

155
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,620
Good night.

156
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,165
How did you know he was back?

157
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,960
Nath's all right.

158
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,184
He's going to be a
great help on the farm.

159
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,911
How did you happen
to get in here?

160
00:16:47,037 --> 00:16:48,807
I ran here.

161
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,174
You scared the daylights
out of me last night.

162
00:16:52,975 --> 00:16:56,696
Seems like the truth shouldn't
scare anybody. Man or boy.

163
00:16:56,697 --> 00:16:58,278
The truth?

164
00:16:58,279 --> 00:17:01,924
- You and your screams in the night almost...
- What are you talking about?

165
00:17:03,225 --> 00:17:05,905
Now, don't tell me I
imagined all that stuff?

166
00:17:05,906 --> 00:17:07,695
I went in those words
and I heard things.

167
00:17:07,696 --> 00:17:09,899
- What things?
- I don't know.

168
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,046
I don't know whether it was the screams
you were talking about or... just the wind.

169
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,708
You leave well
enough alone, son.

170
00:17:19,175 --> 00:17:20,839
Go in and wash up.

171
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,742
Join us for breakfast, and you can
catch the school bus with Meg.

172
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,503
What kind of a guy
is Pete anyway?

173
00:17:41,097 --> 00:17:43,179
He's always been
wonderful to me.

174
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:45,323
And kind and generous.

175
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,065
For my last birthday, he sent to the city

176
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:51,395
and bought me the most wonderful
furniture he could buy for my room.

177
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,983
He's always been that way.

178
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,569
But... what about
that red house?

179
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:04,629
I remember hearing him talk
about it a long time ago.

180
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,687
But I've never heard
him mention it since.

181
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,388
- You haven't?
- No.

182
00:18:10,735 --> 00:18:14,819
He's just warned me to stay out
of those woods, since I was little.

183
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,768
Do you know anything
about those screams?

184
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,849
I don't know, Nath.
I may be afraid to find out.

185
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,487
Hey, look whose
moved in with the Morgans.

186
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:40,580
OK, so I'm working there,
so make something out of it.

187
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,780
Well,

188
00:19:01,852 --> 00:19:04,152
you've got nerve,
Nath Storm.

189
00:19:04,153 --> 00:19:07,059
Where were you last night when
I phoned like I said I would?

190
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,610
- Working.
- Working?

191
00:19:09,611 --> 00:19:11,138
All night long?

192
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,709
Ah, Tibby, can't a guy even
earn chore money at the Morgans

193
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:17,257
- without you throwing a fit?
- Not if it takes all night.

194
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,467
Hi, mom.

195
00:19:54,424 --> 00:19:56,775
I see you're not bowled over
by the rush of business.

196
00:19:56,776 --> 00:19:59,399
Oh, things have been
like this all day again.

197
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,551
I suppose folks get tired coming
and asking for things I haven't got.

198
00:20:04,385 --> 00:20:05,711
Look, mom.

199
00:20:05,712 --> 00:20:08,199
Why don't you close the
store and marry Don Brant.

200
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,170
He's a nice guy.

201
00:20:10,216 --> 00:20:14,539
Now there's time enough for Don and me to get
married after you're out of school and on your own.

202
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,171
Graduation's just
around the corner.

203
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,241
Why don't you two go and get married while
you're still young enough to enjoy it?

204
00:20:23,304 --> 00:20:26,972
Shame on you, talking
to your mother that way.

205
00:20:26,973 --> 00:20:29,679
Well, you've given
enough your life to me.

206
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,480
You go down to town and tell
Don you're ready anytime he is.

207
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,709
He's being transferred north.

208
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,441
Well, that settles it.

209
00:20:38,442 --> 00:20:41,632
Here he's been courting you
since I was in grammar school.

210
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:44,776
If you don't marry him now,
he'll meet some chick up north,

211
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:48,279
and then you'll be a dead duck.

212
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,565
Well, I've got to change.
I'll be late at the Morgans.

213
00:20:52,201 --> 00:20:55,168
- How do you like it up there?
- Oh, it's OK.

214
00:20:55,169 --> 00:20:57,878
<i>They eat good.
I mean, well.</i>

215
00:20:57,879 --> 00:21:00,283
<i>A couple of things
got me wondering.</i>

216
00:21:00,284 --> 00:21:02,669
How did Pete Morgan
lose his leg?

217
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,877
He fell down a cliff
in the Ox Head Woods.

218
00:21:04,878 --> 00:21:07,759
It was a long time ago,
you were still a baby.

219
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,445
It was Dr. Burns first
case in the valley.

220
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:13,993
He amputated the leg on
the Morgan kitchen table.

221
00:21:13,994 --> 00:21:16,581
I wonder if it's
the one I ate at.

222
00:21:16,582 --> 00:21:20,548
That was the first time Dr.
Burn ever met Ellen Morgan.

223
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:24,013
Everybody knew he fell in love with her,
but nothing ever came of it.

224
00:21:24,014 --> 00:21:27,895
- I wonder why. He's still a bachelor.
- I don't know.

225
00:21:27,896 --> 00:21:31,658
They still act like they love each other,
the few times I've seen them meet.

226
00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:35,959
But she chose to devote her life
to her brother Pete, I guess.

227
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,646
Seems a shame.

228
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:41,466
Just like it would be a shame if you
don't marry Don and go north with him.

229
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:45,067
If I do, how long will it be before
you and Tibby get married?

230
00:21:45,068 --> 00:21:46,808
Oh, search me.

231
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:50,579
Sometimes the more I know about women,
the less I know about women.

232
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,689
Guy needs more than a high school education
just to find out what they're going to do next.

233
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,275
Will you be staying at
the Morgans again tonight?

234
00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:58,499
No.

235
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,104
I'm going to take a shortcut through
Ox Head Woods by daylight,

236
00:22:01,105 --> 00:22:03,034
so I'll know my way
back here tonight.

237
00:22:03,078 --> 00:22:05,021
Well, if you should
change your mind,

238
00:22:05,022 --> 00:22:09,522
would you care if I go down to town,
and talk things over Don?

239
00:22:09,523 --> 00:22:11,810
You do more than
talk things over.

240
00:22:11,811 --> 00:22:14,139
You come back here a bride.

241
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:17,940
We don't want any dead ducks
in the family, do we?

242
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,867
How are the hens doing?

243
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,044
We always have more
eggs than we can use.

244
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,920
Meg?

245
00:24:02,538 --> 00:24:05,840
I guess Nath asked a lot of questions
on the way to school this morning.

246
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:09,121
Yes, but only questions
I've wondered about myself.

247
00:24:09,122 --> 00:24:11,632
Things you've never explained.

248
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:13,719
Can't you tell me, Pete?

249
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:17,220
Well, I didn't know that
anything covered you.

250
00:24:18,339 --> 00:24:20,948
Why are you suddenly
questioning things?

251
00:24:20,949 --> 00:24:23,039
Because of him?

252
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,122
Maybe.

253
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:29,508
Well, maybe he won't come back.

254
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,299
I think he will.

255
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,187
I hope he does.

256
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,648
All of a sudden you
seem so grown up.

257
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,642
And I guess I don't
like to see it happen.

258
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,611
I wish you were a child again.

259
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,904
I wish you needed me
just as you did then.

260
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:01,899
I don't want you ever
to grow away from us.

261
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,865
You mean everything
to Ellen and me.

262
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:07,739
I want you to be happy.

263
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,965
I love you both very much.

264
00:25:36,172 --> 00:25:37,919
You're late today.

265
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,938
I had to go home first.

266
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:42,319
I came here through
Ox Head Woods.

267
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,144
Yes, that would be
the quickest. Day times.

268
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,570
Or any other time.

269
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:54,566
Don't put so high a price
on courage, son. It's overrated.

270
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,511
The lowest animals got
more courage than man has.

271
00:25:58,534 --> 00:26:02,662
You touch a snapping turtle with a
stick and he grabs at it with his teeth.

272
00:26:02,663 --> 00:26:04,163
Cut his head off,

273
00:26:04,164 --> 00:26:08,164
and he...
he still won't let go.

274
00:26:08,165 --> 00:26:11,765
Now, we humans
weren't made that way.

275
00:26:12,066 --> 00:26:13,856
We were born helpless.

276
00:26:13,857 --> 00:26:18,205
But we don't have to stay that way.
Nobody's gonna call me yellow.

277
00:26:18,206 --> 00:26:19,815
Who has?

278
00:26:19,816 --> 00:26:21,859
Nobody, yet.

279
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,761
And nobody's going to.

280
00:28:22,014 --> 00:28:25,598
- Has he been outside tonight?
- No.

281
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:27,563
Give me your word.

282
00:28:27,564 --> 00:28:28,970
Of course.

283
00:28:28,971 --> 00:28:33,019
Why, you're soaked through, Nath.
Get a blanket from the chest, Meg.

284
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,622
You can stay in
the helper's cabin.

285
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:38,258
I warned you.

286
00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:40,109
But you wouldn't listen.

287
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:43,631
It wasn't a piece of that red house
that knocked me into the stream, Mr. Morgan.

288
00:28:43,632 --> 00:28:45,899
And it wasn't a scream in the
night that bowled me over.

289
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:49,568
It was a human, a human strong
enough to nearly killed me.

290
00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:51,591
I figured it was you.

291
00:28:53,793 --> 00:28:58,193
Sometimes we figure too
much, son, the wrong things.

292
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:01,059
Things that can't
ever be figured.

293
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,964
And it's bad, bad for everyone.

294
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,088
It's quicksand.

295
00:29:06,969 --> 00:29:09,479
I need your help here, Nath.

296
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,870
Why would I want to hurt you?

297
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,180
What do you think
happened, Pete?

298
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,966
There's a curse on those woods.

299
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,227
We know that.

300
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,967
Are you going to
stay with us, Nath?

301
00:30:04,222 --> 00:30:07,709
- Why shouldn't I?
- Well, after what's happened, I thought...

302
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:10,519
and Tibby doesn't
want you to, does she?

303
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:17,303
After what's happened, you couldn't get me
out of here with a triple barreled shotgun.

304
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,987
Last night I was a coward.

305
00:30:21,837 --> 00:30:25,699
There's some connection between
Pete's red house and whoever hit me.

306
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,081
I'm going to find out what goes on
out there if it takes exploring

307
00:30:28,082 --> 00:30:30,189
every Sunday between now and doomsday.

308
00:30:30,212 --> 00:30:32,219
I'll help you.

309
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,043
I thought Pete told you
not to go in those woods.

310
00:30:35,044 --> 00:30:37,188
I can't help it, I want to.

311
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,985
OK.

312
00:30:38,986 --> 00:30:41,287
Sunday we'll go prowling.

313
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,511
What about your
date with Tibby?

314
00:30:54,512 --> 00:30:56,938
I want her to be
sure that...

315
00:30:56,939 --> 00:31:00,439
that I don't want you to stay
here just because...

316
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:05,222
I mean, I don't want her to think
I'm trying to steal you away from her.

317
00:31:05,223 --> 00:31:07,671
We did have a date to go
swimming Sunday anyway.

318
00:31:07,672 --> 00:31:11,383
So maybe asking her to come along would
keep her from throwing another fit.

319
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:16,261
- Goodnight, Nath, and thanks.
- Goodnight, Meg.

320
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,162
Help me down, honey.

321
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:49,382
- Don't drop me.
- Drop you? Who's got hold of who?

322
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,649
Hey, kids.

323
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:04,185
I found an old trail,
maybe it leads somewhere.

324
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:07,367
- Another dead end.
- They're all dead ends, I'm hot.

325
00:33:30,472 --> 00:33:33,862
We've been on a wild goose
chase for four solid hours.

326
00:33:33,863 --> 00:33:36,694
Find your haunted
house on your own time.

327
00:33:36,695 --> 00:33:38,699
You're on my time now.

328
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,331
Or have you forgotten we had a
date to go swimming this afternoon?

329
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,461
Just the two of us...

330
00:33:44,462 --> 00:33:46,462
remember?

331
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,285
Let's go back to the farm, kids.
The sun'll be just right for swimming.

332
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,764
Nath! What's happened to you?

333
00:34:00,765 --> 00:34:03,316
Why, what's the matter?

334
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:06,222
Well, there's a black and blue
streak across your shoulder.

335
00:34:06,223 --> 00:34:08,684
- How'd you get it?
- Oh, that!

336
00:34:08,685 --> 00:34:11,928
- I.. I don't know.
- Of course you know.

337
00:34:12,812 --> 00:34:14,896
You might let me
in on your secrets.

338
00:34:14,897 --> 00:34:16,861
We haven't any secrets.

339
00:34:16,862 --> 00:34:18,632
We told you about the red house.

340
00:34:18,633 --> 00:34:23,339
Look, Tibby, I, uh, I slipped in the stream
last night and fell on my shoulder.

341
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,551
- Come on, I'll race you across the pond.
- Aren't you coming in?

342
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,247
You had a swimming date,
just the two of you, remember?

343
00:34:30,248 --> 00:34:32,048
I'll sun.

344
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,120
Winner!

345
00:35:23,483 --> 00:35:25,772
- Do you love me?
- Sure.

346
00:35:25,773 --> 00:35:28,419
<i>Just keep me well kissed.</i>

347
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,526
<i>I like to be kissed.</i>

348
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:45,128
Hey, lovebirds, dinner's ready!

349
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,246
Are you and Nath planning
to be married, Tibby?

350
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,746
Well, I like to keep
him guessing, Mr. Morgan.

351
00:36:02,747 --> 00:36:06,232
She's like an ornery heifer
sometimes, hard to hold down.

352
00:36:07,033 --> 00:36:09,754
We're glad to have
you at our house, Tibby.

353
00:36:09,755 --> 00:36:13,056
We've missed having company,
you must come back often.

354
00:36:13,057 --> 00:36:16,157
Besides, we like
to keep Nath happy.

355
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:18,642
We had a pleasant day?

356
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:23,891
Well, we wasted most of it looking for a
haunted house in the Ox Head Woods.

357
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,881
I didn't know there was a haunted
house in the Ox Head Woods.

358
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:37,381
Well, Nath says it's red and he's
got to find it. Isn't that silly?

359
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,247
Yes, it is.

360
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,067
Meg go with you?

361
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,801
Seems there's enough trouble in this world
without having to go out and look for it.

362
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,631
Well, I'm all the trouble he
can handle if he only knew it.

363
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:17,090
Well, that's a well one you are
keeping a secret, blabbing to Pete.

364
00:37:17,091 --> 00:37:19,094
I didn't blab, it just slipped out.

365
00:37:19,095 --> 00:37:22,661
And a fine swimming date
we had, I don't think.

366
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,850
You know, Tibby,

367
00:37:24,851 --> 00:37:28,178
you're might pretty,
especially when you're mad.

368
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:31,167
And I guess maybe,
maybe when you're mad,

369
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,983
you're just about the
prettiest gal there is.

370
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,881
Are you sure you don't want me to get
Pete's pickup truck and drive you home?

371
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:42,132
Can't have your
cake and eat it too.

372
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,742
You have chores to do.

373
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,944
I'll walk home, thanks.

374
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,028
Don't suppose I'll be seeing
much of you weeknights.

375
00:37:52,029 --> 00:37:55,260
Well, what with final exams
coming up and this new job...

376
00:37:55,261 --> 00:37:56,950
I know.

377
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,263
Would it be too much to ask that
we spend next Sunday by ourselves?

378
00:38:01,264 --> 00:38:02,811
Just you and me?

379
00:38:02,812 --> 00:38:06,079
Or is it more important to play
hide and seek in the woods with Meg?

380
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,164
Go on, get madder.

381
00:38:08,165 --> 00:38:10,251
It makes your cheeks pink.

382
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,451
Don't think you're going to
talk me into a kiss goodbye.

383
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,889
I want you to miss 'em,

384
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:22,890
long enough to make them more
important than... haunted houses.

385
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,047
So save it for next Sunday.

386
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,082
I thought you
were napping, Pete.

387
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,202
You disobeyed me.

388
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,524
Now you listen to me.

389
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,348
I'm listening.

390
00:38:58,727 --> 00:39:00,138
You went into the
woods with Nath.

391
00:39:00,139 --> 00:39:03,539
- Well, why shouldn't I, there only...
- Because I've asked you not to.

392
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:07,646
We didn't find anything, all we did was keep
getting into one dead end after another.

393
00:39:07,647 --> 00:39:10,491
I don't care,
now you listen to me.

394
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,762
All I have in the world is you.

395
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:17,665
If there's anything you want, I'll get it for you,
But there's one thing you've got to do for me.

396
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:19,911
You stay out of those woods!

397
00:39:19,912 --> 00:39:22,454
I've grown up, and I've got
a right to do as I please.

398
00:39:22,455 --> 00:39:25,579
I've never laid hands on you in my life.

399
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,001
But I'll take the
whip to you if you do!

400
00:39:28,002 --> 00:39:29,702
Pete!

401
00:40:02,673 --> 00:40:04,262
Hi, Teller.

402
00:40:04,263 --> 00:40:06,691
- Headed for home?
- Uh-huh.

403
00:40:06,692 --> 00:40:11,259
- That's what I figured. You been swimming?
- How'd you know?

404
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:14,211
Got your suit in
that bag, haven't you?

405
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:18,139
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.

406
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,946
What for?

407
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:23,487
I want you to do me a favor.

408
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:27,359
You've got looks and
all the rest besides.

409
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,249
Besides that, I figure
you're the kind that's got

410
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,721
more sense in your head
than comes out of your mouth.

411
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,270
Maybe I have.

412
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:38,260
What kind of favor
you want out of me?

413
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,531
I've got 750 bucks.

414
00:40:43,456 --> 00:40:45,379
I want you to buy me
a government bond.

415
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:49,322
$750, where'd you get it,
you steal it?

416
00:40:50,955 --> 00:40:53,039
I want you to buy me that bond.

417
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,685
Have them write my name on it and
buy it the next time you go to town.

418
00:40:57,754 --> 00:40:59,279
There's an extra $10
for your trouble.

419
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,102
- Oh I couldn't take money...
- Sure, you could.

420
00:41:02,546 --> 00:41:05,689
And keep your
mouth shut to boot.

421
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:08,136
I'll be waiting every
Sunday till you bring it.

422
00:41:08,137 --> 00:41:10,619
Why don't you buy it yourself.

423
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:14,321
'Cause the guy in the village
bank's got too long a nose.

424
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,841
And because it'll be a prettier
bond if you buy it for me.

425
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,447
I better get home.

426
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,069
Do you want me to help
you cross the stream?

427
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,971
Thanks a lot, Teller.

428
00:42:00,092 --> 00:42:02,459
Is that all the thanks I get?

429
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,261
How much more do you want?

430
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,921
Teller.

431
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:00,420
You'll either protect these woods
of mine or I get someone who can.

432
00:43:00,421 --> 00:43:03,165
Oh, why don't you keep
your trespassers at home?

433
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:05,714
You gave me full rights to
the Ox Head Woods exclusive.

434
00:43:05,715 --> 00:43:08,419
I gave you the game rights in exchange
for keeping trespassers out.

435
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:12,221
Look, Mr. Morgan, if you can't keep
your own hired hand out of these woods,

436
00:43:12,322 --> 00:43:15,643
maybe I should use more than a
club to scare him away with.

437
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,224
Oh, why don't you?

438
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,667
- You telling me I can use my gun?
- I don't want anybody to get hurt but...

439
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:28,469
there's no better way of backing up a No Trespassing
sign than by a bullet missing somebody's skull.

440
00:43:33,608 --> 00:43:37,055
OK, Mr. Morgan,
I'll take care of my end.

441
00:43:37,456 --> 00:43:40,864
- This is going to be fun.
- And it's going to be more than that.

442
00:43:40,865 --> 00:43:43,212
It's your last chance.

443
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,944
"Be kind one to another,

444
00:44:00,945 --> 00:44:03,711
tenderhearted, forgiving one another,

445
00:44:03,712 --> 00:44:07,912
even as God, for Christ's sake,
has forgiven you."

446
00:44:10,037 --> 00:44:13,959
Dear Heavenly Father,
we pray to thee

447
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,306
to bless all those on earth
who are suffering

448
00:44:17,307 --> 00:44:19,851
in heart and mind,

449
00:44:19,852 --> 00:44:22,052
body and spirit.

450
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:29,880
Grant them the blessing of
hope and faith and strength...

451
00:44:31,581 --> 00:44:33,281
and peace.

452
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:38,832
Amen.

453
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,222
What's troubling you, Pete?

454
00:44:48,223 --> 00:44:51,012
You haven't eaten,
you haven't slept.

455
00:45:10,325 --> 00:45:11,973
Hello?

456
00:45:12,374 --> 00:45:14,439
Yes Tibby, I'll call him.

457
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,110
Tibby wants you.

458
00:45:17,485 --> 00:45:19,549
Hello, Tibby.

459
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,279
No, I'm coming over.

460
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,509
Or you can use the
pickup truck, Nath.

461
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:27,004
Pete says I can use
his pickup truck.

462
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:28,724
I'll come on down.

463
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,447
Bye.

464
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,987
You know, when I was
a young man and in love,

465
00:45:33,988 --> 00:45:37,188
Sunday was always
a good day for spooning.

466
00:45:37,216 --> 00:45:39,899
Thanks for the
use of the truck.

467
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,482
Always ready to give love
a helping hand,

468
00:45:43,483 --> 00:45:45,483
aren't we, Meg?

469
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,007
That's right.

470
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,564
Now, I might add, it's a lot
healthier than prowling in woods.

471
00:46:08,023 --> 00:46:11,949
I don't care what Pete said, I wish
we were prowling in the woods today.

472
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:13,879
I wish Tibby'd
forgotten our date.

473
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,804
So do I.

474
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:19,579
There's something
out in those woods.

475
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:24,225
Something tells me we won't find out
what it is until I find the red house.

476
00:46:25,705 --> 00:46:29,027
What are we going to do
with it when we find it?

477
00:46:29,028 --> 00:46:32,079
Bust it open, I guess,
and let some light in.

478
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:35,687
Maybe it'll shake the creeps
out of a lot of things.

479
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,167
We'll find it.

480
00:47:04,168 --> 00:47:05,868
I, uh...

481
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,871
I got this for your graduation.

482
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,219
I wasn't going to give
it to you until then, but...

483
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:15,920
because it's a gray day and...

484
00:47:16,221 --> 00:47:18,621
because I want you to be happy...

485
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,720
I, uh...

486
00:47:21,521 --> 00:47:23,721
go ahead, open it.

487
00:47:33,894 --> 00:47:36,359
Oh, how beautiful!

488
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:39,909
- You like it?
- Oh, I love it.

489
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:43,129
Oh, uh, let me put it on, huh?

490
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,601
Now will you forgive me for
barking at you last Sunday?

491
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:02,157
I didn't exactly disobey, Pete.

492
00:48:02,158 --> 00:48:04,579
I've always wanted to
go into those woods.

493
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:07,711
I did it because
I felt I had to.

494
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:10,420
Strange.

495
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,742
I felt I belonged there.

496
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:17,664
Don't ever go near
those woods again.

497
00:48:29,915 --> 00:48:31,719
Thanks for the watch.

498
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,346
I'll treasure it all my life.

499
00:53:37,249 --> 00:53:39,219
Tibby, you've
got Meg all wrong.

500
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,941
Didn't she ask you up to
spend the day and have dinner?

501
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:43,494
Yeah, but why?

502
00:53:43,495 --> 00:53:46,456
Can't anybody do anything without
you figuring they've got an angle?

503
00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:49,499
I've always got an angle.
I've got an angle on you!

504
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:51,771
A girl always has a reason
when she does something.

505
00:53:51,797 --> 00:53:53,690
- Does she?
- Sure.

506
00:53:53,691 --> 00:53:55,038
OK.

507
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:58,124
And what's your reason for
dawdling with that guy Teller?

508
00:53:58,125 --> 00:54:01,050
- What do you mean dawdling?
- Just what I said.

509
00:54:01,051 --> 00:54:02,894
You think I didn't see you?

510
00:54:02,895 --> 00:54:05,295
How could you?
Where were you?

511
00:54:05,296 --> 00:54:06,946
In the bus.

512
00:54:06,947 --> 00:54:08,455
Where'd you think I was?

513
00:54:08,456 --> 00:54:10,557
Oh, that.

514
00:54:10,558 --> 00:54:12,039
Yes, that.

515
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:14,322
Was there some more dawdling
I didn't know about?

516
00:54:14,323 --> 00:54:17,910
You don't think I'd be interested in a
big dumb ox who makes his living hunting?

517
00:54:17,911 --> 00:54:20,901
Well, you were interested enough
to stop and talk to him that afternoon.

518
00:54:20,902 --> 00:54:24,047
Well, he was sitting on our rocks.
I told him to get off them.

519
00:54:24,048 --> 00:54:25,552
What did he say?

520
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,179
He said he would.

521
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,205
- I'll bet.
- You calling me a liar?

522
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,899
Now don't make something out of nothing.
All I said was, I'll bet.

523
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,299
- You bet what?
- I'll bet...

524
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,500
he said he'd get off your rocks.

525
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,961
Is that calling you a liar?

526
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,845
Pop was right.

527
00:54:47,846 --> 00:54:49,472
Right about what?

528
00:54:49,473 --> 00:54:53,937
You're too bright to be wasting your time
up at the Morgans' for four bits an hour.

529
00:54:53,938 --> 00:54:56,286
Well, they just
live off their farm.

530
00:54:56,287 --> 00:54:58,993
We make a profit on ours.

531
00:54:58,994 --> 00:55:02,357
Since when is there a law
against living off the earth?

532
00:55:02,358 --> 00:55:05,238
We're going to live
off the earth some day.

533
00:55:05,239 --> 00:55:08,725
Before we're finished, we're gonna
leave our kids a good farm.

534
00:55:09,126 --> 00:55:13,051
I want to clear out of these
hills when I get married.

535
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:15,499
- Since when?
- Since now.

536
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,279
I don't want to be
just any farm wife.

537
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:21,642
This is a good a time as
any other to find that out.

538
00:55:25,699 --> 00:55:29,999
Well, if you love someone,
you'll do anything for 'em.

539
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,402
That works both ways.

540
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:35,822
Maybe someday you'll
own this whole valley,

541
00:55:35,823 --> 00:55:38,629
and we can spend our
winters in the city house.

542
00:55:38,658 --> 00:55:40,139
Sure.

543
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:43,329
With two station
wagons and a limousine.

544
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,410
Why not?

545
00:55:47,566 --> 00:55:51,187
- I better get back to the Morgans'.
- What for?

546
00:55:51,188 --> 00:55:54,499
Let you go on with your dreaming.
I'm disturbing your sleep.

547
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:58,924
City house, station wagons,
limousines. Great.

548
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,927
Boy, when you dream,
you really dream good.

549
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,651
Well, aren't I
worth working for?

550
00:56:08,652 --> 00:56:10,221
Sure.

551
00:56:10,222 --> 00:56:13,250
And a lot of guys are working
on getting to the moon in a rocket.

552
00:56:13,251 --> 00:56:15,353
They think that's
worth working for.

553
00:56:15,354 --> 00:56:17,397
But I like the
ground around here.

554
00:56:17,398 --> 00:56:19,885
And I just as soon
keep my feet on it.

555
00:56:19,886 --> 00:56:22,996
How much money have
you saved doing it?

556
00:56:22,997 --> 00:56:24,999
None yet.

557
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,987
Not even $750?

558
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:30,943
Not even 750 cents.

559
00:56:30,944 --> 00:56:32,579
Why?

560
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:35,302
Nothing, I was just thinking.

561
00:56:45,689 --> 00:56:49,669
Nath, didn't Meg go with you?
I thought she did.

562
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:51,310
She was gone when you left.

563
00:56:51,311 --> 00:56:54,172
- Didn't she leave with you this noon?
- No, only as far as the porch.

564
00:56:54,173 --> 00:56:56,159
Did she say she was going anywhere?

565
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,785
She must have gone
into the woods alone.

566
00:57:03,886 --> 00:57:05,586
Meg!

567
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:10,490
Meg!

568
00:57:11,191 --> 00:57:12,791
Nath!

569
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,148
I knew you'd come.

570
00:57:28,149 --> 00:57:29,974
Are you hurt?

571
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,767
Yes, I think maybe
my leg's broken.

572
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,289
Here, hold this.

573
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:41,404
Now, put all your
weight on the other leg.

574
00:57:56,652 --> 00:58:00,259
We were happy here
till that boy came.

575
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,760
Meg loved me,
trusted me,

576
00:58:02,761 --> 00:58:05,061
did everything I asked.

577
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,341
Then he came.

578
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,810
I'm losing her.

579
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:20,631
I've fought fate 15
years ago, and I lost.

580
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,706
You know that, Ellen.

581
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:34,290
- I tried to stay away from that house.
- Yes, Pete, you tried.

582
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:36,808
She kept calling.

583
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,288
I had to go to her.

584
00:58:40,323 --> 00:58:42,325
Don't dig it up again, dear.

585
00:58:42,326 --> 00:58:45,093
Let's bury it, it's past.

586
00:58:45,094 --> 00:58:47,039
Buried until that
boy came here.

587
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:51,568
Nath doesn't know anything about it,
Pete, that's all in your mind.

588
00:58:51,793 --> 00:58:55,757
Do you think there's a man on earth
who hasn't something to conceal?

589
00:58:55,758 --> 00:58:58,399
Every living soul has
his Ox Head Woods.

590
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,144
I can still see her.

591
00:59:01,191 --> 00:59:03,639
She knew there was nothing
I could do about it.

592
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,610
- He knew it.
- Don't dig it up again, dear, please. Forget...

593
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:10,029
- Why didn't Nath go before it happened?
- Please.

594
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:12,605
Why did she scream?

595
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,344
I loved her, she knew it.

596
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:19,921
- Why did she cry out?
- Shh.

597
00:59:20,054 --> 00:59:21,902
It's been 15 years, dear.

598
00:59:21,903 --> 00:59:23,593
Put it out of your mind.

599
00:59:23,594 --> 00:59:26,256
Don't let it drive
you mad again.

600
00:59:26,257 --> 00:59:28,799
It's gone. It's over.

601
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,306
It can't touch Meg.

602
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:35,012
- There's nothing I can do about it.
- There is something we can do about it.

603
00:59:35,013 --> 00:59:36,994
We can protect
her from the past.

604
00:59:36,995 --> 00:59:40,379
How can I protect her from the past
when I can't shut it out myself?

605
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:44,989
- We can shut it out of this house!
- No, no, this isn't my house.

606
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:48,246
There's no certain
place for me on earth

607
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:51,311
except out there
in that icehouse.

608
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:53,180
That's where I belong.

609
00:59:55,667 --> 00:59:59,629
- What if Meg should find out?
- Pete, Pete, how could she find out?

610
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:01,420
I didn't want her to go.

611
01:00:01,421 --> 01:00:05,108
<i>I'd rather she was dead than ever hear
the screams. I'd rather she was dead.</i>

612
01:00:05,109 --> 01:00:08,433
I'd rather I died out
there in the muck and dirt.

613
01:00:08,434 --> 01:00:10,443
That's where I belong.

614
01:00:10,444 --> 01:00:13,375
- I should have burned that place down.
- No, no.

615
01:00:13,376 --> 01:00:15,544
They'd search the ashes
and find her screaming.

616
01:00:15,545 --> 01:00:18,188
I should've burned it down and
the icehouse and the woods with it.

617
01:00:18,189 --> 01:00:21,239
Don't you dare.
Don't never dare.

618
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,985
<i>Ellen, Pete!
Open the door!</i>

619
01:00:24,286 --> 01:00:25,786
<i>Ellen!</i>

620
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:32,867
What's happened to her?

621
01:00:32,918 --> 01:00:35,579
I found her in your woods.
Her leg's broken.

622
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:38,308
- Call Dr. Byrne.
- Call Jonathan, Pete.

623
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,900
Dr. Byrne.

624
01:01:02,404 --> 01:01:06,329
Dr. Byrne? This is Pete Morgan,
we need you.

625
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:08,439
Meg's leg is broken.

626
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,282
Come quick.

627
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:36,640
It's Nath.

628
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:41,761
<i>Somebody'll hear you.</i>

629
01:01:47,401 --> 01:01:49,802
Oh, I'm so glad you came.

630
01:01:49,803 --> 01:01:53,612
- Why did you wait so long?
- Ellen wouldn't let me come.

631
01:01:53,613 --> 01:01:56,837
I never thought of climbing
that tree until tonight.

632
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:59,664
I wanted to tell you
about the red house.

633
01:01:59,665 --> 01:02:01,952
I followed some wagon
tracks through the woods.

634
01:02:01,953 --> 01:02:03,889
- They were all grown...
- Where did they start?

635
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:05,579
I don't know.

636
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:10,382
I headed up hill just past the big
limestone rocks we saw that Sunday.

637
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:13,580
How's Tibby?

638
01:02:14,252 --> 01:02:15,639
Search me.

639
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:20,210
She's gone to town for something,
graduation dress, I think.

640
01:02:20,211 --> 01:02:22,098
Bet you miss her.

641
01:02:26,972 --> 01:02:28,879
Tell me about the red house.

642
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,567
After the limestone rocks, what?

643
01:02:31,651 --> 01:02:34,079
Well, I followed these
tracks through the rocks.

644
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,003
The road's hard to follow,
but it led to this hill.

645
01:02:36,004 --> 01:02:37,265
What hill?

646
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:41,043
I don't know, I was too busy
following the tracks to see.

647
01:02:41,262 --> 01:02:44,784
I looked down from the
top into the rocks.

648
01:02:44,785 --> 01:02:46,093
And there it was.

649
01:02:46,094 --> 01:02:48,359
What does it look like?

650
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,689
Ugly and awful.

651
01:02:50,726 --> 01:02:52,694
But Nath, I had the feeling
I've been there before.

652
01:02:52,695 --> 01:02:55,299
Lots of people get that feeling,
Meg, even if they haven't.

653
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:57,587
No, this was different.

654
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:03,521
I even seem to remember
the icehouse back against the rocks.

655
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:07,520
Water shimmered out
from under it...

656
01:03:07,582 --> 01:03:08,982
as if it were flooded.

657
01:03:08,983 --> 01:03:12,183
- How do you know it was an icehouse?
- That's what scares me, I know it was.

658
01:03:12,184 --> 01:03:15,464
- But how did I know?
- Well, didn't you go look?

659
01:03:15,465 --> 01:03:18,236
I didn't dare go without you.

660
01:03:18,237 --> 01:03:20,439
My heart started pounding.

661
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,805
Are you sure you
didn't hear screams?

662
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:26,720
Yes.

663
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,971
I think I did.

664
01:03:31,972 --> 01:03:34,480
I think that's why I ran,
I don't know.

665
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:52,564
You'd better go.

666
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:56,007
But come back again
tomorrow night.

667
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,700
Your hair tickles.

668
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,360
Jeannie...

669
01:04:38,361 --> 01:04:39,761
are you all right?

670
01:04:39,860 --> 01:04:42,642
Just turned out my light.

671
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:45,171
I thought I heard
you calling for me.

672
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:51,165
No. I was just
about to go to sleep.

673
01:05:01,220 --> 01:05:02,920
Good.

674
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:08,662
Sleep soundly, Jeannie.

675
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,201
You were in Meg's
room just now.

676
01:05:28,293 --> 01:05:29,719
Yes, I was.

677
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,963
You sneaked up the tree.

678
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:35,179
- You were there with her in the dark.
- Is there a law against me seeing her?

679
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:37,009
Yes, mine.

680
01:05:37,053 --> 01:05:40,415
There was peace in this house until you came.
You took her into the woods.

681
01:05:40,416 --> 01:05:43,522
- Meg went into the woods on her own.
- She wouldn't have gone if it weren't for you.

682
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:45,230
Her leg wouldn't have been
broken if it weren't for you.

683
01:05:45,231 --> 01:05:47,799
You've got no right to
treat her like a child.

684
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:50,367
You caused all the
trouble you're going to.

685
01:05:50,368 --> 01:05:52,430
I don't want you here anymore.

686
01:05:52,431 --> 01:05:53,980
Get out, now!

687
01:05:53,996 --> 01:05:55,919
You don't need to
think I want this job.

688
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:59,163
- I could work for Rentons any day I like.
- Clear out.

689
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:01,782
Never trespass on
my property again.

690
01:06:01,783 --> 01:06:03,826
If you do, you'll get hurt.

691
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:07,346
- Is that fair warning?
- Yes, that's clear enough.

692
01:06:24,342 --> 01:06:26,832
You can take one place off.

693
01:06:27,333 --> 01:06:29,644
Nath's quit, he's gone
to work for Tibby's folks.

694
01:06:29,645 --> 01:06:31,666
Without even saying goodbye?

695
01:06:31,667 --> 01:06:33,856
But it seems they
needed him this morning.

696
01:06:33,857 --> 01:06:36,259
He said to say goodbye
to you and Meg.

697
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:38,171
That's not like Nath.

698
01:06:38,190 --> 01:06:40,699
He's a nice boy.

699
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,541
What are we going
to do for help?

700
01:06:43,631 --> 01:06:45,879
We can manage alone.

701
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:49,266
Meg will soon be up and around
and we can manage alone.

702
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:52,167
Just you and me and...

703
01:06:52,768 --> 01:06:54,668
Meg.

704
01:06:57,540 --> 01:06:59,947
Did you quarrel with Nath?

705
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:02,526
Don't lie to me, Pete.

706
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:05,010
Why should I
quarrel with the boy?

707
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:09,739
For the same reason you
killed Jeannie's husband.

708
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,720
Because you wanted
her all to yourself.

709
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,090
Ellen!

710
01:07:20,180 --> 01:07:21,980
Ellen!

711
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:34,860
Meg, dear.

712
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,103
Nath's gone.

713
01:07:39,140 --> 01:07:41,342
He sent you his love.

714
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:46,211
He needed a full time job
now that school's about over.

715
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:56,363
I was putting some dishes away and
the wall cupboard came down on my arm.

716
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:59,127
We'll miss Nath, won't we?

717
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:24,142
It's going to be lonesome
for you, isn't it?

718
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:27,411
Why don't you padlock this door
and go out to the Morgans'.

719
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,204
I've quit there, Mom.

720
01:08:29,393 --> 01:08:31,799
I'm going to work
for the Rentons.

721
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:35,046
Well, with Tibby around,
then you won't be lonesome.

722
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,780
I'll be OK, Mom.

723
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:45,831
Well, happy honeymoon.

724
01:08:47,160 --> 01:08:49,750
Thanks again for everything.

725
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:53,687
- Goodbye, son.
- Bye.

726
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:03,287
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, Mom.

727
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,130
Hello, doctor.

728
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:29,644
How's my patient? I bet it
feels better with that cast off.

729
01:09:29,877 --> 01:09:33,459
I've been cheating a little, Dr. Byrne.
I tried walking without my crutches.

730
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:36,268
Uh-huh.
I brought up the mail.

731
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:41,931
- Where's Ellen?
- Gathering the eggs.

732
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:44,764
How's everyone in the valley?

733
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:47,604
Oh, new baby at Sheriff Hawk's.

734
01:09:47,905 --> 01:09:50,028
New hired hand at the Rentons'.

735
01:09:50,113 --> 01:09:51,339
Who?

736
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:53,410
Mrs. Storm's boy, Nath.

737
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:55,239
Yeah.

738
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:57,884
Everybody's wondering what the
Rentons want most,

739
01:09:57,885 --> 01:10:02,476
the Storm boy for a son-in-law or an
extra hand on the farm for free.

740
01:10:02,553 --> 01:10:05,435
- Is Nath living at the Rentons'?
- No.

741
01:10:05,436 --> 01:10:07,762
I see him going back
to the store nights.

742
01:10:07,763 --> 01:10:12,527
Say, wasn't he working here at the time
you broke this pretty leg?

743
01:10:12,528 --> 01:10:15,208
Yes, but he had to
get a full-time job.

744
01:10:15,209 --> 01:10:18,219
He's got a full-time
job handling Tibby.

745
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:20,621
She's a wild one.

746
01:10:20,665 --> 01:10:25,367
Well, I've got a few babies coming,
few old folks dying. I've got to be going.

747
01:10:25,368 --> 01:10:28,330
- Hiya, Pete.
- Hello, doctor.

748
01:10:28,331 --> 01:10:31,879
Our Meg's about as good as new.
Young bones knit fast.

749
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:34,750
Yeah, well, thank heavens
she was luckier than I was.

750
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:39,007
Yes, but then a girl needs a pretty leg
more than a man does.

751
01:10:39,260 --> 01:10:42,146
With a little help and being careful,
she can forget the crutches.

752
01:10:42,156 --> 01:10:44,739
Well, I'll help her,
I'll take care of her.

753
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:47,384
I'll watch her like
a Saint Bernard.

754
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:53,240
All right.

755
01:10:56,740 --> 01:10:58,162
Say hello to her for me.

756
01:10:58,181 --> 01:10:59,959
- I will.
- Bye bye.

757
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:01,660
- Bye.
- Bye.

758
01:11:08,751 --> 01:11:11,739
Remember when I had to learn to
walk again,

759
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:15,061
just like climbing
a mountain all day long.

760
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:18,242
Better lean on me.

761
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:21,687
Mustn't try too
much the first time.

762
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:25,011
I just want to help you.

763
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:27,348
That's what I'm for.

764
01:11:27,349 --> 01:11:29,549
That's what I like.

765
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,763
Oh, hi.

766
01:11:44,458 --> 01:11:47,739
- What you got on?
- My new play suit. Do you like it?

767
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:49,330
It's all right.

768
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:53,409
You might as well still be working at the
Morgans' for all the fun you are to me.

769
01:11:53,790 --> 01:11:55,936
If you'd spend a little more
time working around this place

770
01:11:55,937 --> 01:11:58,626
instead of preening your
feathers like a pet canary,

771
01:11:58,696 --> 01:12:01,166
maybe you'd know what it
is to be tired at night.

772
01:12:01,167 --> 01:12:05,154
I had a nice Sunday picnic all planned
for us tomorrow down by the stream.

773
01:12:05,155 --> 01:12:07,319
But I'm not gonna
waste it on you.

774
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,124
You sleep all day
if you want to.

775
01:12:09,220 --> 01:12:11,482
Oh, just till 10:00 or 11:00.

776
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:16,384
You didn't sleep till any 10:00 or 11:00 up at
the Morgans' because you wanted to see her.

777
01:12:16,911 --> 01:12:19,639
Go stick your head under a
faucet and cool off, Tibby.

778
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:22,290
If you want to go on that picnic
tomorrow, I'll be here till 11:00.

779
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:08,528
So you finally made
up your mind to come.

780
01:13:14,532 --> 01:13:15,936
Here's your bond.

781
01:13:15,937 --> 01:13:17,748
I've been here every Sunday.

782
01:13:17,749 --> 01:13:19,733
Well, I couldn't get
here before today.

783
01:13:19,734 --> 01:13:21,857
Who do you think you
are, standing me up?

784
01:13:21,858 --> 01:13:23,519
You've been drinking.

785
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:24,428
So what?

786
01:13:24,429 --> 01:13:28,079
Well, I'm sorry I came at all.
I'm sorry I got your old bond.

787
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,486
- Did you tell anybody?
- You're drunk.

788
01:13:36,677 --> 01:13:38,308
Who are you kidding?

789
01:13:38,309 --> 01:13:41,559
You can fool around with pretty boy
Nath Storm as much as you like.

790
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:44,122
But when you decide on
a man, you come to me.

791
01:13:54,074 --> 01:13:55,919
You had to catch him
when he was drunk.

792
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:59,702
Just try it sometime when he's sober,
just once, he'd kill you.

793
01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:26,326
Can't you see
you're not wanted?

794
01:14:26,420 --> 01:14:28,090
Yeah, I can.

795
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:31,462
The next time you feel like
snooping around Ox Head Woods,

796
01:14:31,463 --> 01:14:34,945
read the signs, the part
about "at your own risk."

797
01:14:35,033 --> 01:14:36,459
Why?

798
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:39,331
Because some yellow belly'll
sock me in the dark?

799
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,723
Because I got full
rights to them woods.

800
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:49,729
- Who gave 'em to you?
- Pete Morgan.

801
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:54,260
Then would you be knowing
how Meg broke her leg?

802
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,683
No, I wouldn't.

803
01:14:57,780 --> 01:15:00,967
But if it was you snooping around
these woods, you'd get this.

804
01:15:04,780 --> 01:15:07,241
Come on, Tibby,
let's get out of here.

805
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:51,023
This is the way it
could always be, Jeannie.

806
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,645
We don't need anybody else.

807
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:10,600
Meg.

808
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:21,888
What's the matter, child?

809
01:16:21,929 --> 01:16:25,519
I don't know.
Just heartsick, I guess.

810
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,609
You miss Nath, don't you?

811
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:29,331
Yes.

812
01:16:29,571 --> 01:16:33,319
And something's wrong here.
I don't know what it is.

813
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:35,990
Wrong in what way?

814
01:16:36,494 --> 01:16:40,060
Ellen, who is Jeannie?

815
01:16:40,061 --> 01:16:42,051
Where did you hear that name?

816
01:16:42,052 --> 01:16:45,675
Pete's called me that several times,
and when he does, I'm afraid.

817
01:16:45,676 --> 01:16:47,619
When has he called
you that name?

818
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:51,163
Up in my room when my leg
was hurting, out by the pond.

819
01:16:51,260 --> 01:16:53,424
Has Pete ever
laid hands on you?

820
01:16:53,554 --> 01:16:55,019
No.

821
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:56,462
Why do you ask that?

822
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:02,905
Finish the dishes, dear.

823
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:16,044
- Anything wrong?
- No.

824
01:17:19,370 --> 01:17:21,359
You're working too hard, Pete.

825
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:23,951
Why don't we get
Nath back to help?

826
01:17:25,528 --> 01:17:27,159
We're better off without him.

827
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:29,222
I'm sure Meg misses him.

828
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:34,305
She's young, she deserves the company
of a nice boy like Nath, a little fun.

829
01:17:35,712 --> 01:17:39,134
That's what you said
about Herb Snell years ago.

830
01:17:39,135 --> 01:17:42,225
Herb Snell was fun, remember?

831
01:17:42,226 --> 01:17:44,633
I didn't have time to
learn how to dance.

832
01:17:44,634 --> 01:17:50,034
I was too busy earning the money that would make
it possible for me to ask Jeannie to be my wife.

833
01:17:50,035 --> 01:17:53,359
And Herb Snell was busy becoming
the best dancer in the valley.

834
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,683
Nath's like you were, not Herb.

835
01:17:55,785 --> 01:17:59,107
He's a fine boy,
honest, a hard worker.

836
01:17:59,108 --> 01:18:01,469
He has a girl.
What does he want with Meg?

837
01:18:01,470 --> 01:18:03,911
Meg needs to be with
young people like Nath.

838
01:18:03,912 --> 01:18:06,599
You can't condemn
her to loneliness.

839
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:07,961
Meg belongs here with us.

840
01:18:08,050 --> 01:18:09,998
Do you want to chain her
to this place all her life?

841
01:18:09,999 --> 01:18:12,206
All my life, yes.

842
01:18:12,407 --> 01:18:14,069
I've given my life to you, Pete,

843
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:17,232
because you're my brother and
I loved you, and you needed me.

844
01:18:17,233 --> 01:18:20,143
You know what it's meant
to me, what I've lost.

845
01:18:20,144 --> 01:18:23,129
You know what Jonathan
Byrne and I might have had.

846
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:24,716
Well, did I ask you
not to marry him?

847
01:18:24,717 --> 01:18:26,779
No, but you wouldn't let me
take Meg with me if I did.

848
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:28,491
Did you expect me to?

849
01:18:28,500 --> 01:18:30,768
Whatever happiness I get,
I've got to find while I live.

850
01:18:30,769 --> 01:18:33,156
You can find
happiness by giving it.

851
01:18:33,157 --> 01:18:35,719
Well, do you think I could
find it with that boy back here?

852
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:39,004
Do you think he'd stop prowling in those
woods until he found the red house?

853
01:18:39,042 --> 01:18:41,526
He wouldn't stop at that,
he'd dig deeper.

854
01:18:41,527 --> 01:18:45,718
He'd dig up a skull and
bring in home as a trophy.

855
01:18:45,719 --> 01:18:47,942
What do you think
that would do to Meg?

856
01:18:47,943 --> 01:18:51,025
What do you think would happen
to her if she found out the truth?

857
01:18:51,026 --> 01:18:54,710
- She'd loathe me all the rest of her life.
- But you've got to be fair to Meg.

858
01:18:54,711 --> 01:18:57,059
All right, so I'm not fair.

859
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:59,281
But I can't let her go.

860
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:01,748
As long as the red house
stands in that quarry,

861
01:19:01,749 --> 01:19:04,790
my whole life is Meg's
and her life is mine.

862
01:19:22,685 --> 01:19:24,150
What are you
going to do, Ellen?

863
01:19:24,151 --> 01:19:26,997
I'm going to burn that
place out of Pete's mind.

864
01:19:26,998 --> 01:19:30,348
I don't care if it starts a forest fire.
It's going up in flames tonight.

865
01:19:30,349 --> 01:19:32,575
- You can't go into those woods.
- I know them well enough.

866
01:19:32,576 --> 01:19:36,316
It isn't that, I didn't tell you or Nath the
whole truth about how my leg was broken.

867
01:19:36,317 --> 01:19:38,819
I fell, but it was because
somebody was shooting at me.

868
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:42,145
- I was afraid Nath would get shot, afraid...
- Teller.

869
01:19:42,146 --> 01:19:45,191
It's Pete's fault for letting Teller
think he owns those woods.

870
01:19:45,192 --> 01:19:47,893
He's just trying to scare
you, but he's afraid of me.

871
01:19:47,894 --> 01:19:49,977
- Let me go with you.
- No, your leg isn't strong enough.

872
01:19:49,978 --> 01:19:51,959
I don't want to
stay here alone.

873
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:54,824
Come with me as far as
Nath's cabin. Lock yourself in.

874
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:57,650
I'll be back before
Pete knows I'm gone.

875
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:59,768
Ellen?

876
01:20:00,069 --> 01:20:01,669
Meg?

877
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:07,410
Ellen! Meg?

878
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,265
Ellen! Meg!

879
01:20:12,860 --> 01:20:14,547
Wait here for me.

880
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,240
Meg!

881
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:08,020
Ellen!

882
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:19,165
All right, Nath, come up out of there.
I got you covered.

883
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:27,809
Miss Ellen.
Miss Ellen!

884
01:21:29,513 --> 01:21:31,259
I didn't aim to kill.

885
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:33,369
Miss Ellen, please.

886
01:21:33,370 --> 01:21:35,170
<i>Ellen!</i>

887
01:22:15,160 --> 01:22:17,447
<i>Pete! Pete!</i>

888
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:21,227
Pete, where are you?

889
01:22:23,028 --> 01:22:24,628
Pete!

890
01:22:26,912 --> 01:22:30,599
Didn't you hear me?
Ellen's hurt, she needs help.

891
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:33,000
Yes, I know.

892
01:22:34,344 --> 01:22:36,944
She's bleeding,
she's been shot.

893
01:22:37,092 --> 01:22:39,359
Ellen's lost now.

894
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,247
Lost.

895
01:22:42,234 --> 01:22:44,057
Nothing will help.

896
01:22:44,058 --> 01:22:46,599
Pete, you're not gonna
sit here and let her die.

897
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:48,731
She was going to the red house.

898
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:54,930
15 years those woods
have been calling to me.

899
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:57,070
<i>Storm's store.</i>

900
01:22:57,260 --> 01:22:58,846
It won't get me.

901
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:01,446
Nath, it's Meg.

902
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:03,000
I need help.

903
01:23:03,001 --> 01:23:05,607
He can't help.
Nobody can help.

904
01:23:05,608 --> 01:23:08,209
Ellen's in the woods, hurt.
<i>Teller shot her.</i>

905
01:23:08,210 --> 01:23:11,074
<i>- I can't carry her out alone.</i>
- Where is she?

906
01:23:11,075 --> 01:23:14,486
On the trail we took just before
we reached the limestone rocks.

907
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:16,279
I'll call Dr. Byrne
and the sheriff.

908
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:18,680
- I'll bring a stretcher.
- Hurry!

909
01:23:20,817 --> 01:23:22,948
You're not going back in there,
you can't do it.

910
01:23:22,949 --> 01:23:25,455
You'll be lost too, believe me,
I know the woods are evil.

911
01:23:25,456 --> 01:23:27,459
I know what's there,
I know the dangers.

912
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:30,925
- Oh, darling, don't.
- Let go of me.

913
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:34,382
You don't know.

914
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:45,822
Darling, I've
stopped the bleeding.

915
01:23:45,823 --> 01:23:48,365
You'll be fine now.

916
01:23:50,140 --> 01:23:52,925
You'll get everything
you need soon.

917
01:23:53,020 --> 01:23:54,626
Nath's coming.

918
01:23:54,720 --> 01:23:57,142
And he's called Jonathan.

919
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:01,127
Jonathan.

920
01:24:01,428 --> 01:24:03,428
Need him.

921
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:07,310
Does it hurt as much now?

922
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:15,662
Doesn't hurt now.

923
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:18,728
Be fine.

924
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:25,224
Pete!

925
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,807
Pity Pete.

926
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:31,644
Pity him.

927
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,682
Love him.

928
01:24:49,780 --> 01:24:52,820
- How is she?
- She's asleep, I bandaged her.

929
01:24:52,920 --> 01:24:54,606
Oh, Nath, thanks.

930
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:57,441
I made a stretcher out of a blanket
and a couple of rake handles.

931
01:24:57,442 --> 01:24:59,852
- It's all I had.
- Did you get Dr. Byrne?

932
01:24:59,853 --> 01:25:03,515
He wasn't in. I left a message.
I called the sheriff.

933
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,190
She's sleeping awfully sound.

934
01:25:13,491 --> 01:25:15,191
She's dead.

935
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,324
What you got on your mind, me?

936
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:19,070
I couldn't get you
out of my mind, baby.

937
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:24,370
That's the way you
are with me too.

938
01:26:24,507 --> 01:26:26,138
Let's do something about it.

939
01:26:26,139 --> 01:26:28,904
Let's borrow your
father's truck and elope.

940
01:26:28,905 --> 01:26:30,567
Elope?

941
01:26:30,568 --> 01:26:32,568
Holy smoke.
Pop would kill us.

942
01:26:32,569 --> 01:26:34,159
Come on, baby.

943
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:37,685
We'll drive across the state line.
I'll cash in my bond.

944
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:42,811
We'll splurge it having a honeymoon
that'll top any honeymoon anybody ever had.

945
01:26:44,051 --> 01:26:48,503
The truck's in the orchard shed, we can
head out the back road, they won't hear us.

946
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:02,584
She hurt bad?

947
01:27:02,585 --> 01:27:04,585
She's dead.

948
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:26,890
You think I didn't love Ellen.

949
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:31,720
Every day for years
she's died for me.

950
01:27:33,100 --> 01:27:35,806
You think I can forget that?

951
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:40,463
But she forgot the woods.

952
01:27:41,200 --> 01:27:43,531
<i>That's what's killed her.</i>

953
01:27:43,960 --> 01:27:46,322
<i>You hate me now, don't you?</i>

954
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:48,928
<i>Yes, I think I do.</i>

955
01:27:50,240 --> 01:27:52,866
You let Ellen die.

956
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:55,700
No, no.

957
01:27:56,580 --> 01:27:59,409
You defy the woods,
and you will hurt.

958
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:01,901
She defied them,

959
01:28:02,502 --> 01:28:04,902
and she's dead.

960
01:28:07,989 --> 01:28:09,759
Ellen didn't hate me.

961
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:12,068
She always understood.

962
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:18,180
You'll leave me now, I
suppose, won't you, Meg?

963
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:20,202
Yes.

964
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:23,541
Everything I love...

965
01:28:24,442 --> 01:28:26,242
dies.

966
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,750
I can't lose you, Jeannie.

967
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:32,823
Don't call me that name, Pete.

968
01:28:32,873 --> 01:28:36,183
Who was she? Who was Jeannie?
Was her real name Genevieve?

969
01:28:36,184 --> 01:28:38,245
- Was she my mother, Pete?
- I don't know.

970
01:28:38,246 --> 01:28:41,427
You do know.
I can't stay here any longer.

971
01:28:41,428 --> 01:28:43,039
Yes.

972
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:45,082
She was your mother.

973
01:28:47,931 --> 01:28:50,776
- Now are you happy?
- What happened to her?

974
01:28:50,777 --> 01:28:51,903
Meg, for the love of heavens...

975
01:28:51,904 --> 01:28:54,005
- She was killed, wasn't she?
- But it was an accident, I...

976
01:28:54,006 --> 01:28:56,599
It wasn't an accident.
Something awful must've happened.

977
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:59,801
- You must have hated her or...
- Hated her?

978
01:29:00,088 --> 01:29:02,370
I've worshiped your mother.

979
01:29:02,371 --> 01:29:04,141
No man ever loved a woman more.

980
01:29:04,211 --> 01:29:07,039
But she married your father,
a man without heart, without soul.

981
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:10,891
- Is that why you killed her?
- No, no, no, you've got to believe me, Meg.

982
01:29:10,908 --> 01:29:12,919
I never hurt your mother.

983
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:15,930
I never even so much as
said a harsh word to her.

984
01:29:15,946 --> 01:29:17,796
And then when you were
born in the red house,

985
01:29:17,797 --> 01:29:20,199
I loved you like
you were my own.

986
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,309
That's why I
remembered the house.

987
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,700
It was his fault.

988
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:27,201
He got jealous.

989
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:30,160
He took to accusing Jeannie
and me of...

990
01:29:30,761 --> 01:29:32,561
bad things.

991
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:34,728
He lied.

992
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:37,309
But the worst was when...

993
01:29:37,310 --> 01:29:39,839
he was going to take
Jeannie and you away.

994
01:29:39,902 --> 01:29:43,311
I ran to the red house, to plead
with your mother not to go.

995
01:29:43,312 --> 01:29:45,499
I heard him coming
home in the surrey.

996
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:49,066
I begged her to decide
before it was too late.

997
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:51,639
She got frightened.

998
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:54,069
I don't know why.

999
01:29:54,070 --> 01:29:56,472
She screamed.

1000
01:29:56,864 --> 01:29:59,390
- There was no reason I wasn't going.
- Then you did kill her.

1001
01:29:59,391 --> 01:30:01,799
No, it was an accident,
I just tried to keep her quiet.

1002
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:04,806
I just put my hand over
her mouth, only that.

1003
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:10,304
She was smothered.

1004
01:30:13,060 --> 01:30:15,360
Then he came in the door,

1005
01:30:15,361 --> 01:30:17,561
and went crazy.

1006
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:20,400
I knew it was his fault.

1007
01:30:20,501 --> 01:30:22,901
He was the one
who killed Jeannie.

1008
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:24,822
I picked up a bullwhip,

1009
01:30:24,823 --> 01:30:26,418
and I beat him!

1010
01:30:26,419 --> 01:30:28,219
Till he wasn't
handsome anymore,

1011
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:30,920
until he was dead, finished!

1012
01:30:32,350 --> 01:30:34,578
I was out of my mind.

1013
01:30:34,579 --> 01:30:37,120
I picked up their bodies and
I put them in the surrey.

1014
01:30:37,121 --> 01:30:39,569
I whipped the horses
into the icehouse.

1015
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:41,857
The spring had broken
through in there.

1016
01:30:41,858 --> 01:30:44,199
The mud was deep, deep enough.

1017
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,031
When I came to my senses, I...

1018
01:30:46,032 --> 01:30:49,173
I tried to kill myself,
I jumped into the quarry.

1019
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:52,201
Ellen should've
let me die there.

1020
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:54,868
Nath! Nath!

1021
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:56,447
Nath, where are you?

1022
01:31:00,489 --> 01:31:01,879
Nath's gone.

1023
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:05,586
He's taken your rifle, he's gone
to the woods. Teller will kill him.

1024
01:31:06,140 --> 01:31:07,327
I love him, Pete.

1025
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:13,266
I love him like you
loved Jeannie, Pete.

1026
01:31:13,560 --> 01:31:16,130
I don't know the woods at night,
Pete, you do.

1027
01:31:16,272 --> 01:31:18,159
You've got to help me stop him.

1028
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:20,982
I'll forget what happened.
I won't hold it against you.

1029
01:31:20,983 --> 01:31:24,947
You can make up for what you did. Jeannie
will forgive you, she'll forgive you, Pete.

1030
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:26,588
I can end this?

1031
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:29,667
I can be free.

1032
01:31:32,196 --> 01:31:33,739
There was a truck
road to the red house.

1033
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:37,109
You go ahead, start the truck.
I'll catch up with you.

1034
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:49,609
Listen.

1035
01:31:50,112 --> 01:31:53,099
- My pop must've found out...
- I wish that's all that was.

1036
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:55,202
What do you mean?

1037
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:58,464
They're after me.

1038
01:32:05,480 --> 01:32:09,442
- Pop'll whip me.
- Stop that crying. Stop it!

1039
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,369
You don't really love me!

1040
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:27,440
Better stop!

1041
01:32:30,188 --> 01:32:32,199
I didn't know what I was doing.

1042
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:35,786
Maybe Teller didn't either, kid,
but it all adds up to murder.

1043
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:37,480
Murder?

1044
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:03,840
Look out, that branch!

1045
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:08,180
We can't make it this way.

1046
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:14,462
Who's there?

1047
01:33:14,500 --> 01:33:18,161
It's Ray Hall, Nath.
I came as quickly as I could.

1048
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,429
I telephoned the
state highway police.

1049
01:33:23,934 --> 01:33:25,759
- Any signs of Teller?
- No, Sheriff.

1050
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:28,825
- But I heard a car here in the woods.
- Yeah, so did I.

1051
01:33:57,740 --> 01:33:59,307
Is Teller here?

1052
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:00,904
Not yet.

1053
01:34:00,905 --> 01:34:02,392
We're on time.

1054
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:24,850
Come, dear.

1055
01:34:24,980 --> 01:34:26,467
Don't be afraid.

1056
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:57,767
Step out of the door,
he'll see us.

1057
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:10,530
Why must we bolt the door?

1058
01:35:43,180 --> 01:35:45,047
Nothing has changed.

1059
01:35:54,200 --> 01:35:56,067
Just as it was.

1060
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,427
Just as it was.

1061
01:36:28,740 --> 01:36:31,140
She's just like you, Jeannie.

1062
01:36:32,141 --> 01:36:34,502
I've come to plead
with you not to go.

1063
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,469
Don't go with him, Jeannie.

1064
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:39,006
I can't live without you.

1065
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:41,249
Pete, we've come
here to help Nath.

1066
01:36:41,340 --> 01:36:43,548
- He could be killed.
- Yes!

1067
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:46,046
I'd kill to keep you here.

1068
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:49,181
Does Herb love you that
much, enough to kill for you?

1069
01:37:03,873 --> 01:37:05,699
When he comes back
to the village,

1070
01:37:05,700 --> 01:37:07,401
we'll be gone, you
and the baby and me.

1071
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,309
We'll be gone.

1072
01:37:09,313 --> 01:37:12,599
And I swear before God I'll kill him
before I'll let him take you away.

1073
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:15,010
You stay here with me, Jeannie.

1074
01:37:15,875 --> 01:37:17,939
There isn't much time left.

1075
01:37:17,940 --> 01:37:19,927
Decide, Jeannie, decide!

1076
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:25,860
Oh, Nath!

1077
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:27,628
Nath!

1078
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:31,620
Meg!

1079
01:37:39,379 --> 01:37:41,169
Stop it!

1080
01:37:42,370 --> 01:37:44,379
Open the door, Meg!

1081
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:46,442
- Jeannie!
- Meg!

1082
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:49,846
- Open up or I'll shoot it.
- Jeannie.

1083
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:04,251
Meg, it's Nath.

1084
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:15,519
Stop or I'll shoot!

1085
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:19,028
Stop, Pete!
Stop or I'll shoot!

1086
01:39:12,878 --> 01:39:15,899
I thought I better finish what Ellen
started out to do, sweetheart.

1087
01:39:15,900 --> 01:39:18,126
I set fire to the red house.

1088
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:25,128
Looking forward's much
better than looking back.
