1
00:05:16,023 --> 00:05:19,611
Come children. On your way to school.

2
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,866
- Good morning mother Goose.
- Good morning.

3
00:05:34,063 --> 00:05:36,854
Here you are, balloons. All colors
of the rainbow.

4
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:12,537
Boys! Boys!

5
00:07:08,757 --> 00:07:12,545
Oh these kids will be the death of me.

6
00:07:12,645 --> 00:07:13,638
Bo Peep.

7
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,034
I'm coming mother.

8
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:18,919
Oh you children will be the death of me.

9
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,313
Ah mother, do you really mean that?

10
00:07:21,812 --> 00:07:23,706
Of course I don't.

11
00:07:24,803 --> 00:07:28,986
Now you run right along and tend to
your sheep.

12
00:07:30,681 --> 00:07:32,173
And don't go losing them again.

13
00:07:32,174 --> 00:07:33,570
I won't.

14
00:07:34,268 --> 00:07:37,853
Come on fleecy, come on curly,
come on wooly.

15
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,323
How do you do my dear Mrs. Peep.

16
00:07:46,324 --> 00:07:48,418
How do you do, Mr. Barnaby?

17
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:50,412
And how is your charming daughter,
Ms. Bo Peep?

18
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:51,908
Very well thank you.

19
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:55,498
Then, may I be permitted to pay
my respects?

20
00:07:56,795 --> 00:08:00,778
Sorry, but she's out tending her sheep.

21
00:08:01,078 --> 00:08:03,470
Thank you.

22
00:08:05,764 --> 00:08:07,953
Thank you.

23
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,117
Good morning my pretty little butterfly.

24
00:08:19,314 --> 00:08:21,104
Good morning Mr. Barnaby!

25
00:08:21,205 --> 00:08:23,698
I bring you a little bouquet..

26
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:26,688
A fragrant token of my deep devotion.

27
00:08:27,488 --> 00:08:30,375
Thank you very much Mr. Barnaby.

28
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,961
And now I have to leave you sir.
My.. my sheep..

29
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:36,154
Nay!

30
00:08:36,155 --> 00:08:38,548
I have long admired you.

31
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:42,436
Deep with wonder on your sweet and
maidenly virtue.

32
00:08:43,035 --> 00:08:46,026
Marveled at your tender loveliness.

33
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:47,023
In short..

34
00:08:47,024 --> 00:08:50,613
I'm asking you to become my wife.

35
00:08:51,212 --> 00:08:52,707
I..

36
00:08:52,708 --> 00:08:54,004
I'm sorry Mr. Barnaby..

37
00:08:54,005 --> 00:08:55,999
and I hope you won't think me ungrateful..

38
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,392
- but..
- I'm a very rich man my dear.

39
00:08:58,592 --> 00:09:00,087
Please!

40
00:09:00,787 --> 00:09:02,278
Think carefully, child.

41
00:09:02,378 --> 00:09:04,870
Lest I revert to other means.

42
00:09:04,971 --> 00:09:07,762
That would be an ugly way to win
a pretty wife.

43
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:10,952
I wouldn't marry you if you were young,
which you can't be..

44
00:09:10,953 --> 00:09:13,148
if you were honest, which you never were..

45
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:16,638
and if you were about to die tomorrow
which is too much to hope for.

46
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,629
We shall meet again my pretty little
buttercup.

47
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:23,019
And then you will sing a different tune.

48
00:09:36,277 --> 00:09:39,264
Fleecy, Curly!

49
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:47,136
I came back to remind you that your
little financial obligation..

50
00:09:47,137 --> 00:09:48,133
You mean the mortgage?

51
00:09:48,134 --> 00:09:49,730
is due today.

52
00:09:49,731 --> 00:09:52,322
Couldn't you give me just a little
more time?

53
00:09:52,323 --> 00:09:55,113
I'm sorry. The law must take it's course.

54
00:09:55,914 --> 00:10:00,395
I shall be back.. shortly.

55
00:10:08,271 --> 00:10:09,861
Come boys.

56
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:11,357
You'll be late for work.

57
00:10:11,358 --> 00:10:12,755
We're coming.

58
00:10:15,347 --> 00:10:16,738
Good morning, mother Peep.

59
00:10:16,739 --> 00:10:18,135
Good morning, Ollie!

60
00:10:19,332 --> 00:10:21,820
Will you come on. It's almost 8 O'clock.

61
00:10:33,085 --> 00:10:35,071
Why, I thought I left you upstairs
in the bedroom.

62
00:10:35,072 --> 00:10:36,268
You did.

63
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,664
Well how'd you get down here?

64
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:39,560
I fell out the window.

65
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:40,654
Good morning mother Peep.

66
00:10:40,655 --> 00:10:41,652
God morgen Stannie.

67
00:10:41,653 --> 00:10:42,649
Good morning Ollie.

68
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:45,042
God morgen Stan.. never mind good
morning.

69
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,140
Come on and let's go!

70
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:48,533
Wait a minute. I forgot something.

71
00:10:48,634 --> 00:10:50,029
I'll be right down.

72
00:10:52,224 --> 00:10:55,110
Will you come on. Do you want us to
be late for work?

73
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:57,404
Don't forget your lunch, Ollie.

74
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:00,590
What's the matter, mother Peep?

75
00:11:01,289 --> 00:11:03,283
I've got bad news for you.

76
00:11:03,284 --> 00:11:04,580
Bad news?!

77
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:08,469
I'm afraid you two boys will have to
find some other place to live.

78
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:10,858
Well what do you mean?

79
00:11:11,357 --> 00:11:15,145
That old stingely Barnaby holds the
mortgage against this shoe.

80
00:11:15,146 --> 00:11:16,741
It's due today..

81
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,037
and I haven't got the money to pay him.

82
00:11:18,038 --> 00:11:21,429
And we'll all be cast out into the
street.

83
00:11:21,928 --> 00:11:25,118
Stannie. Go upstairs and get my
money box.

84
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:26,116
Eh?

85
00:11:26,117 --> 00:11:28,509
Go get my money box.

86
00:11:30,404 --> 00:11:31,696
What are you going to do?

87
00:11:31,697 --> 00:11:33,989
I'm going to give you all of my
savings.

88
00:11:34,488 --> 00:11:36,578
And I'll get the rest of it from our
master the toy maker.

89
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:39,370
No ones going to throw you out of
this shoe.

90
00:11:39,371 --> 00:11:41,963
Oh I can't let you do such a thing.

91
00:11:42,138 --> 00:11:44,132
Tut, tut, tut, tarut!

92
00:11:45,055 --> 00:11:48,540
One good turn deserves another.

93
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,634
Now smile!

94
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:55,116
That's it.. that's it.

95
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:09,369
I owe you 1.48. Stannie Dum

96
00:12:09,968 --> 00:12:11,563
I borrowed it.

97
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,959
I know you borrowed it.

98
00:12:14,257 --> 00:12:16,445
But what did you borrow it for?!

99
00:12:16,446 --> 00:12:18,240
Well you see I had to buy some
more Pee wee´s.

100
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:21,431
I lost three of them playing
with little Jack Horner.

101
00:12:21,432 --> 00:12:24,223
Had to buy some more Pee Wee´s.

102
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,809
Well don't you mind, Mother Peep..

103
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,102
I'll get the full amount from the
toy maker.

104
00:12:30,602 --> 00:12:33,094
Oh you boys musn't go into debt
on my account.

105
00:12:33,095 --> 00:12:36,584
Listen, when the toy maker finds out
that Barnaby's up to his old tricks again..

106
00:12:36,884 --> 00:12:39,774
he'll give me the full amount without
any problem.

107
00:12:40,672 --> 00:12:42,264
Oh, can I depend on that?

108
00:12:42,763 --> 00:12:44,457
Why of course you can.

109
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:48,347
You know the toy maker and I are
just like that.

110
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:50,238
Aren't we, Stannie?

111
00:12:50,338 --> 00:12:51,833
Are you?

112
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:53,031
Why certainly.

113
00:12:53,032 --> 00:12:53,231
Hvem af jer?

114
00:12:53,232 --> 00:12:56,621
- Which is you?
- Why this one right.. never mind!

115
00:12:56,622 --> 00:12:58,815
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

116
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:01,902
Don't forget your lunch.

117
00:13:02,202 --> 00:13:03,598
And don't you worry.

118
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,194
No I won't.

119
00:13:05,693 --> 00:13:07,288
Good bye boys.

120
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,283
Just a moment.

121
00:13:09,284 --> 00:13:13,171
What is this Pee Wee business you've
been spending all my money on?

122
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:14,767
Would you like to see it?

123
00:13:14,768 --> 00:13:17,559
Well certainly I'd like to see it. After
all the money it's cost me..

124
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,553
I think I'm entitled to know what
it's all about.

125
00:13:19,554 --> 00:13:21,150
Alright, look.

126
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:35,202
What do you think of that?

127
00:13:35,203 --> 00:13:36,499
Piffle!

128
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,491
That's the silliest thing I have
ever seen.

129
00:13:40,488 --> 00:13:41,082
Try it.

130
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,579
I don't want to try it!

131
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,876
Why, can't you do it?

132
00:13:43,877 --> 00:13:45,172
Well certainly I can.

133
00:13:45,173 --> 00:13:46,668
What do you mean, can't I do it..

134
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:47,667
Give me that!

135
00:13:47,668 --> 00:13:49,063
Get over there.

136
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,243
It's a certainty that anything you
can do.. I can do!

137
00:13:54,344 --> 00:13:55,739
Uh uh!

138
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:58,427
What for instance?

139
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:43,980
Here!

140
00:15:10,597 --> 00:15:12,287
Just a moment!

141
00:15:24,748 --> 00:15:26,537
Thank you!

142
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:39,395
Come on, we'll be late for work.

143
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,489
Say listen.. when you get that money
from the toy maker..

144
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,484
will you borrow a little extra for me?

145
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:44,482
What for?

146
00:15:44,483 --> 00:15:46,575
Well I lost me Pee Wee and I'll
have to get some more.

147
00:15:46,576 --> 00:15:48,366
Get in here now, will you.

148
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:49,764
Pee Wee!

149
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,108
Good morning, master.

150
00:16:06,109 --> 00:16:07,903
What do you mean, good morning?!

151
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:10,097
You know you're half an hour late!

152
00:16:10,098 --> 00:16:12,491
If this happens again, it will mean
instant dismissal.

153
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:14,585
Get to work!

154
00:16:26,947 --> 00:16:30,232
Say, aren't you gonna ask him about
the money to pay off the mortgage?

155
00:16:30,433 --> 00:16:33,223
I can't ask him now. Don't you see
what a bad humor he's in.

156
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:37,112
Well if we don't get that money, Mother
Peep's gonna be turned out of the shoe and..

157
00:16:37,113 --> 00:16:39,606
she won't have any place to sleep.

158
00:16:39,607 --> 00:16:41,002
We can't let her do that.

159
00:16:41,003 --> 00:16:44,690
Why if I ask him now, he'll jump
right down my throat.

160
00:16:46,885 --> 00:16:48,874
But I thought you and he were just
like that.

161
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,172
We are!

162
00:16:50,173 --> 00:16:51,568
Well why don't you ask him?

163
00:16:52,665 --> 00:16:54,256
Why don't you ask him?

164
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:56,251
Well I can't ask him.

165
00:16:56,252 --> 00:16:57,249
Why?

166
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,240
Well he and I are just like that.

167
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:01,637
Oh, don't be silly.

168
00:17:02,535 --> 00:17:04,529
He likes you better than he does me.

169
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:05,527
Does he?

170
00:17:05,528 --> 00:17:08,220
Yep. He told me he did!

171
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,413
- Did he?
- Yeah!

172
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,102
Oh master.

173
00:17:13,103 --> 00:17:14,399
What?

174
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,393
Ollie wants to speak to you.

175
00:17:17,989 --> 00:17:19,381
Well, what is it?

176
00:17:19,382 --> 00:17:22,172
Well could I speak to you privately
please sir?

177
00:17:22,273 --> 00:17:25,260
I've got a very important question I
want to ask you.

178
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:26,257
Don't bother me now!

179
00:17:26,258 --> 00:17:28,451
Can't you see that I'm busy?! Go
on with your work!

180
00:17:30,447 --> 00:17:34,234
Well if you knew how important it was,
you'd see me privately because if..

181
00:17:34,635 --> 00:17:37,621
Will you shut up and go on with your
work!

182
00:17:49,086 --> 00:17:51,874
Fleecy.. fleecy!

183
00:17:52,596 --> 00:17:54,490
Wooly.. snowball?!

184
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:59,962
No, I haven't seen them!

185
00:22:29,785 --> 00:22:30,479
Oh, Tom Tom.

186
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,072
I don't know what mother would do
if they were really lost.

187
00:22:33,073 --> 00:22:34,368
Oh, don't worry.

188
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:35,665
They'll be found.

189
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:37,759
You've lost them before, haven't you?

190
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:41,847
Matter of fact, last month you lost
them five times!

191
00:22:42,247 --> 00:22:43,542
Oh I couldn't have.

192
00:22:43,543 --> 00:22:44,541
Yes you did.

193
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:46,037
And four times the month before that!

194
00:22:46,038 --> 00:22:48,829
You see, you're getting worse.

195
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:53,316
What you need is someone to help you
look after the darn things.

196
00:22:53,317 --> 00:22:55,610
Who, for instance?

197
00:22:56,807 --> 00:22:59,100
Oh, he'd have to be most unusual.

198
00:22:59,101 --> 00:23:01,294
Energetic..resourceful..

199
00:23:01,694 --> 00:23:03,787
and with any amount of patience.

200
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:08,170
A fellow sort of..well..

201
00:23:08,171 --> 00:23:10,563
Like me!

202
00:23:13,754 --> 00:23:15,345
Not interested?

203
00:23:15,346 --> 00:23:17,738
Not even a little bit?

204
00:23:27,707 --> 00:23:31,288
Then I'll just keep you there until
you are interested!

205
00:23:55,313 --> 00:23:59,893
- Nice? Interested?
- Uh huh.

206
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:37,068
Oh look Tom Tom, they found them!

207
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:42,348
You should hang your head you
naughty sheep.

208
00:24:53,714 --> 00:24:54,802
My dear friends..

209
00:24:54,803 --> 00:24:57,197
and citizens of Toyland.

210
00:24:57,298 --> 00:24:59,092
I want you all to meet..

211
00:24:59,192 --> 00:25:02,083
The future Mrs. Piper!

212
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:19,931
Hello mister toy maker.

213
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,724
Well, how's my order coming along?

214
00:26:22,725 --> 00:26:24,918
Everything is in fine shape.

215
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,514
- Good.
- Are you coming in?

216
00:26:26,515 --> 00:26:28,110
Yes, just a moment.

217
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:32,719
Alright. I won't forget you. Now
run along.

218
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:46,444
Hello everybody. How's everything?

219
00:26:46,445 --> 00:26:48,439
And how are my two boys?

220
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,134
Hello Mr. Santee.

221
00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:54,717
Can't wait until you see the wooden
soldiers we made for you.

222
00:26:54,718 --> 00:26:57,608
The finest piece of work we've ever
turned out.

223
00:26:57,609 --> 00:26:58,606
Splendid!

224
00:26:58,607 --> 00:27:00,202
Ollie! Go and bring one of them in.

225
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:02,296
Yes sir. You'd better help me.
They're heavy.

226
00:27:02,297 --> 00:27:04,490
We'll have them right out, Mr. Santee.

227
00:27:05,888 --> 00:27:08,774
You'll get the surprise of your life!

228
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:18,241
Don't try to lift it. All you have to do
is press the button in the back..

229
00:27:18,441 --> 00:27:20,135
And it walks out by itself.

230
00:27:37,581 --> 00:27:39,869
Isn't it wonderful?

231
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:42,362
It does everything but talk.

232
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:45,848
Wonderful yes. But not what I ordered.

233
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:47,843
What do you mean?

234
00:27:48,443 --> 00:27:51,832
I ordered 600 soldiers at one foot high.

235
00:27:52,331 --> 00:27:53,628
What?

236
00:27:59,908 --> 00:28:01,499
You took that order.

237
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,497
What was it?

238
00:28:02,498 --> 00:28:05,887
I thought you said 100 soldiers at
six foot high.

239
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,071
You got the order all wrong.

240
00:28:10,072 --> 00:28:14,457
I couldn't give those things to
my children to play with.

241
00:28:16,851 --> 00:28:20,833
Put it back in the box and get out
of here. You're through!

242
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:28,108
Here's another mess you've gotten
us into.

243
00:28:30,202 --> 00:28:30,996
Well I couldn't help it.

244
00:28:30,997 --> 00:28:34,287
If you had been watching what you were
doing, you wouldn't have gotten us into..

245
00:28:34,288 --> 00:28:37,278
Come out of there. Not you! It's
for him!

246
00:28:40,768 --> 00:28:44,552
Put that thing back in the box! Get
out of here!

247
00:28:52,726 --> 00:28:55,908
Stop it! Stop it! Do something!

248
00:29:19,534 --> 00:29:21,424
Come out of there!

249
00:29:21,825 --> 00:29:24,113
Why didn't you stop it, you
blithering idiots?!

250
00:29:24,114 --> 00:29:26,107
Now get out and stay out!

251
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:27,105
Yes sir.

252
00:29:29,997 --> 00:29:31,886
Aren't you gonna ask him about the
money for the mortgage?

253
00:29:32,485 --> 00:29:33,483
What's that?!

254
00:29:33,484 --> 00:29:36,972
Just skip it. It's a fine time to
ask for money.

255
00:29:39,964 --> 00:29:42,651
Oh mommy. I'm so happy!

256
00:29:42,851 --> 00:29:44,945
Tom Tom has asked me to become
his bride.

257
00:29:44,946 --> 00:29:47,035
My child.

258
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:48,930
And with your permission, we'd like
to be married.

259
00:29:48,931 --> 00:29:50,925
Why of course darling.

260
00:29:50,926 --> 00:29:53,318
My blessings are with you.

261
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:56,310
And may nothing ever happen to
mar your happiness.

262
00:29:56,312 --> 00:29:57,807
Ah, thank you mother.

263
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,691
Mr. Barnaby!

264
00:30:01,792 --> 00:30:04,284
When you enter my house, I'll trouble
you to knock.

265
00:30:04,285 --> 00:30:05,680
Your house, my good lady?

266
00:30:06,678 --> 00:30:08,373
Did you say your house?

267
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:09,869
Yes, my house!

268
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:12,960
Not until this little debt is fulfilled.

269
00:30:12,961 --> 00:30:14,954
Why mother, what does it mean?

270
00:30:14,955 --> 00:30:16,849
It means my dear..

271
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:19,044
that unless this mortgage is paid..

272
00:30:19,045 --> 00:30:21,935
You will all be thrown out into
the street.

273
00:30:22,235 --> 00:30:23,631
Of course..

274
00:30:25,027 --> 00:30:27,419
We could.. compromise.

275
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,016
Compromise?

276
00:30:29,017 --> 00:30:30,013
Yes.

277
00:30:30,014 --> 00:30:33,005
Should your daughter reconsider my
generous offer..

278
00:30:33,006 --> 00:30:34,302
to become my wife..

279
00:30:34,602 --> 00:30:37,392
we could forget this little matter.

280
00:30:37,991 --> 00:30:40,385
And it could be her wedding present.

281
00:30:40,386 --> 00:30:40,984
Mother?!

282
00:30:40,985 --> 00:30:45,371
Don't worry darling.. nothing like that
will ever happen.

283
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:49,654
Then, let us get down to business.

284
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:05,500
Mr. Barnaby!

285
00:31:05,501 --> 00:31:06,498
You can make out your receipt.

286
00:31:06,499 --> 00:31:09,390
You'll be paid in full, right now!

287
00:31:14,076 --> 00:31:16,264
Well, here you are boys.

288
00:31:16,265 --> 00:31:17,661
Just in time.

289
00:31:20,752 --> 00:31:24,338
This wretched man seems to think that we
haven't got the money to pay off the mortgage.

290
00:31:25,037 --> 00:31:27,225
But we have, haven't we!

291
00:31:27,226 --> 00:31:29,619
Haven't we boys!

292
00:31:31,613 --> 00:31:33,407
Why what's the matter?

293
00:31:34,006 --> 00:31:36,001
Didn't you get the money?

294
00:31:36,002 --> 00:31:38,393
No, you see Ollie made a mistake.

295
00:31:38,693 --> 00:31:39,986
A mistake?

296
00:31:39,987 --> 00:31:42,678
He and the toy maker are not like that.

297
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:44,074
Are you!?

298
00:31:46,767 --> 00:31:48,063
Then I take it madam..

299
00:31:48,064 --> 00:31:51,947
You cannot meet your lawful obligation?

300
00:31:51,948 --> 00:31:54,041
In which case, I shall bid you good day.

301
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:57,930
Foreclosure papers will be served
in due course.

302
00:31:57,931 --> 00:32:01,320
Oh, your not really going to throw us
into the street?

303
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,212
Much as it pains me, I'm sorry.

304
00:32:12,885 --> 00:32:15,474
Big bait catches big rats!

305
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:20,554
Oh mother, what shall I do?

306
00:32:20,755 --> 00:32:23,346
If only he didn't have that mortgage.

307
00:32:23,845 --> 00:32:25,042
Don't you worry, Mother Peep..

308
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:28,930
Stannie and me will find a way to get
the mortgage from that old..buzzard!

309
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:31,224
He sure is an old buzzard.

310
00:32:31,724 --> 00:32:35,411
You know, if he thinks he's gonna throw
this shoe into the street, he's mistaken.

311
00:32:35,413 --> 00:32:36,410
He certainly is.

312
00:32:36,411 --> 00:32:37,906
You know what I'd like to do.

313
00:32:37,907 --> 00:32:38,903
What?

314
00:32:38,904 --> 00:32:41,795
I'd like to put on this shoe and kick
him right in the pants.

315
00:32:44,786 --> 00:32:47,075
Then I'd kick..

316
00:32:52,062 --> 00:32:53,453
What happened?

317
00:32:53,753 --> 00:32:55,148
Barnaby clunked you.

318
00:33:00,931 --> 00:33:02,521
Open that window.

319
00:34:17,883 --> 00:34:19,473
- Ollie?
- What?

320
00:34:20,072 --> 00:34:21,070
We're outside.

321
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:22,067
Good!

322
00:34:22,068 --> 00:34:23,464
Now what do we do?

323
00:34:23,465 --> 00:34:27,053
Take me over to Barnaby's house and
be sure no one sees you.

324
00:34:27,054 --> 00:34:28,450
Okay.

325
00:34:29,946 --> 00:34:32,434
And be careful!

326
00:34:50,876 --> 00:34:52,367
We're here.

327
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:54,561
So far, so good.

328
00:34:54,562 --> 00:34:55,559
It wasn't so far.

329
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,056
We just came across the street.

330
00:34:57,057 --> 00:34:58,751
Ring the bell!

331
00:34:59,152 --> 00:35:01,543
It wasn't so far! Hmph!

332
00:35:14,303 --> 00:35:15,296
Who is it?

333
00:35:15,297 --> 00:35:16,593
It's me.

334
00:35:16,594 --> 00:35:19,086
What do you want at this hour of
the night?

335
00:35:20,084 --> 00:35:22,975
Well you see, Ollie and I are sorry for
what happened this afternoon..

336
00:35:23,275 --> 00:35:27,561
And just to show you we're not mad at
you, we brought you a Christmas present.

337
00:35:27,662 --> 00:35:29,655
It's from me, and from Ollie.

338
00:35:31,151 --> 00:35:32,444
Christmas present..

339
00:35:32,449 --> 00:35:34,143
in the middle of July?

340
00:35:34,144 --> 00:35:36,735
Oh yes, you see we always do our
Christmas shopping early.

341
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:40,322
If you'll open the door I'll bring it
right in for you.

342
00:35:40,622 --> 00:35:42,316
I'll be right down.

343
00:35:49,395 --> 00:35:50,882
He's coming down. He's going to let us in.

344
00:35:50,883 --> 00:35:52,079
That's fine.

345
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,176
Now don't forget..

346
00:35:53,177 --> 00:35:54,474
when he goes to bed..

347
00:35:54,475 --> 00:35:55,870
you give me the signal.

348
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:59,559
And I'll get out of the box, open
the door and let you in.

349
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,451
Then we'll get the mortgage.

350
00:36:04,146 --> 00:36:06,635
So far, so good.

351
00:36:37,736 --> 00:36:40,823
Ah.. what is it?

352
00:36:41,023 --> 00:36:42,418
Oh I couldn't tell you.

353
00:36:42,419 --> 00:36:43,815
Couldn't tell me?

354
00:36:44,016 --> 00:36:45,411
No. You see it's a surprise.

355
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:48,003
And it musn't be opened til Christmas.

356
00:36:48,403 --> 00:36:49,700
See.

357
00:36:49,701 --> 00:36:52,292
Do not open, until Christmas.

358
00:36:54,386 --> 00:36:56,276
Well, that's very nice of you.

359
00:36:56,477 --> 00:36:58,171
It is, isn't it!

360
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:00,958
Well, good night Mr. Barnaby.

361
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,555
Good night Mr. Dum.

362
00:37:06,246 --> 00:37:07,736
You can go to bed now.

363
00:37:08,335 --> 00:37:09,428
Thank you..

364
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:10,425
Mr..

365
00:37:10,426 --> 00:37:11,822
Dum.

366
00:37:12,422 --> 00:37:13,618
Merry Christmas.

367
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:15,612
A merry Christmas to you.

368
00:37:17,806 --> 00:37:18,699
Good night.

369
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,597
Good night!

370
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:20,994
Good night Ollie!

371
00:37:20,995 --> 00:37:22,390
Good night Stannie!

372
00:37:59,473 --> 00:38:03,058
Where as Ollie Dee and Stannie Dum have
been found guilty of burglary..

373
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:08,242
they will be dunked and thereafter
exiled to bogey land forever!

374
00:38:11,931 --> 00:38:14,519
Good night Ollie!

375
00:38:16,812 --> 00:38:20,297
Your majesty.. what are we waiting for?

376
00:38:21,793 --> 00:38:25,079
Oh yeah.. proceed with the dunking!

377
00:38:33,852 --> 00:38:35,245
Come on!

378
00:38:36,741 --> 00:38:39,527
Your first. Come on!

379
00:38:40,725 --> 00:38:43,811
- Ollie!
- What?

380
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:49,091
You better give me your watch. I'll
hold it for you until you come out.

381
00:38:50,686 --> 00:38:54,869
Thanks. Now take good care of it because
I wouldn't have anything happen to that.

382
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:56,864
- I will.
- Good bye.

383
00:38:56,865 --> 00:38:58,261
Good bye.

384
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,657
- Come on!
- All right.

385
00:39:02,649 --> 00:39:05,934
Splendid!

386
00:39:24,177 --> 00:39:26,067
- Is it cold?
- Yes!

387
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:35,833
I'm smothering!

388
00:39:36,532 --> 00:39:39,322
- Keep your nose closed!
- I will!

389
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:04,341
Hurry. He'll die of ammonia!

390
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,122
This is terrible.

391
00:40:15,004 --> 00:40:18,389
Hold your nose, Ollie!

392
00:40:42,913 --> 00:40:45,600
Bring him up.

393
00:40:54,771 --> 00:40:55,963
How do you feel?

394
00:40:56,363 --> 00:40:57,758
You know how I feel!

395
00:41:00,252 --> 00:41:03,038
Here, have a drink of water. That'll
do you good.

396
00:41:05,233 --> 00:41:07,222
Haven't I had enough water?!

397
00:41:07,223 --> 00:41:09,117
I was only trying to help.

398
00:41:10,215 --> 00:41:13,998
Mr. Barnaby. Can't something be done
to stop this?

399
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:15,894
Why yes. Consent to become my wife.

400
00:41:15,895 --> 00:41:18,087
And they will go free.

401
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:23,966
All right, Mr. Barnaby.

402
00:41:23,967 --> 00:41:26,261
I consent.

403
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:31,939
With your majesty's permission. I wish
to withdraw my charges.

404
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,635
Withdrawn they shall be.

405
00:41:35,131 --> 00:41:37,619
Residents of Toyland..

406
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,514
I want you all to meet..

407
00:41:39,515 --> 00:41:42,904
The future Mrs. Silas Barnaby.

408
00:41:46,094 --> 00:41:47,187
You may go.

409
00:41:47,188 --> 00:41:48,185
Thank you sir.

410
00:41:48,186 --> 00:41:50,379
- Does that mean we're free?
- Yes.

411
00:41:51,078 --> 00:41:55,659
And from now on, you and I are going
to be very close friends.

412
00:41:57,055 --> 00:41:59,942
- Does that mean that he won't be dunked!?
- Yes!

413
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:02,630
- Isn't that nice?
- What?

414
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:05,024
He and I are just like that.

415
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:06,421
And I don't have to get wet.

416
00:42:06,422 --> 00:42:08,814
Oh, is that so!

417
00:42:18,684 --> 00:42:20,374
- Ollie!
- What?

418
00:42:20,375 --> 00:42:21,771
Here's your watch.

419
00:42:30,344 --> 00:42:36,520
Run over and tell the bride that all is in
readyness.. and her lover is waiting.

420
00:42:47,088 --> 00:42:48,679
Mumsy, what did Tom Tom say?

421
00:42:49,877 --> 00:42:51,169
He understands.

422
00:42:52,465 --> 00:42:56,453
Now you see. If you hadn't said good
night Ollie, this wouldn't have happened.

423
00:42:58,646 --> 00:43:01,035
Where are you going Mother Peep?

424
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:03,926
I'm going over to Barnaby to make a
final plea.

425
00:43:03,927 --> 00:43:09,111
Surely there must be one spark of
kindness in that phony heart of his.

426
00:43:09,511 --> 00:43:13,394
That's a good idea. But I don't think
it will do any good.

427
00:43:17,781 --> 00:43:21,864
You're right Ollie. You can't turn
blood into a stone.

428
00:43:22,763 --> 00:43:24,154
What do you mean?

429
00:43:24,653 --> 00:43:25,351
What do you mean?

430
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:28,143
Well her talking to Barnaby..

431
00:43:28,144 --> 00:43:32,530
is just a matter of pouring one ear into
another and coming out the other side.

432
00:43:33,728 --> 00:43:35,618
It can't be done.

433
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:40,105
I'm sorry Bo Peep that you had to
choose me for the best man.

434
00:43:40,704 --> 00:43:44,891
Why I'd rather do anything in this world
than to have to give you away.

435
00:43:46,187 --> 00:43:50,171
Why Stannie is so upset, he's not even
going to the wedding.

436
00:43:51,168 --> 00:43:53,058
You are upset, aren't you!

437
00:43:53,158 --> 00:43:56,548
Upset?! I'm house broken.

438
00:43:57,645 --> 00:44:00,432
Not house broken.

439
00:44:00,433 --> 00:44:03,424
He means heart broken.

440
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:07,508
House broken.. huh!

441
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:10,024
Come in.

442
00:44:14,587 --> 00:44:18,666
Mr. Barnaby. Don't force my daughter
into this dreadful marriage.

443
00:44:19,564 --> 00:44:23,551
I'm an old woman. Pleading for her
daughter's happiness.

444
00:44:24,948 --> 00:44:27,337
Oh don't do this dreadful thing.

445
00:44:27,836 --> 00:44:31,025
Mr. Barnaby. I'll do anything you ask!

446
00:44:31,026 --> 00:44:33,019
Work for you. Slave for you.

447
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:36,410
Only don't.. please..don't.

448
00:44:39,601 --> 00:44:41,790
Woman, you're a fool!

449
00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:44,780
The bargains made and you'll abide
by it.

450
00:44:46,078 --> 00:44:49,064
Master, the bride is here!

451
00:45:04,509 --> 00:45:06,904
Welcome to Barnaby Hall.

452
00:45:09,996 --> 00:45:12,483
Shut that door!

453
00:45:15,077 --> 00:45:17,365
Come, come judge. Let's waste no time.

454
00:45:17,366 --> 00:45:18,762
Have you the ring?

455
00:45:20,657 --> 00:45:22,148
Your name is Silas Barnaby?

456
00:45:22,149 --> 00:45:24,143
It is.

457
00:45:24,144 --> 00:45:26,635
And your name is Little Bo Peep?

458
00:45:26,636 --> 00:45:28,032
It is.

459
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:31,618
Do you take this woman for you lawfully
wedded wife?

460
00:45:31,718 --> 00:45:32,815
I do.

461
00:45:34,011 --> 00:45:36,903
And do you take this man for your
lawfully wedded husband?

462
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:39,391
I do.

463
00:45:44,577 --> 00:45:48,959
I now pronounce you man and wife.

464
00:45:51,552 --> 00:45:52,943
And now, to kiss the bride.

465
00:45:52,944 --> 00:45:54,340
Just a moment.

466
00:45:55,437 --> 00:45:57,726
Haven't you forgotten something,
Mr. Barnaby?

467
00:45:58,724 --> 00:46:00,613
Oh yes. The mortgage.

468
00:46:01,712 --> 00:46:04,897
My wedding present.

469
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:19,148
Now, you may kiss the bride.

470
00:46:25,729 --> 00:46:28,017
What is the meaning of this?!

471
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:30,909
Big bait, catches big rats!

472
00:46:33,502 --> 00:46:35,990
The king shall hear of this!

473
00:46:54,531 --> 00:46:56,022
Tom Tom.

474
00:46:58,117 --> 00:47:01,302
Oh my boys!

475
00:47:09,379 --> 00:47:10,870
That sure was a good idea of yours.

476
00:47:10,871 --> 00:47:12,266
It certainly was!

477
00:47:12,666 --> 00:47:13,863
Well.. good bye!

478
00:47:13,864 --> 00:47:15,957
And good luck.

479
00:47:16,655 --> 00:47:18,744
What do you mean, good bye?

480
00:47:18,745 --> 00:47:20,241
Aren't I going with you?

481
00:47:20,242 --> 00:47:21,239
Why no.

482
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,731
You have to stay here with Barnaby.

483
00:47:23,732 --> 00:47:25,129
Your married to him.

484
00:47:32,836 --> 00:47:34,794
I don't want to stay here with him.

485
00:47:34,795 --> 00:47:36,191
Why?

486
00:47:36,491 --> 00:47:38,185
I don't love him!

487
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:52,537
Well don't worry. Old Barnaby will
never bother us again.

488
00:47:53,834 --> 00:47:57,318
- Because I'm going to take you away.
- Where?

489
00:49:29,924 --> 00:49:34,406
Tricked! Cheated! Laughed at
in the streets!

490
00:49:34,407 --> 00:49:36,301
Fools!

491
00:49:36,999 --> 00:49:40,086
So they think they can outwit old
Barnaby, eh.

492
00:49:42,978 --> 00:49:44,569
I'll show them.

493
00:49:46,065 --> 00:49:48,852
There must be a way.

494
00:49:50,647 --> 00:49:53,135
There must be some way!

495
00:49:56,925 --> 00:50:00,410
Idiot! Dolt! Imbecile! Pig!

496
00:50:02,903 --> 00:50:04,593
Pig!

497
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:10,272
Get me a nice red juicy apple. I'll
steal one of the three little pigs.

498
00:50:10,871 --> 00:50:14,256
And the evidence will be placed in
Tom Tom's house.

499
00:50:14,855 --> 00:50:17,647
You know the penalty for pig-napping?

500
00:50:17,946 --> 00:50:20,534
Banishment to Bogeyland!

501
00:51:30,413 --> 00:51:32,003
Sit still!

502
00:51:34,497 --> 00:51:37,283
Take this evidence and place it
in Tom Tom's house.

503
00:51:40,574 --> 00:51:43,062
Master. Why the sausage?

504
00:51:43,063 --> 00:51:49,542
That will prove that he not only stole the pig,
but that he also ground him into sausage.

505
00:51:52,633 --> 00:51:54,922
And now little Elmer..

506
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:57,216
We shall see.

507
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:23,728
Whereas Tom-Tom Piper has been found
guilty of pignapping..

508
00:52:24,332 --> 00:52:28,215
He will be immediately banished
to Bogeyland.

509
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:32,000
Poor Tom Tom.

510
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:35,390
I'm sure glad we didn't have to go
to Bogeyland.

511
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:37,381
So am I.

512
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:39,275
What happens to you in Bogeyland?

513
00:52:39,276 --> 00:52:41,669
Oh it's a terrible place.

514
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:44,461
Once you go there, you never come back.

515
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,950
Why?

516
00:52:46,952 --> 00:52:51,135
Well, when the Bogeyman gets you,
they eat you alive!

517
00:52:52,432 --> 00:52:54,026
What do they look like?

518
00:52:54,824 --> 00:52:58,808
Well I've heard that they're half man,
and half animal.

519
00:53:00,304 --> 00:53:04,387
With great big ears.. and great
big mouths.

520
00:53:05,185 --> 00:53:07,774
And hair all over their body.

521
00:53:08,372 --> 00:53:11,960
And long claws that they catch you with.

522
00:53:16,248 --> 00:53:17,838
Scat! Go on!

523
00:53:18,438 --> 00:53:23,222
Tom my boy.. you knew the penalty
for pinapping. Why did you do it?

524
00:53:23,223 --> 00:53:24,420
But I didn't do it!

525
00:53:24,421 --> 00:53:26,813
I don't even know what you're talking
about.

526
00:53:26,814 --> 00:53:28,907
How can you say that..

527
00:53:29,008 --> 00:53:31,999
in view of this evidence found in
your house.

528
00:53:33,196 --> 00:53:35,486
Take it away.

529
00:53:36,483 --> 00:53:38,775
Your majesty. You made a horrible
mistake.

530
00:53:38,776 --> 00:53:41,269
Tom Tom knows nothing about this.

531
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:44,559
He's been with me all day. Hasn't
he mommy!

532
00:53:44,859 --> 00:53:46,150
That's right your majesty.

533
00:53:46,251 --> 00:53:49,142
Why not let the law take it's course,
your majesty?!

534
00:54:00,108 --> 00:54:02,496
Watch that until I come back!

535
00:54:28,016 --> 00:54:29,308
What does that mean?

536
00:54:29,309 --> 00:54:31,204
Exhibit B.

537
00:54:31,404 --> 00:54:34,792
That means that the pig sausage is part
of the evidence.

538
00:54:36,987 --> 00:54:40,072
Doesn't taste like pig sausage to me!

539
00:54:40,073 --> 00:54:41,968
What does it taste like?

540
00:54:42,567 --> 00:54:44,959
Tastes like pork.

541
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:51,236
Try it.

542
00:54:56,021 --> 00:54:58,312
Why that's neither pig nor pork!

543
00:54:58,313 --> 00:55:00,804
- It's beef!
- Beef?!

544
00:55:02,101 --> 00:55:04,888
I smell a rat!

545
00:55:08,676 --> 00:55:11,165
Barnaby's got a hand in that.

546
00:55:14,954 --> 00:55:18,040
I believe that little Elmer is still alive!

547
00:55:18,041 --> 00:55:19,536
Come on, we'll find out!

548
00:55:19,537 --> 00:55:22,528
You've got to make them hear me
your majesty, you've got to hear.

549
00:55:23,126 --> 00:55:25,814
Tom Tom knows nothing about this.

550
00:55:25,815 --> 00:55:27,809
The little pigs are friends of ours.

551
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:29,803
Why should he want to hurt them?

552
00:55:29,804 --> 00:55:33,094
The violin and hat were in the
house when we got home.

553
00:55:33,892 --> 00:55:36,977
He's innocent I tell you, innocent!

554
00:55:39,072 --> 00:55:43,057
It is with deep regret that I have to
enforce the law of our kingdom.

555
00:55:43,058 --> 00:55:44,453
Take him away!

556
00:55:53,326 --> 00:55:56,312
I tell you I'm innocent! I tell you
I'm innocent!

557
00:55:56,313 --> 00:55:57,708
- I didn't steal the pig!
- Tom Tom.. Tom Tom..

558
00:56:38,779 --> 00:56:44,656
You see child it was folly.. wasting
your affections on a common pignapper.

559
00:56:44,657 --> 00:56:46,646
Let me go! Let me go!

560
00:56:46,647 --> 00:56:48,741
Tom Tom is innocent and you know it!

561
00:56:48,742 --> 00:56:50,436
I hate you! I hate you!

562
00:56:52,132 --> 00:56:54,919
Just a minute! Just a minute!

563
00:56:57,511 --> 00:56:58,903
Silence!

564
00:56:59,602 --> 00:57:01,791
Mr. Majesty. Tom Tom is innocent!

565
00:57:01,792 --> 00:57:05,180
We found little Elmer in Barnaby's cellar!

566
00:57:06,579 --> 00:57:09,066
Let's get him!

567
00:57:21,628 --> 00:57:24,912
I'll give 50,000 Guineaus for the capture
of Barnaby dead or alive!

568
00:57:24,913 --> 00:57:26,707
Dead or alive?!

569
00:57:27,007 --> 00:57:28,599
Dead or alive!

570
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,988
Can't you make up your mind which way
you want him?

571
00:57:32,987 --> 00:57:34,677
Take me to my tower.

572
00:57:41,955 --> 00:57:44,942
Let's go around the back way.
We'll get him!

573
00:57:51,921 --> 00:57:54,105
Alright Mr. Barnaby. There's no
use hiding!

574
00:57:54,106 --> 00:57:56,200
We know where you are!

575
00:57:57,896 --> 00:58:01,381
You better come out, because if you don't
we're gonna stay right here until you do.

576
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,168
Even if it takes all night!

577
00:58:04,967 --> 00:58:07,057
Are we gonna stay here all night?

578
00:58:07,058 --> 00:58:10,645
No! We're gonna make him think we are.

579
00:58:17,326 --> 00:58:20,611
Tom Tom!

580
00:58:28,188 --> 00:58:30,476
- Tom Tom!
- Bo Peep!

581
00:58:30,477 --> 00:58:33,468
Stan and Ollie found little Elmer,
alive!

582
00:58:33,469 --> 00:58:34,467
Where?

583
00:58:34,468 --> 00:58:35,863
In Barnaby´s cellar.

584
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:39,748
I knew he had something to do with this!

585
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:41,144
Oh if I ever get my hands on him.

586
00:58:42,739 --> 00:58:45,427
Come on. We'll find our way out of here.

587
00:58:50,412 --> 00:58:52,501
Oh Tom Tom, we'll never find our
way out of here!

588
00:58:52,502 --> 00:58:55,193
Oh yes we will! Come on!

589
01:01:56,516 --> 01:01:58,806
- Did he come up?
- No!

590
01:01:58,807 --> 01:02:00,401
Are you coming up?

591
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:03,288
You better come up, dead or alive!

592
01:02:03,289 --> 01:02:06,680
How can he come up dead when he's alive?

593
01:02:07,777 --> 01:02:11,561
Let's drop a rock on him, then we'll make
him dead when he's alive.

594
01:02:11,562 --> 01:02:14,452
Now your talking sense.

595
01:02:18,438 --> 01:02:21,329
- Look out!
- Don't tell him to look out!

596
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:23,323
- It might have hit him.
- That's what I wanted to do!

597
01:02:23,324 --> 01:02:24,720
Did it hit you?

598
01:02:26,416 --> 01:02:29,402
- Not a sound.
- It must have got him.

599
01:02:29,403 --> 01:02:30,698
Go down and bring him up.

600
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:33,192
You go down and bring him up.

601
01:02:33,492 --> 01:02:39,672
Do you mean to tell me that you're going to let
50,000 Guineas slip right thru your fingers?

602
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:41,264
Well I'm scared!

603
01:02:41,265 --> 01:02:43,159
There's nothing to be afraid of.

604
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:45,448
You and he are just like that!

605
01:02:45,748 --> 01:02:49,035
Well that was before we were married.

606
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:53,518
All right. I'll compromise. We'll
both go down.

607
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:54,914
That's better.

608
01:02:54,915 --> 01:02:56,311
Go ahead.

609
01:03:06,479 --> 01:03:09,166
Wait a minute.. go ahead!

610
01:04:00,887 --> 01:04:05,571
I'll teach you to trifle with
Barnaby Silas!

611
01:04:51,441 --> 01:04:52,633
- You know what?
- What?

612
01:04:52,634 --> 01:04:53,631
He's not here.

613
01:04:53,632 --> 01:04:55,725
I can see he's not here!

614
01:04:55,826 --> 01:04:57,916
Oh look! Maybe he went through
this way.

615
01:04:57,917 --> 01:05:00,309
I'll bet he did. Let's go see.

616
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:23,233
I wonder where he went?

617
01:05:23,234 --> 01:05:27,221
We'll soon find out. Let's go that way.

618
01:06:03,606 --> 01:06:05,297
There he is!

619
01:06:12,874 --> 01:06:15,561
Mr. Barnaby! You're going back
with us..

620
01:06:16,558 --> 01:06:19,844
Oh.. the Bogeymen!

621
01:06:51,445 --> 01:06:53,036
Come on! In here!

622
01:06:56,426 --> 01:06:59,113
I can't get .. help! help!

623
01:07:12,563 --> 01:07:17,352
They've escaped me. But I'll get them if
I have to destroy all of Toyland!

624
01:07:17,377 --> 01:07:18,772
To the rafts!

625
01:07:46,460 --> 01:07:49,147
Stand back! Here comes the king.

626
01:07:50,844 --> 01:07:52,336
Why all the commotion!?

627
01:07:52,337 --> 01:07:54,031
Have you no reverence for my beauty sleep?!

628
01:07:54,032 --> 01:07:55,028
Sorry your majesty..

629
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:59,017
but we were celebrating the rescue of
Tom Tom and Bo Peep from Bogeyland.

630
01:07:59,018 --> 01:08:01,111
Splendid news!

631
01:08:01,311 --> 01:08:03,106
And who had the courage to do this?

632
01:08:03,107 --> 01:08:04,502
They did sir.

633
01:08:06,297 --> 01:08:07,688
Did you get Barnaby?

634
01:08:07,789 --> 01:08:11,677
No sir! He was running so fast, we
couldn't catch him.

635
01:08:12,774 --> 01:08:14,167
- He was scared to death, wasn't he?

636
01:08:14,168 --> 01:08:15,264
He sure was!

637
01:08:15,364 --> 01:08:16,760
Well tell me all about it.

638
01:08:29,421 --> 01:08:34,800
Stannie and me chased Barnaby and the
Bogeyman so far.. they'll never come back!

639
01:08:42,476 --> 01:08:44,366
What do these Bogeyman look like?

640
01:08:44,965 --> 01:08:47,852
Oh they're terrible looking!

641
01:08:47,853 --> 01:08:50,245
They're half man and half animal!

642
01:08:51,342 --> 01:08:53,931
With great big ears..

643
01:08:55,929 --> 01:08:58,118
great big mouths..

644
01:08:58,119 --> 01:09:00,412
and long claws..

645
01:09:07,490 --> 01:09:09,879
- Come back!
- You don't have to run away!

646
01:09:09,903 --> 01:09:12,295
- Nothing to be afraid of!
- You're not scared now!

647
01:09:14,265 --> 01:09:15,459
They're not half as bad as they look!

648
01:09:15,460 --> 01:09:16,855
There they are!

649
01:09:18,849 --> 01:09:20,341
Follow me!

650
01:09:36,889 --> 01:09:38,579
Break in the door!

651
01:10:29,617 --> 01:10:31,008
- Here!
- What are you going to do?

652
01:10:31,009 --> 01:10:33,402
We'll fix those Bogeymen! Come on!

653
01:10:40,581 --> 01:10:44,365
Come on now!

654
01:12:34,614 --> 01:12:37,701
- Say, you know what!
- What?

655
01:12:37,726 --> 01:12:39,719
- Let's load them in the cannon!
- Fine!

656
01:13:23,755 --> 01:13:25,644
Get some more darts!

657
01:13:32,524 --> 01:13:34,514
- You know what!
- What?

658
01:13:34,515 --> 01:13:35,910
The wooden soldiers!

659
01:16:45,008 --> 01:16:49,091
Let's get the cannon and give them a
parting shot!
