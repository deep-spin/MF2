1
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:50,689
My chest, it's,
like, burning up.

2
00:00:50,764 --> 00:00:52,231
All right.

3
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:56,430
Let's go back, Vince.
Please, back.

4
00:00:56,603 --> 00:00:59,504
What am I gonna do, take back
that knife I left in that guy?

5
00:00:59,639 --> 00:01:03,268
And give back
a pound of 100% pure snow?

6
00:01:03,377 --> 00:01:05,208
You must be
a comic, kiddo.

7
00:01:06,747 --> 00:01:09,807
I don't want
to die, Vince.

8
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,114
Do you know what this will
bring when I break it down?

9
00:01:15,055 --> 00:01:16,420
Vince!

10
00:01:24,064 --> 00:01:25,588
Miserable...

11
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:30,029
Hey!

12
00:01:40,046 --> 00:01:42,241
At least you got
a nice clean ambulance.

13
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:44,614
It's more than
some of us get.

14
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:18,704
<i>We interrupt this program to bring
you a hot-off-the-wire bulletin.</i>

15
00:04:18,772 --> 00:04:21,707
<i>Two criminals have escaped
from the maximum security prison</i>

16
00:04:21,775 --> 00:04:23,709
<i>at San Quentin
a few hours ago.</i>

17
00:04:23,777 --> 00:04:25,711
<i>Vincent Ryker
and William Dabner</i>

18
00:04:25,779 --> 00:04:30,216
<i>stabbed and killed one guard, wounded
another guard and the prison physician.</i>

19
00:04:30,317 --> 00:04:31,909
<i>They reached
the rear of the hospital,</i>

20
00:04:31,985 --> 00:04:34,283
<i>leaped into the parked ambulance
and roared through the gate</i>

21
00:04:34,354 --> 00:04:36,481
<i>before prison officials
could stop them.</i>

22
00:04:36,656 --> 00:04:38,419
<i>Smart thinking, huh? We have
not been able to determine</i>

23
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:40,721
<i>the extent of the guards'
and Dr. Corce's injuries.</i>

24
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:43,388
<i>Warden Merrick has just
issued a statement to the press</i>

25
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:46,626
<i>that both men are desperate and
considered extremely dangerous.</i>

26
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,826
"Extremely dangerous. "

27
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:51,667
<i>Dabner is described as
5'6", 155 pounds,</i>

28
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:53,500
<i>blond hair, blue eyes.</i>

29
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,099
<i>Vince Ryker is 6'1",</i>

30
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:58,807
<i>brown curly hair
and brown eyes.</i>

31
00:04:58,878 --> 00:05:00,505
<i>They are believed
headed south.</i>

32
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,911
All the way to LA, Daddy.

33
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:05,418
<i>Warden Merrick also warns civilians that
these men are probably heavily armed...</i>

34
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:08,113
Heavily armed is right.
A million bucks.

35
00:05:08,188 --> 00:05:10,656
<i>Ryker and Dabner are
not to be approached.</i>

36
00:05:10,724 --> 00:05:13,158
<i>Stay tuned for further
hot-off-the-wire details.</i>

37
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:15,956
<i>And now back to
soft music till dawn.</i>

38
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:20,665
Bunch of lying cops.

39
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:48,190
Boy, thanks, mister.

40
00:05:48,261 --> 00:05:49,626
Things are tough,
huh, kiddo?

41
00:05:49,696 --> 00:05:53,063
It's that jailbreak. They're all
passing me up. They're afraid, I guess.

42
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:56,261
I could be one of them cons
dressed up like a sailor.

43
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:58,664
Well, maybe you are.
How do I know?

44
00:05:59,706 --> 00:06:01,537
Want me to get out?

45
00:06:01,608 --> 00:06:03,769
Nah, I'll take a chance.
Hop in the back.

46
00:06:03,843 --> 00:06:05,538
Sack out for a while.

47
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:13,013
Thanks a lot, Mister, uh...

48
00:06:13,086 --> 00:06:14,644
Justin, Vince.

49
00:06:14,854 --> 00:06:16,845
This is sure swell
of you, Vince.

50
00:07:06,139 --> 00:07:07,606
Another one.

51
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,531
You'll have to
get out of the car.

52
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:46,273
Okay, sleeping beauty.

53
00:07:48,548 --> 00:07:50,914
What time is it?
8.00.

54
00:07:50,984 --> 00:07:52,474
License please.

55
00:07:55,221 --> 00:07:56,654
Just your license.

56
00:07:58,558 --> 00:07:59,889
I.D. Card?

57
00:08:04,197 --> 00:08:06,427
Hey, this is the fourth
one of those things.

58
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:08,558
You're not the only one,
Mr. Justin.

59
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:09,966
Where're you
coming from?

60
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:12,560
Monterey. I left last night,
about midnight.

61
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:15,299
You didn't break any speed
laws, that's for sure.

62
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:18,272
I'll leave the speed stuff
up to the young kids.

63
00:08:18,344 --> 00:08:19,572
What do you do?

64
00:08:19,946 --> 00:08:21,504
Salesman, cosmetics.

65
00:08:22,782 --> 00:08:24,409
Where do you live?

66
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:27,847
It's right there
on the registration.

67
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:30,188
I know.

68
00:08:31,157 --> 00:08:33,625
624 North 8th Street,
San Diego.

69
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,756
Okay.

70
00:09:11,197 --> 00:09:12,664
Okay, get in.

71
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,967
Where'd you get
picked up, sailor?

72
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,407
Gee, I don't know. It was
about two or three hours ago.

73
00:09:24,577 --> 00:09:25,976
What's his name?

74
00:09:26,512 --> 00:09:28,537
I was practically asleep
when he told me.

75
00:09:28,615 --> 00:09:31,015
It's, uh, uh...

76
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:33,185
Justin! Yeah,
that's right, Justin.

77
00:09:33,253 --> 00:09:35,585
I'm sorry, Mr. Justin,
I'm not very good on names.

78
00:09:35,655 --> 00:09:36,849
Forget it.

79
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:38,914
How about it? I've got
a million people to see.

80
00:09:38,992 --> 00:09:40,721
So have we,
Mr. Justin.

81
00:12:09,442 --> 00:12:13,378
<i>We bring you a special news
bulletin from police headquarters.</i>

82
00:12:13,446 --> 00:12:16,540
<i>Police have just identified
one of the two bodies</i>

83
00:12:16,616 --> 00:12:18,516
<i>found in the charred
wreckage of the ambulance</i>

84
00:12:18,584 --> 00:12:21,781
<i>used in the daring
San Quentin escape last night.</i>

85
00:12:22,055 --> 00:12:24,922
<i>The other body is now
listed as a John Doe.</i>

86
00:12:25,491 --> 00:12:28,585
<i>A tri-state alarm has
been issued for Vincent Ryker.</i>

87
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:31,524
<i>It is suspected Ryker killed
a passing motorist</i>

88
00:12:31,597 --> 00:12:34,327
<i>and has used the body in
his effort to confuse police.</i>

89
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,732
<i>We will continue to
interrupt our regular program</i>

90
00:12:36,803 --> 00:12:39,670
<i>to bring you the latest
developments. Some confusion.</i>

91
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:45,872
He's one man,

92
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:48,675
holding the lives of three
million people in his hands.

93
00:12:52,452 --> 00:12:54,283
The people should
know, Mark.

94
00:12:54,454 --> 00:12:55,716
What?

95
00:12:55,788 --> 00:12:59,485
That Ryker is loose with a cylinder
of death that could wipe out a city?

96
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:01,049
That we don't
know where he is?

97
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:02,754
We'd start a
first-class panic.

98
00:13:02,829 --> 00:13:04,558
We could evacuate.

99
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,188
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
Yeah?

100
00:13:06,866 --> 00:13:08,060
Will there be
anything else, sir?

101
00:13:08,134 --> 00:13:10,398
No, you'd better go down to
traffic, see if anything's come in.

102
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,062
Yes, sir.

103
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:17,038
Where could we put
three million people,

104
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,045
with no guarantee that Ryker wouldn't
be right in the middle of them,

105
00:13:20,113 --> 00:13:21,842
no matter where
we send them?

106
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:39,664
June?

107
00:14:09,629 --> 00:14:11,290
Oh, Vince.

108
00:14:12,031 --> 00:14:14,864
Vince, it's been such
a long time. So long.

109
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:16,831
Could have been longer.

110
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,204
I didn't want you
out this way.

111
00:14:19,272 --> 00:14:21,638
When I heard...
Not this way.

112
00:14:21,707 --> 00:14:24,972
What difference does it make? I'm
out. That's what counts, isn't it?

113
00:14:25,077 --> 00:14:26,408
That counts most.

114
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:28,708
Let me take
a look at you.

115
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:34,283
You haven't changed.

116
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,382
You have changed.

117
00:14:40,293 --> 00:14:43,023
The first year you take it
and the second year you change,

118
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:44,695
then you get out.

119
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:46,024
Not this way.

120
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:48,897
What difference does it make?
I'm out the right way.

121
00:14:48,968 --> 00:14:50,959
Could you have
waited eight years?

122
00:14:51,037 --> 00:14:52,299
I'd have waited.

123
00:14:52,672 --> 00:14:54,537
For what, an ex-con?

124
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:57,637
Do you know the difference
between a con and an ex-con?

125
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:59,075
Well, there isn't any.

126
00:14:59,145 --> 00:15:01,773
You're just dead meat,
dishwashing the rest of your life.

127
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:03,007
And what are you now?

128
00:15:03,082 --> 00:15:05,346
I'm plenty,
because I've got plenty.

129
00:15:06,385 --> 00:15:08,979
Enough so you won't ever
have to work and worry again.

130
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,785
I told you, Vince,
I don't want that much.

131
00:15:12,191 --> 00:15:13,715
Darling, I told
you before...

132
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:15,488
But, baby,
you've got it.

133
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:17,825
We can go places,
live big.

134
00:15:19,232 --> 00:15:20,722
Yes, Vince.

135
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,496
What do you think I am, some
kind of animal or something?

136
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:26,094
Don't you think I know what's
good in life and what's bad?

137
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:27,639
I know what's good.

138
00:15:27,707 --> 00:15:30,267
So do you, and you
want it as bad as I do.

139
00:15:32,545 --> 00:15:34,240
Whatever you say, Vince.

140
00:15:34,313 --> 00:15:35,746
I'm not an animal.

141
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:39,216
I'm a person. I want
things, especially you.

142
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:50,222
Excuse me.

143
00:15:50,296 --> 00:15:53,026
I'm Dr. John Wallace. I'm looking
for Lieutenant Mark Richards.

144
00:15:53,099 --> 00:15:54,726
Yes, Doctor, they're
expecting you in here.

145
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,824
Thank you.

146
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:00,862
Dr. Wallace.
Am I glad to see you.

147
00:16:00,973 --> 00:16:03,066
You sounded as if you
might be over the phone.

148
00:16:03,142 --> 00:16:05,269
Chief Jensen,
this is Dr Wallace,

149
00:16:05,344 --> 00:16:06,868
of the Air Pollution
Control District.

150
00:16:06,946 --> 00:16:08,846
Glad to see you, Doctor.
Glad to know you, sir.

151
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:11,041
He's the radiological
coordinator.

152
00:16:11,851 --> 00:16:13,944
I'm going to give it
to you fast, Doctor.

153
00:16:14,353 --> 00:16:18,084
Last night, a convict by the name of
Vince Ryker escaped from San Quentin,

154
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:22,320
after stealing what he believes
to contain a pound of pure heroin.

155
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:24,051
What do you
want with me?

156
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,321
It doesn't
contain heroin.

157
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,493
It contains cobalt-60
in granular form.

158
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:32,494
Cobalt-60?

159
00:16:37,076 --> 00:16:38,873
Just how powerful
is it, Doctor?

160
00:16:39,412 --> 00:16:41,539
Well, it's easily
dissipated and spread.

161
00:16:41,614 --> 00:16:44,606
And in granular form it's the
most deadly thing in existence.

162
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:47,112
Contamination begins
almost immediately.

163
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:49,017
Within 84 hours,
you're dead.

164
00:16:49,488 --> 00:16:50,921
We know that,
Doctor.

165
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,548
Is it in
a lead casing?

166
00:16:53,092 --> 00:16:55,356
No, it's in
a steel cylinder.

167
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:58,327
It's being used under
controlled volunteer experiments

168
00:16:58,397 --> 00:16:59,557
at the prison hospital.

169
00:16:59,632 --> 00:17:01,657
Steel is worthless
against those rays.

170
00:17:02,101 --> 00:17:03,932
What if this Ryker
opens it?

171
00:17:04,403 --> 00:17:06,200
We're just praying
that he doesn't.

172
00:17:06,272 --> 00:17:08,536
If other people are
exposed to the cylinder,

173
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:12,202
they'll become contaminated too,
even if Ryker doesn't open it.

174
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:14,276
That's what we're
worried about.

175
00:17:15,047 --> 00:17:16,605
How big is the cylinder?

176
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:33,259
Vince, where did you
get all the makeup?

177
00:17:33,499 --> 00:17:35,490
I got it from
a friend of mine.

178
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:37,661
We sort of changed
identities for a while.

179
00:17:37,737 --> 00:17:38,965
I'll be right out, baby.

180
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:41,029
Mmm-mmm, you stay
there a minute.

181
00:17:41,107 --> 00:17:42,972
I want to look
beautiful for you.

182
00:17:44,176 --> 00:17:47,441
Two years, Vince. I want
you to think me beautiful.

183
00:17:53,486 --> 00:17:54,612
What are you doing?

184
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,154
Nothing.

185
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:58,287
Come here.

186
00:18:00,226 --> 00:18:01,955
I'm gonna make
this night last.

187
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:09,790
The police are gonna pick
you up, you know that?

188
00:18:09,869 --> 00:18:11,234
I know.

189
00:18:11,303 --> 00:18:13,464
We won't be seeing
each other for a while.

190
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:14,972
Vince, can't we?

191
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,907
We can't. They'll be watching
you. They know about us.

192
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,634
Won't be long, will it?

193
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:23,104
Well, as quick as
I can make it.

194
00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:26,007
Then I come back
and I'll have a bundle,

195
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:29,816
and you and I can go away and
live somewhere as long as we want.

196
00:18:29,955 --> 00:18:33,254
Vince, I love you so.
I've waited...

197
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,163
...so long.

198
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:45,760
He's got to be
in the city by now.

199
00:18:47,006 --> 00:18:49,907
What good are roadblocks if
we don't know what to look for?

200
00:18:50,943 --> 00:18:52,638
There's no protection
against it?

201
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:54,178
Yes, there is.

202
00:18:54,246 --> 00:18:55,611
Line up every man,
woman and child

203
00:18:55,681 --> 00:18:58,206
and issue them a lead
suit and a Geiger counter.

204
00:18:58,284 --> 00:18:59,308
Mark, that man
must be found...

205
00:18:59,385 --> 00:19:01,785
How many men in your
radiological unit?

206
00:19:02,488 --> 00:19:03,887
About 25.

207
00:19:03,956 --> 00:19:05,981
That you can trust
to be silent?

208
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:09,292
They've all been trained in
panic control. They won't talk.

209
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:11,386
The cobalt is probably
in a confined space.

210
00:19:11,464 --> 00:19:13,557
It won't be easy to detect
from any great distance.

211
00:19:13,632 --> 00:19:16,692
Yeah, that Ryker's got
all the luck on his side.

212
00:19:18,671 --> 00:19:21,401
All right, Doctor, brief
your men and send them out.

213
00:19:21,874 --> 00:19:23,808
Washington had better
be notified, sir.

214
00:19:26,712 --> 00:19:28,771
Washington, DC.
It's urgent, please.

215
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:30,780
I'll be in my office.

216
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:47,418
Yes, Hank?

217
00:20:47,493 --> 00:20:49,051
Excuse me, Lieutenant, but
I have three of them waiting,

218
00:20:49,128 --> 00:20:50,220
including the girlfriend.

219
00:20:50,296 --> 00:20:51,729
Only three?

220
00:20:51,797 --> 00:20:54,425
Two of them are in stir back
east and one of them's dead.

221
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,091
The others are transient,
address unknown.

222
00:20:57,202 --> 00:20:59,033
Ryker never had
any friends.

223
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:01,368
Well, let's get to it.

224
00:21:03,842 --> 00:21:04,866
Where's Ryker?

225
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:06,343
I don't know.

226
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:08,572
I didn't know anything
two years ago,

227
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:10,615
and I don't know
anything now.

228
00:21:11,216 --> 00:21:14,379
Miss Marlowe,
we want Ryker, fast.

229
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,082
I think you'd
want to help.

230
00:21:16,155 --> 00:21:18,316
I told you,
I don't know where he is.

231
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,880
But you were
very close.

232
00:21:21,527 --> 00:21:22,994
Very close.

233
00:21:23,495 --> 00:21:27,329
Close enough that he confided in
you, introduced you to his friends.

234
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,463
Vince is the strong,
silent type,

235
00:21:29,535 --> 00:21:32,003
and if he had any friends
he never brought them around.

236
00:21:32,071 --> 00:21:33,629
We liked to be alone.

237
00:21:35,274 --> 00:21:37,765
All right, Miss Marlowe,
you can go.

238
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:40,368
Thank you very much.

239
00:21:42,281 --> 00:21:43,908
Keep yourself available.

240
00:21:44,516 --> 00:21:46,780
Would you like the key
to my apartment?

241
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,347
That won't be necessary.

242
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:52,979
But I suggest that if Ryker contacts
you, you let us know immediately.

243
00:21:53,058 --> 00:21:56,357
I will. Then you can all come
over and we'll have a party.

244
00:21:56,428 --> 00:21:59,625
You have a lot of answers,
miss. I'll tell you a few.

245
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:02,263
You help Ryker,
you become an accessory.

246
00:22:02,334 --> 00:22:04,234
Every crime he commits,
you commit.

247
00:22:04,303 --> 00:22:07,602
Whenever he goes back to the
penitentiary, you go along with him.

248
00:22:07,673 --> 00:22:09,106
You can go.

249
00:22:15,814 --> 00:22:17,975
We put a stakeout
on her, Lieutenant.

250
00:22:18,517 --> 00:22:21,281
I don't want her to know
that. Get Hallon in here.

251
00:22:22,821 --> 00:22:24,311
Good morning,
Lieutenant.

252
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:26,085
Mr. Crown.

253
00:22:26,158 --> 00:22:28,626
Look, Lieutenant,
I know why I'm here.

254
00:22:29,595 --> 00:22:32,325
So Ryker worked for me
a couple of months.

255
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:35,126
Ten.

256
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:37,198
I told you that
at the trial.

257
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:41,271
Am I a marked man just
because I give a guy a job?

258
00:22:41,674 --> 00:22:43,335
A man who was a pusher,

259
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:46,139
and had a criminal record
as long as your arm.

260
00:22:47,012 --> 00:22:48,673
Well, that's
the whole story.

261
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:51,249
I want to co-operate,
believe me, but...

262
00:22:52,551 --> 00:22:55,452
Mr. Crown, if Ryker
contacts you,

263
00:22:56,055 --> 00:22:58,285
you could be signing
your own death warrant.

264
00:22:58,524 --> 00:23:00,116
I've got nothing.

265
00:23:00,225 --> 00:23:01,817
Ryker is dangerous.

266
00:23:02,127 --> 00:23:05,824
If he isn't caught soon, he
might become desperate, deadly.

267
00:23:06,765 --> 00:23:10,565
Sure, I believe you, Lieutenant,
but why should he contact me?

268
00:23:13,972 --> 00:23:17,271
You, uh... You received
a letter from him,

269
00:23:17,576 --> 00:23:20,170
February the 4th,
last year.

270
00:23:22,047 --> 00:23:24,641
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, I remember.

271
00:23:25,084 --> 00:23:26,517
It was something like,

272
00:23:26,685 --> 00:23:29,381
"I'm not getting any letters"
and what a swell guy I am,

273
00:23:29,455 --> 00:23:31,047
you know
the sort of thing.

274
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:32,952
Did you answer it?

275
00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:36,989
Well, to tell you the truth,
Lieutenant, I don't remember.

276
00:23:37,229 --> 00:23:38,821
Are you sure?

277
00:23:39,398 --> 00:23:40,990
Look, Lieutenant,

278
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:44,134
I got a thousand things
to think about in a year.

279
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:47,167
Owning an exclusive
shoe store sounds fine,

280
00:23:47,673 --> 00:23:49,641
but it takes
a lot of work to keep it.

281
00:23:50,242 --> 00:23:53,075
Unless something's important,
I don't remember it.

282
00:23:54,546 --> 00:23:57,242
Did any of his friends
ever contact you?

283
00:23:59,685 --> 00:24:01,585
Just his girl, once.

284
00:24:02,221 --> 00:24:04,348
The reason I remember
her is because

285
00:24:04,423 --> 00:24:07,449
once you've seen her,
you've seen her.

286
00:24:10,028 --> 00:24:12,690
All right. Thanks a lot,
Mr. Crown. You can go.

287
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:14,062
Sure.

288
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:17,096
I'm sorry I couldn't help you any more.

289
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:18,966
I would if I could,
believe me.

290
00:24:19,638 --> 00:24:22,334
If Ryker contacts you, you
let us know immediately.

291
00:24:22,407 --> 00:24:23,897
Believe me.

292
00:24:29,414 --> 00:24:32,383
Now ain't
he the little dandy.

293
00:24:33,285 --> 00:24:34,616
Do you know him?
Huh?

294
00:24:34,686 --> 00:24:35,983
I said,
do you know him?

295
00:24:36,054 --> 00:24:38,113
No, no, I, uh...
I don't know him.

296
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:40,990
Sit down, Hallon.

297
00:24:45,364 --> 00:24:46,626
Spit out the gum,
Hallon.

298
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:49,766
Spit out
the gum, Hallon.

299
00:24:55,374 --> 00:24:56,374
Hallon...

300
00:25:46,758 --> 00:25:49,226
Give me Crestview
2-4-5-9-9, please.

301
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:50,386
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

302
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:05,135
Good evening, Crown's.

303
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,472
<i>Eddie? Vince.</i>

304
00:26:07,045 --> 00:26:08,603
You must have
the wrong number.

305
00:26:08,714 --> 00:26:10,841
Look, don't get cute, Eddie.
I'm in no mood.

306
00:26:10,949 --> 00:26:12,576
<i>Do you know
what's going on?</i>

307
00:26:13,185 --> 00:26:15,517
I know what's going on,
but you don't, not yet.

308
00:26:15,654 --> 00:26:16,780
Listen to me...

309
00:26:16,855 --> 00:26:18,550
<i>Hello, Eddie?
Eddie?</i>

310
00:26:19,591 --> 00:26:20,922
<i>What's up?</i>

311
00:26:21,793 --> 00:26:23,283
All right, honey, sure.

312
00:26:23,562 --> 00:26:24,722
Cops, huh?

313
00:26:24,796 --> 00:26:27,424
<i>No. No, no, I'm not mad.</i>

314
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:29,427
Uh, listen,
hold on a minute.

315
00:26:30,802 --> 00:26:31,802
Jeannie?

316
00:26:31,904 --> 00:26:33,303
Yes, Mr. Crown?

317
00:26:39,344 --> 00:26:41,005
I'll take this
in my office.

318
00:26:44,016 --> 00:26:46,211
Take care of your customer,
sweetheart.

319
00:26:46,318 --> 00:26:47,751
I'll hang up for you.

320
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,615
That's all right.
Thank you.

321
00:27:02,567 --> 00:27:04,034
Is there something
I can do for you?

322
00:27:04,102 --> 00:27:06,935
You sure make it hard to say no, honey.

323
00:27:07,572 --> 00:27:09,597
But Mr. Crown will
take care of me.

324
00:27:20,953 --> 00:27:22,079
Get out of here.

325
00:27:23,221 --> 00:27:24,518
Now, baby,

326
00:27:24,923 --> 00:27:27,721
I'm just smart enough
to know cops are smart.

327
00:27:28,527 --> 00:27:32,520
So if Crown was called in, it's 'cause
the cops figure Vince might contact him.

328
00:27:32,998 --> 00:27:34,260
Why?

329
00:27:34,866 --> 00:27:37,061
Because they know
something I don't.

330
00:27:37,436 --> 00:27:39,734
What? I don't know.

331
00:27:40,772 --> 00:27:42,569
But cops are smart,

332
00:27:43,275 --> 00:27:45,402
so I'll have to
go along with them.

333
00:27:45,744 --> 00:27:48,042
Smart?

334
00:27:51,683 --> 00:27:54,208
I've always been a soft
touch for you, Pete.

335
00:27:54,853 --> 00:27:56,320
That's just ended.

336
00:27:56,688 --> 00:27:59,714
Okay, Mr. Crown.

337
00:28:01,526 --> 00:28:02,925
Ah, Mr. Parker,

338
00:28:03,795 --> 00:28:07,663
I won't have you leaving this
establishment dissatisfied, believe me.

339
00:28:10,002 --> 00:28:12,436
I don't know anything
about Ryker. Why should I?

340
00:28:12,537 --> 00:28:14,300
And you shouldn't
be here.

341
00:28:15,674 --> 00:28:17,801
The cops are probably
watching both of us right now,

342
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:20,969
putting two and two together
like you're trying to do.

343
00:28:21,046 --> 00:28:23,037
Why don't you be smart
and forget it?

344
00:28:26,852 --> 00:28:28,843
How about a pair of
alligator shoes?

345
00:28:29,521 --> 00:28:31,011
With my compliments.

346
00:28:59,017 --> 00:29:01,281
We know he's here
somewhere, but where?

347
00:29:01,353 --> 00:29:02,547
We haven't any leads.

348
00:29:02,621 --> 00:29:05,112
We don't even know
what identity he's using.

349
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:07,658
A stakeout on a girl's
apartment and a couple of bars

350
00:29:07,726 --> 00:29:09,785
in 600 square miles.

351
00:29:10,462 --> 00:29:12,259
I tell you, Mark,
it's ridiculous.

352
00:29:12,697 --> 00:29:14,426
It's
only been 46 hours.

353
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:16,464
Forty-six years, Mark.

354
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:23,641
The people have a right
to know what's facing them.

355
00:29:24,176 --> 00:29:26,736
They won't know who's facing
them any more than we do.

356
00:29:26,812 --> 00:29:28,245
Everyone will be
under suspicion.

357
00:29:28,313 --> 00:29:30,873
The phone lines will be
jammed with false reports.

358
00:29:30,949 --> 00:29:33,281
The people will be driven
to it, they'll be scared,

359
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:34,943
just like we are.

360
00:29:35,587 --> 00:29:38,988
The only difference is,
we get paid not to show it.

361
00:29:39,057 --> 00:29:40,786
Huh. I don't think
we're being fair.

362
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:43,225
They might take it more
calmly then we think.

363
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:45,522
Look at the English
during the Blitz.

364
00:29:45,797 --> 00:29:48,197
They knew where the
bombs were coming from.

365
00:29:49,234 --> 00:29:52,567
Well, we could have the mayor
go on television and radio

366
00:29:52,637 --> 00:29:54,696
and explain it
carefully and calmly.

367
00:29:55,273 --> 00:29:57,537
Ryker might have
that thing open right now.

368
00:29:57,676 --> 00:29:59,303
I don't think so.

369
00:29:59,744 --> 00:30:01,234
Why not?

370
00:30:01,613 --> 00:30:04,411
If it were floating, we
would have detected it by now.

371
00:30:04,483 --> 00:30:06,781
He's gonna need
some kind of tools, too.

372
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:09,246
But as for telling
the people,

373
00:30:10,055 --> 00:30:13,218
it's an alternative we wouldn't
choose, but it's one we've got.

374
00:30:13,358 --> 00:30:15,690
You could tell them it won't
wipe out the whole city.

375
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,752
There's not enough of it.
It's not a bomb. However,

376
00:30:18,897 --> 00:30:22,958
it will contaminate entire
farms, milk, butter, eggs,

377
00:30:24,336 --> 00:30:27,635
get carried into markets
on meat and produce,

378
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,867
into theaters
and restaurants,

379
00:30:30,442 --> 00:30:33,639
get carried around by people on
their clothes, on their shoes,

380
00:30:33,712 --> 00:30:36,738
on insects and birds,
and on children.

381
00:30:38,183 --> 00:30:41,311
Then you'll have to describe
the symptoms to watch out for.

382
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,250
Hoarse coughing, heavy
sweat, horrible retching.

383
00:30:46,892 --> 00:30:50,384
Then the blood begins to
break down, then the cells.

384
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:55,057
If you merely touch your skin, the
watered blood just oozes out of your pores.

385
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:57,158
Finally,
you hemorrhage internally.

386
00:30:57,402 --> 00:30:58,960
Blood fills the lungs.

387
00:31:00,705 --> 00:31:03,697
I doubt if anyone can explain
that calmly to three million people

388
00:31:03,775 --> 00:31:06,369
without touching off
the worst panic in history.

389
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,412
Yes?

390
00:31:14,052 --> 00:31:15,519
Oh, it's for you, Doctor.

391
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,086
Yes?

392
00:31:23,695 --> 00:31:25,526
Oh, fine, Tony.

393
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:30,425
Now begin your cross section about four
or five blocks from your original point.

394
00:31:30,535 --> 00:31:31,832
Yes, fine.

395
00:31:32,904 --> 00:31:34,895
Can we have
another 24 hours?

396
00:31:35,907 --> 00:31:37,101
Yes.

397
00:31:38,276 --> 00:31:40,141
What about Ryker's
condition?

398
00:31:40,645 --> 00:31:42,875
It all depends how quickly
he's become affected.

399
00:31:42,948 --> 00:31:45,143
In some cases, it's only
a matter of a few hours.

400
00:31:45,884 --> 00:31:48,409
He could be coughing
and perspiring right now.

401
00:31:49,654 --> 00:31:52,350
Notify all hospitals and
emergency medical centers

402
00:31:52,424 --> 00:31:56,952
to report all cases of nausea and
upset stomach due to unknown causes.

403
00:31:57,462 --> 00:32:00,829
The same thing applies to all
doctors' answering services.

404
00:32:01,566 --> 00:32:02,999
Yes, sir.

405
00:34:18,803 --> 00:34:19,929
Open it up!

406
00:34:21,072 --> 00:34:22,539
Open it up!
Who is it?

407
00:34:29,814 --> 00:34:32,214
I've been out there for
30 minutes making sure.

408
00:34:32,283 --> 00:34:34,979
I told you today, I'm clean. The cops
still don't know a thing about me.

409
00:34:35,086 --> 00:34:37,418
Oh, yeah? Well, June's
place is staked out,

410
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:39,548
and so are two other joints
I used to hang out in.

411
00:34:39,624 --> 00:34:41,114
What makes you so sure?

412
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,090
What's the matter with you?
Have you gone nuts?

413
00:34:44,662 --> 00:34:46,823
I spent over two years
up in the joint.

414
00:34:46,898 --> 00:34:48,957
I went through a lot
of cops to get here.

415
00:34:49,134 --> 00:34:50,999
They still don't even
know who that stiff is.

416
00:34:51,069 --> 00:34:53,196
So you've been lucky.
Don't push it.

417
00:34:54,372 --> 00:34:57,933
Those clothes you're wearing look like
they were made by a hopped-up tailor.

418
00:34:58,543 --> 00:35:01,876
They're even pulling cops out
of retirement to look for you.

419
00:35:02,046 --> 00:35:03,877
I've been over
this block 20 times,

420
00:35:03,948 --> 00:35:07,042
followed my phone line for seven
blocks, that's what makes me sure.

421
00:35:09,387 --> 00:35:10,854
Hmm. You sound great.

422
00:35:12,023 --> 00:35:14,355
Have some coffee and
a sandwich, roast beef.

423
00:35:14,426 --> 00:35:17,293
I've waited so long to eat,
now I'm not even hungry.

424
00:35:17,395 --> 00:35:19,260
Clothes are
in the suitcase,

425
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,888
with the hammer
and the chisel.

426
00:35:20,965 --> 00:35:24,401
I don't know what's wrong with me.
I've just been sweating and drinking

427
00:35:24,469 --> 00:35:26,630
and sweating and
drinking some more.

428
00:35:26,704 --> 00:35:27,864
You got a drink?

429
00:35:27,939 --> 00:35:29,133
No.

430
00:35:29,207 --> 00:35:30,765
I should've
stopped for one.

431
00:35:30,842 --> 00:35:32,469
And expose yourself more?

432
00:35:32,577 --> 00:35:34,204
That
would've been dumb.

433
00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:36,338
Look, knock off this
"nuts" and "dumb" stuff.

434
00:35:36,414 --> 00:35:38,314
You're not talking
to some punk.

435
00:35:38,383 --> 00:35:40,078
I'm the guy that made
you a lot of dough.

436
00:35:40,151 --> 00:35:41,743
All right, Vince.

437
00:35:43,188 --> 00:35:45,679
If you want to play big shot,
play it with somebody else.

438
00:35:45,757 --> 00:35:47,884
One word from me and
you're out of business.

439
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:50,189
Look, who's hiding you?
Taking care of you?

440
00:35:50,261 --> 00:35:54,027
And when they wanted to find out who
supplied me, who told them to take a walk?

441
00:35:57,802 --> 00:36:00,066
Come on big with other
people, but not with me.

442
00:36:00,138 --> 00:36:02,003
Look, Vince, I got
no argument with you.

443
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:03,335
Great.

444
00:36:06,578 --> 00:36:09,103
Get yourself a pencil and paper
and I'll hand you a half million.

445
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,114
Look, Vince,
this is no time to...

446
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:14,910
Oh, right now that feels
better than anything.

447
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,187
You ready?

448
00:36:21,092 --> 00:36:22,150
All right.

449
00:36:22,227 --> 00:36:23,592
One pound of snow,

450
00:36:23,862 --> 00:36:26,092
440 grains
to the ounce.

451
00:36:26,364 --> 00:36:27,729
We cut it.

452
00:36:29,334 --> 00:36:30,892
Where'd you get
the stuff?

453
00:36:31,035 --> 00:36:33,526
<i>They're conducting some
secret junky tests up at Q.</i>

454
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:35,197
Huh. Does that
hand you a laugh?

455
00:36:36,474 --> 00:36:39,466
There's no secrets
where 3,500 cons live.

456
00:36:41,513 --> 00:36:43,037
Boy, I feel rotten.

457
00:36:44,182 --> 00:36:47,151
I just figured out why the
cops haven't mentioned this.

458
00:36:47,852 --> 00:36:49,945
They could follow
a peddler right to you.

459
00:36:50,321 --> 00:36:52,152
Believe me, that's it.

460
00:36:52,223 --> 00:36:53,383
I knew that yesterday.

461
00:36:53,458 --> 00:36:56,916
Yeah, but if they get into a bind about
not finding you, they will release it.

462
00:36:57,028 --> 00:36:58,256
So what?

463
00:36:58,329 --> 00:37:01,321
You know a junkie who can't
smell a fix 100 miles away?

464
00:37:01,432 --> 00:37:05,664
Look, Vince, in 24 hours I can have
you in Miami, then over to Cuba.

465
00:37:05,803 --> 00:37:10,035
Sun, ocean, casinos, just
taking it easy. Sound good?

466
00:37:10,308 --> 00:37:11,468
Who buys in Cuba?

467
00:37:11,543 --> 00:37:14,307
Look, when the law finally gets
around to realizing that you're gone,

468
00:37:14,379 --> 00:37:16,904
they have to figure that
the stuff is gone too.

469
00:37:16,981 --> 00:37:18,539
But it's here with me.

470
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:21,610
Things quiet down,
get tucked away in the files,

471
00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:23,347
and we've got a million.

472
00:37:23,755 --> 00:37:25,689
Well, I don't buy
the Cuba bit.

473
00:37:25,757 --> 00:37:29,659
Look, this stays, I stay, and
you get rid of it when I say so.

474
00:37:30,929 --> 00:37:32,590
Vince? It's Pete Hallon.

475
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:34,762
Then he did...
What?

476
00:37:34,832 --> 00:37:36,322
He was in the store
when you called.

477
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:38,266
He could have
told the cops.

478
00:37:38,336 --> 00:37:40,964
Well, if he did, I want him in here now.

479
00:37:44,242 --> 00:37:45,242
You alone, Pete?

480
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:47,676
You're kidding.

481
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:49,339
Well, look,
I'll open the door

482
00:37:49,414 --> 00:37:51,814
and you put your arm
in, real easy.

483
00:37:54,452 --> 00:37:56,852
Vince! My arm!

484
00:37:56,921 --> 00:37:57,945
Now, the truth,
are you alone?

485
00:37:58,022 --> 00:38:00,820
Oh, Vince!
Please! I swear! Please!

486
00:38:07,231 --> 00:38:08,926
Things are rough
all over.

487
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,365
How did you
know I was here?

488
00:38:10,435 --> 00:38:13,529
Well I... I've been
waiting for you, Vince boy.

489
00:38:13,605 --> 00:38:16,540
You can use me, Vince. It's big enough.

490
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:19,307
Rabbit Ears Pete.

491
00:38:19,978 --> 00:38:22,640
Well, look, make yourself
at home. Have some coffee.

492
00:38:27,185 --> 00:38:28,675
Twenty-five grand,
no more.

493
00:38:28,786 --> 00:38:30,185
On my word.

494
00:38:30,254 --> 00:38:33,223
Where did you
learn this one, Vince?

495
00:38:34,058 --> 00:38:35,389
I got a few.

496
00:38:36,294 --> 00:38:37,420
You better burn
those clothes.

497
00:38:37,495 --> 00:38:40,430
Vince, it's dangerous for
you to stay around here.

498
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:45,097
I'll work on it
here tomorrow.

514
00:39:37,388 --> 00:39:39,822
Unit 32 to headquarters.

515
00:39:40,124 --> 00:39:42,524
Put me through
to Dr. Wallace.

516
00:39:46,764 --> 00:39:49,460
Wallace.

517
00:39:50,168 --> 00:39:53,331
District five, covered.
No results.

518
00:39:54,405 --> 00:39:58,171
Oh, okay, Timmons, you'd better
start making another round right away.

519
00:39:58,242 --> 00:39:59,334
<i>Over.</i>

520
00:40:00,111 --> 00:40:01,111
Uh...

521
00:40:01,913 --> 00:40:03,380
Where's the chief?

522
00:40:03,848 --> 00:40:05,042
You want me
to wake him up?

523
00:40:05,116 --> 00:40:07,744
No, I haven't got
anything to tell him.

524
00:40:08,252 --> 00:40:09,913
I don't know...

525
00:40:11,055 --> 00:40:13,580
Maybe our directives
are all wrong.

526
00:40:15,026 --> 00:40:17,995
We said, "From unknown
causes only. "

527
00:40:21,399 --> 00:40:24,562
Every report of sickness
has been from overeating,

528
00:40:24,635 --> 00:40:26,569
overdrinking,
or intestinal flu.

529
00:40:30,341 --> 00:40:34,243
Yes, Wallace. No, no, Tony, nothing yet.

530
00:40:36,314 --> 00:40:37,781
Chief, I would have
awakened you, but...

531
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:39,339
I wasn't sleeping.

532
00:40:39,951 --> 00:40:43,648
If Ryker isn't in custody in 24
hours, I'm notifying the mayor.

533
00:40:43,721 --> 00:40:44,745
Bill, you can't...

534
00:40:44,822 --> 00:40:47,586
That's my decision, Mark.
Not a minute longer.

535
00:40:47,658 --> 00:40:51,059
You think I like it? I'm
praying it won't be necessary.

536
00:40:51,763 --> 00:40:54,891
We have to risk a panic
in order to be prepared.

537
00:41:50,188 --> 00:41:51,985
Unit 32 to headquarters.

538
00:41:53,558 --> 00:41:55,526
Unit 32 to headquarters.

539
00:41:55,593 --> 00:41:58,892
The last complete report
coming in over an hour ago.

540
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:02,099
Well, at least he hasn't
opened the cylinder yet.

541
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:03,895
It's almost 60 hours, John.

542
00:42:03,968 --> 00:42:05,697
Won't that make it
easier to detect?

543
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:08,068
Not if it's in a confined
space. If Ryker...

544
00:42:11,576 --> 00:42:13,942
Jensen. Timmons?

545
00:42:14,612 --> 00:42:15,806
That's my man.

546
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,314
The devil with roentgens. Where?

547
00:42:19,183 --> 00:42:20,411
Fine.

548
00:42:20,818 --> 00:42:23,082
Don't let anyone
touch that car.

549
00:42:23,454 --> 00:42:24,716
Doctor.
Wallace.

550
00:42:24,789 --> 00:42:26,916
5100 block,
the Palm Drive.

551
00:42:26,991 --> 00:42:28,219
A car with
a dead man in it.

552
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:30,283
Ryker?
Could be.

553
00:42:31,062 --> 00:42:32,529
He didn't die
of radiation.

554
00:42:33,264 --> 00:42:34,629
He was murdered.

555
00:42:34,699 --> 00:42:36,257
Well, then
someone must...

556
00:42:36,334 --> 00:42:39,826
Got there first and now
has the cobalt. Let's go.

557
00:42:42,373 --> 00:42:44,898
Have a car ready
for Lieutenant Richards.

558
00:42:44,976 --> 00:42:48,412
Have all units in the Palm
Drive area proceed there at once.

559
00:42:48,479 --> 00:42:49,605
Talk to a man named Timmons

560
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,012
<i>until Lieutenant Richards
gets there. Yes, sir.</i>

561
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:54,950
Have an ambulance and tow
truck proceed to the same area.

562
00:43:14,906 --> 00:43:18,069
It's still holding over
200 points there, Doctor.

563
00:43:18,142 --> 00:43:22,238
Say, this guy's been yapping about a hot
car with Ryker dead inside, Lieutenant.

564
00:43:22,313 --> 00:43:23,405
That's right, Sergeant.

565
00:43:23,481 --> 00:43:26,279
But that ain't Ryker
in there, Lieutenant.

566
00:43:26,817 --> 00:43:29,149
It's gotten into
the metal, John.

567
00:43:31,989 --> 00:43:34,719
Pete Hallon! Had a
chance to go through it?

568
00:43:34,792 --> 00:43:36,487
It's not in there, Lieutenant.
It would have registered.

569
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,289
Say, what's this all
about, Lieutenant?

570
00:43:38,362 --> 00:43:40,387
Never mind, Sergeant.
Let these boys handle it.

571
00:43:40,464 --> 00:43:42,329
Just keep these
people moving.

572
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,336
That car's been completely stripped,
too. Registration, license plates.

573
00:43:46,404 --> 00:43:48,668
There's not even an old matchbook
cover in there, Lieutenant.

574
00:43:48,739 --> 00:43:51,970
Not all, Timmons. Raise that
hood, get the motor number.

575
00:43:53,044 --> 00:43:55,478
This may be Ryker's
big mistake, John.

576
00:43:55,546 --> 00:43:58,811
Let's just hope we have
time to take advantage of it.

577
00:44:06,424 --> 00:44:08,289
Unit one to unit two.

578
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:09,917
<i>Go ahead, Mark.</i>

579
00:44:09,994 --> 00:44:12,827
Pete Hallon found dead
in an unidentified car.

580
00:44:12,897 --> 00:44:15,297
<i>Hallon? What about
the other thing?</i>

581
00:44:15,366 --> 00:44:17,766
It's gone. Suspect this
is the missing car.

582
00:44:17,835 --> 00:44:20,895
Getting the... Oh,
here's the engine number.

583
00:44:21,672 --> 00:44:27,872
L- H-V-1-3-0-2-6-5-4-5-7-A.
Repeat.

584
00:44:28,546 --> 00:44:32,448
<i>L- H-V-1-3-0-2-6-5-4-5-7-A.</i>

585
00:44:33,117 --> 00:44:35,677
<i>Good, Mark,
I'll get to it myself.</i>

586
00:44:35,753 --> 00:44:37,152
Out.

587
00:44:38,756 --> 00:44:40,724
At least that
still leaves Ryker.

588
00:44:46,397 --> 00:44:48,331
Oh, man, am I sick.

589
00:44:55,639 --> 00:44:59,097
<i>Here's a special bulletin
from police headquarters.</i>

590
00:44:59,176 --> 00:45:00,609
<i>A little more than
an hour ago,</i>

591
00:45:00,678 --> 00:45:03,511
<i>Police discovered
the body of Pete Hallon,</i>

592
00:45:03,581 --> 00:45:06,812
<i>a petty hoodlum and former
acquaintance of Vincent Ryker.</i>

593
00:45:07,251 --> 00:45:09,116
<i>The body was found
in a car believed to be</i>

594
00:45:09,186 --> 00:45:12,246
<i>the one stolen by Ryker
during his daring escape</i>

595
00:45:12,323 --> 00:45:14,757
<i>from San Quentin
three days ago.</i>

596
00:45:15,092 --> 00:45:19,222
<i>A note of mystery was added as newsmen
reported the presence of some men</i>

597
00:45:19,363 --> 00:45:23,595
<i>with strange instruments who were carefully
handling the car and Hallon's body.</i>

598
00:45:24,735 --> 00:45:28,227
<i>Chief of Police Jensen
was unavailable for comment.</i>

599
00:45:30,207 --> 00:45:31,333
Yeah?

600
00:45:31,509 --> 00:45:33,841
I just heard, Vince.
What are you trying to do?

601
00:45:33,911 --> 00:45:35,970
Look, Eddie,
don't cry over bums.

602
00:45:36,047 --> 00:45:37,605
<i>Well, you didn't
have to kill him.</i>

603
00:45:37,681 --> 00:45:39,876
Vince, you'll have
to get out of town.

604
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:41,645
<i>Don't start that again.</i>

605
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:43,744
Do you know what
you've done? The cops...

606
00:45:43,821 --> 00:45:46,449
Cops! Cops! Look, I'm sick
of hearing about cops.

607
00:45:46,524 --> 00:45:49,152
This cold is killing me,
my nose is even bleeding.

608
00:45:49,226 --> 00:45:52,389
Cold! Nosebleed!
Listen to me, Vince...

609
00:45:52,463 --> 00:45:54,590
<i>Shut up, will you?</i>

610
00:45:56,867 --> 00:46:01,031
Look, I don't have any wheels, so...

611
00:46:01,105 --> 00:46:05,269
So why don't you pick me up in a half hour,
and get me some penicillin or something.

612
00:46:05,342 --> 00:46:08,573
That wouldn't be very smart,
my picking you up, I mean.

613
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:11,378
<i>Look, what're you trying
to pull, Eddie?</i>

614
00:46:11,449 --> 00:46:14,384
Use your head, Vince.
We're both in this.

615
00:46:14,452 --> 00:46:17,512
I'm the only chance we've got
to keep out of it. Believe me.

616
00:46:17,588 --> 00:46:18,850
<i>Eddie, I told you that I...</i>

617
00:46:18,923 --> 00:46:19,947
Listen to me!

618
00:46:21,692 --> 00:46:24,593
The car, the car's
got to get tabbed.

619
00:46:24,662 --> 00:46:26,095
<i>I stripped the car.</i>

620
00:46:26,163 --> 00:46:28,723
The motor number, it can
be traced through the...

621
00:46:28,799 --> 00:46:30,858
DMV doesn't have a record
of it here, Lieutenant.

622
00:46:30,935 --> 00:46:33,165
Ah, naturally.
Call Sacramento.

623
00:46:33,237 --> 00:46:34,795
Ask them to relay
the information directly

624
00:46:34,872 --> 00:46:37,397
to the police of the resident
city and have them contact us.

625
00:46:37,475 --> 00:46:38,499
That'll save
a little time.

626
00:46:38,576 --> 00:46:39,804
Yes, sir.

627
00:46:58,195 --> 00:46:59,457
Oh!

628
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:01,498
So I like beautiful
things.

629
00:47:01,565 --> 00:47:02,862
Thank you.

630
00:47:03,467 --> 00:47:06,994
Jeannie, be the boss for a
while. I'll be back about 2.30.

631
00:48:27,451 --> 00:48:28,451
Send out another one.

632
00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:30,646
No, I'm sorry. Lieutenant
Richards has no comment.

633
00:48:30,721 --> 00:48:32,518
Yes? Oh, I'm sorry.

634
00:48:33,224 --> 00:48:34,919
You'll have to get that
information from the chief's office.

635
00:48:34,992 --> 00:48:36,755
Right. And I've got it.

636
00:48:38,295 --> 00:48:40,422
Hank, check the reports
from General Hospital.

637
00:48:40,497 --> 00:48:41,759
Yes, sir.

638
00:48:42,499 --> 00:48:43,659
Still the same?

639
00:48:43,734 --> 00:48:44,860
Yeah.

640
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:48,600
I want all of Hallon's clothes
and effects immediately.

641
00:48:48,872 --> 00:48:49,896
Still the same.

642
00:48:49,974 --> 00:48:52,169
Nothing new
on this end either.

643
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,261
Well, this is
Hallon's stuff.

644
00:50:58,569 --> 00:51:00,867
The clothes had
a very low count.

645
00:51:02,906 --> 00:51:07,741
But by the nail head
of these shoes,

646
00:51:08,145 --> 00:51:10,705
we figure he was
exposed about an hour.

647
00:51:11,949 --> 00:51:15,112
Oh! Yes, I think
we have this style.

648
00:51:15,185 --> 00:51:17,119
I'll check in the back.

649
00:53:42,499 --> 00:53:43,523
You look...

650
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:47,696
Sick? You make me sick,
Eddie. Where've you been?

651
00:53:47,938 --> 00:53:51,101
You're... Getting
excited about nothing.

652
00:53:51,174 --> 00:53:54,200
Just like you when you glom onto
this, huh? Where've you been?

653
00:53:54,278 --> 00:53:58,009
Getting a suit altered.
Shirt, socks, the works.

654
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:02,783
Ticket to Miami.
You leave at 11.00 tonight.

655
00:54:06,523 --> 00:54:09,492
You'd like
that, wouldn't you?

656
00:54:10,127 --> 00:54:12,027
You'd really like that.

657
00:54:12,696 --> 00:54:14,596
You'd like to handle
this too, huh?

658
00:54:14,665 --> 00:54:16,826
Well, I'm going to stay,
whether you like it or not.

659
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,835
Look, Vince, I've been
trying to get along with you.

660
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,962
It's an easy ride
for a half a million.

661
00:54:22,039 --> 00:54:24,337
That stuff is dead
in this town.

662
00:54:25,108 --> 00:54:26,871
Nobody'll touch
you but me.

663
00:54:26,944 --> 00:54:29,208
And you know it.

664
00:54:30,414 --> 00:54:33,281
The dumbest thing
you did was to kill Pete.

665
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:35,818
The cops will be questioning
everybody who knew him.

666
00:54:35,886 --> 00:54:38,184
It isn't like you.
You're a lone wolf.

667
00:54:38,255 --> 00:54:40,689
He was a leech,
everybody knew him.

668
00:54:41,491 --> 00:54:42,617
He could have
told anybody.

669
00:54:42,693 --> 00:54:44,285
That's your word.

670
00:54:44,361 --> 00:54:46,022
Yes, it's my word,

671
00:54:46,897 --> 00:54:48,990
and the only one
you've got.

672
00:54:50,233 --> 00:54:52,565
I've got the key
to your freedom.

673
00:54:55,405 --> 00:54:56,633
You better slow down.

674
00:54:56,707 --> 00:54:59,801
No, Vince,
you slow down.

675
00:55:01,078 --> 00:55:04,013
And until you do,
I do nothing for you.

676
00:55:08,652 --> 00:55:10,643
What do you mean by that?

677
00:55:11,054 --> 00:55:14,990
You're the big shot.
I've got the experience.

678
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,850
Think about it.

679
00:55:22,432 --> 00:55:23,797
I just did.

680
00:55:37,214 --> 00:55:39,011
Lieutenant Richards.

681
00:55:39,850 --> 00:55:41,647
What? Great! Hold it!

682
00:55:42,185 --> 00:55:43,516
Get me a car.

683
00:55:44,054 --> 00:55:46,022
Uh, take this down. Yeah?

684
00:55:46,089 --> 00:55:50,253
Yellow Cab Garage.
Cab number 3-0-4-5.

685
00:55:50,794 --> 00:55:53,661
All right, wait there.
John, a hot cab.

686
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:55,698
Hank, check
this stuff out.

687
00:56:08,245 --> 00:56:09,473
Shirt.

688
00:56:12,549 --> 00:56:13,743
Shoes.

689
00:56:19,923 --> 00:56:21,083
Shoes.

690
00:56:25,529 --> 00:56:26,928
Genuine alligator.

691
00:56:34,604 --> 00:56:36,697
Look, how long are you
gonna keep the cab tied up?

692
00:56:36,773 --> 00:56:38,035
As long as necessary,
Mr. Millikin.

693
00:56:38,108 --> 00:56:39,336
I'll see that you get
a receipt for it.

694
00:56:39,409 --> 00:56:41,502
Oh, certainly, certainly.

695
00:56:41,578 --> 00:56:44,376
Ah, uh-huh,
I told you.

696
00:56:44,981 --> 00:56:47,211
Fifty or sixty pick-ups,
at least.

697
00:56:47,551 --> 00:56:48,848
I'll have to keep this.

698
00:56:48,919 --> 00:56:50,682
Well, I have to have it
back, you know, our record...

699
00:56:50,754 --> 00:56:52,051
I'll see that
you get it back.

700
00:56:52,122 --> 00:56:53,146
Yes?

701
00:56:53,223 --> 00:56:55,157
I've just talked
to the driver, Sam.

702
00:56:55,225 --> 00:56:57,557
He's a little confused
but on his way to the lab.

703
00:56:57,627 --> 00:57:00,255
The other driver that we got
has nothing to worry about.

704
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:01,330
Hmm.

705
00:57:11,775 --> 00:57:15,040
Hollywood Garage.
Yeah, right here.

706
00:57:16,213 --> 00:57:20,377
Oh, thanks. Richards.
Yes, Hank?

707
00:57:23,286 --> 00:57:26,016
You stay right there.
Notify Chief Jensen.

708
00:57:26,456 --> 00:57:30,449
Thanks. Ryker's not
smart. We're just stupid.

709
00:57:52,249 --> 00:57:53,841
Where's the manager?

710
00:57:55,018 --> 00:57:56,610
Get everyone out!

711
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,287
Watch this alley!

712
00:58:12,469 --> 00:58:14,096
Mark, this room
is burning up.

713
00:58:15,205 --> 00:58:16,604
That's Ryker's
work, all right.

714
00:58:16,673 --> 00:58:18,265
Call my office.
What?

715
00:58:18,341 --> 00:58:19,569
Somebody's
murdered...

716
00:58:19,643 --> 00:58:20,667
Just a minute.

717
00:58:20,744 --> 00:58:23,212
Call my office, tell Sergeant
Johnson what we found here.

718
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,475
How long have you
been in this room?

719
00:58:25,549 --> 00:58:28,575
I don't know.
Maybe 10 minutes.

720
00:58:28,785 --> 00:58:32,380
Get this girl to a hospital right
away for a complete check-up.

721
00:58:34,624 --> 00:58:36,285
Here, leave that with me.

722
00:58:36,359 --> 00:58:37,587
Do you think
the cobalt's in here?

723
00:58:37,661 --> 00:58:39,891
I don't know, the room
is hot enough to be.

724
00:58:48,772 --> 00:58:50,103
Mark!
Yeah?

725
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:51,934
It's been here!

726
00:58:54,044 --> 00:58:55,671
The shavings are
from that canister.

727
00:58:58,548 --> 00:59:01,517
A dead end.
Another dead end.

728
01:03:28,518 --> 01:03:31,043
Yes. Yes, yes,
I understand.

729
01:03:31,988 --> 01:03:35,014
Yes, all right.
I said, all right!

730
01:03:36,893 --> 01:03:38,622
Don't tell me.
Let me guess.

731
01:03:38,695 --> 01:03:42,153
The mayor. Blasting the whole
thing wide open, and what a mess.

732
01:03:42,232 --> 01:03:45,929
What is it? It still holds. At
1.00, he's pulling the switch.

733
01:03:46,002 --> 01:03:47,833
He's going to inform the
public of what we're up against,

734
01:03:47,904 --> 01:03:50,338
and he's going to make an appeal
to Ryker to give up the cobalt.

735
01:03:50,406 --> 01:03:51,430
He can't! He...

736
01:03:51,508 --> 01:03:54,966
"We can't jeopardize people's
lives any longer," he says.

737
01:03:55,979 --> 01:03:57,844
Oh, I know what your
feelings are, Mark,

738
01:03:57,914 --> 01:04:00,212
but we do know the
cobalt is in the city,

739
01:04:00,283 --> 01:04:02,148
and we could get the
children out at least.

740
01:04:02,218 --> 01:04:03,446
What about the panic?

741
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,044
Well, we'll try
to control it.

742
01:04:05,121 --> 01:04:06,884
Try? You'll try...

743
01:04:06,956 --> 01:04:08,321
We're going to sound
a general alert.

744
01:04:08,391 --> 01:04:11,155
As soon as the sirens go
off, we'll close up the city.

745
01:04:11,227 --> 01:04:12,819
We'll move in
and batten things down

746
01:04:12,896 --> 01:04:14,864
and try to keep
them in line.

747
01:04:14,931 --> 01:04:17,126
At 1.00, the mayor goes
on radio and television

748
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,100
to inform
the public and...

749
01:04:19,169 --> 01:04:20,796
And to make
a plea to Ryker.

750
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:23,532
Do you think Ryker's
going to believe you?

751
01:04:23,606 --> 01:04:25,039
Look, we've been
lucky so far.

752
01:04:25,108 --> 01:04:26,541
The moment
he hears that report,

753
01:04:26,609 --> 01:04:29,510
he's going to open up that
canister just to see what's inside.

754
01:04:29,579 --> 01:04:31,206
Somebody's got to
know something.

755
01:04:31,281 --> 01:04:35,081
You've tried them all. They're
all dead, except for the girl.

756
01:04:35,185 --> 01:04:38,086
I'll get her in here, I'll keep
at her until I find out something.

757
01:04:38,154 --> 01:04:39,519
There isn't time.

758
01:04:39,589 --> 01:04:42,217
I'll keep after her
until time runs out.

759
01:04:47,597 --> 01:04:48,996
Here she is,
Lieutenant.

760
01:05:02,212 --> 01:05:04,772
I don't know why you've
brought me down here again.

761
01:05:04,847 --> 01:05:07,543
But I don't like it
and I don't like you.

762
01:05:09,118 --> 01:05:10,176
Hank.

763
01:05:13,923 --> 01:05:15,083
Won't you sit down?

764
01:05:15,158 --> 01:05:17,592
I'm not going to
be here that long.

765
01:05:18,328 --> 01:05:19,625
Where's Ryker?

766
01:05:19,829 --> 01:05:21,091
I don't know.

767
01:05:21,631 --> 01:05:25,192
You were very good friends,
you were going to be married.

768
01:05:25,301 --> 01:05:26,825
I haven't seen him.

769
01:05:27,503 --> 01:05:28,765
I know you have.

770
01:05:30,373 --> 01:05:32,307
You don't know anything.

771
01:05:35,712 --> 01:05:38,772
I haven't seen him,
can't you understand?

772
01:05:39,716 --> 01:05:41,513
How did you find him?

773
01:05:42,585 --> 01:05:43,950
I haven't.

774
01:05:44,254 --> 01:05:47,314
I've never seen him.
I don't know where he is.

775
01:05:49,192 --> 01:05:50,921
Just leave me...

776
01:05:50,994 --> 01:05:52,461
Just leave me alone.

777
01:06:02,572 --> 01:06:05,871
We'd better get this girl to
the hospital right away, Mark.

778
01:06:05,942 --> 01:06:07,807
Hank, emergency.

779
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:30,925
Mr. Justin!
What's going on in there?

780
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,194
Go away.

781
01:06:32,268 --> 01:06:33,860
Are you drunk
or something?

782
01:06:37,473 --> 01:06:39,873
Well, you've got this room
in a fine state!

783
01:06:39,942 --> 01:06:41,341
You get out.

784
01:06:41,477 --> 01:06:42,944
Look at that!

785
01:06:43,479 --> 01:06:46,607
You'll pay for it.
I'll see to that!

786
01:06:46,783 --> 01:06:48,182
You get out.

787
01:06:48,251 --> 01:06:50,185
Going around
breaking up things!

788
01:06:50,253 --> 01:06:52,016
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself!

789
01:06:52,088 --> 01:06:54,420
You get out, or I'll
kill you, you old witch.

790
01:07:05,468 --> 01:07:06,526
Dr. Wallace?

791
01:07:06,602 --> 01:07:07,899
Yes. Dr. Perrin?
Yes.

792
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:08,994
Lieutenant Richards.

793
01:07:09,072 --> 01:07:10,369
How do you do?
How do you do?

794
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,440
Is it what we thought?

795
01:07:11,507 --> 01:07:13,634
Oh, yes. It's
a very high count.

796
01:07:13,710 --> 01:07:16,076
That girl is
in serious condition.

797
01:07:16,145 --> 01:07:18,875
I see. Well, remember, Doctor,
this is in strict confidence.

798
01:07:18,948 --> 01:07:20,438
Oh, yes, of course.

799
01:07:35,865 --> 01:07:37,799
Do you know
what this is?

800
01:07:38,201 --> 01:07:39,600
It's a Geiger counter.

801
01:07:39,669 --> 01:07:42,365
That clicking means that you
have radioactive poisoning.

802
01:07:42,438 --> 01:07:44,736
I just fainted.

803
01:07:44,807 --> 01:07:45,967
Oh...

804
01:07:46,042 --> 01:07:47,976
You're a very
sick girl.

805
01:07:48,745 --> 01:07:49,905
What do you mean?
I'm not sick.

806
01:07:49,979 --> 01:07:50,979
Yes, you are.

807
01:07:51,047 --> 01:07:54,346
Miss Marlowe, you have
radioactive poisoning.

808
01:07:54,851 --> 01:07:57,081
Ryker thinks he has
heroin in that canister.

809
01:07:57,153 --> 01:08:00,281
But it isn't heroin.
It's radioactive cobalt-60,

810
01:08:00,356 --> 01:08:03,154
and it's killing him. Do you
understand? It's killing him.

811
01:08:03,226 --> 01:08:05,888
No, you're lying...

812
01:08:05,962 --> 01:08:09,056
You're a very sick
girl, but Ryker is dying.

813
01:08:09,132 --> 01:08:11,157
If we get to him soon enough,
there's a chance we can save him.

814
01:08:11,234 --> 01:08:13,361
A slim chance,
but a chance.

815
01:08:13,503 --> 01:08:15,164
To throw him
back into prison?

816
01:08:15,238 --> 01:08:18,036
Look, I don't know
how much you love him,

817
01:08:18,107 --> 01:08:20,439
but even prison is
better than death.

818
01:09:23,739 --> 01:09:25,206
He's here, all right.

819
01:09:28,511 --> 01:09:32,072
We can't stay in here longer
than a couple of minutes, Mark.

820
01:09:32,148 --> 01:09:33,513
He's gone!

821
01:09:36,118 --> 01:09:37,142
Get everybody
out of here.

822
01:09:37,220 --> 01:09:39,415
I don't want anyone near.
Call for more units,

823
01:09:39,489 --> 01:09:41,354
I want this whole
area roped off.

824
01:10:39,482 --> 01:10:41,074
<i>HDQ to all units.</i>

825
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:42,947
<i>You are instructed
not to approach suspect</i>

826
01:10:43,019 --> 01:10:44,919
<i>until the arrival
of proper personnel.</i>

827
01:10:44,987 --> 01:10:48,548
<i>Unit 11 to HDQ. Have
received instructions. Over.</i>

828
01:10:53,062 --> 01:10:54,290
Coffee.

829
01:10:54,363 --> 01:10:55,762
Yeah, yeah, sure.

830
01:11:20,022 --> 01:11:21,717
That'll be a dime.

831
01:11:30,466 --> 01:11:33,594
Hey, what's the matter?
You sick or something?

832
01:11:42,545 --> 01:11:45,275
<i>We interrupt this program to
bring you a special broadcast</i>

833
01:11:45,348 --> 01:11:47,316
<i>from Mayor Benjamin Garrett.</i>

834
01:11:47,383 --> 01:11:50,511
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
His Honor, Mayor Garrett.</i>

835
01:11:50,586 --> 01:11:52,986
<i>My fellow citizens... Those
guys, they can talk anytime.</i>

836
01:11:53,089 --> 01:11:54,886
<i>It is my unhappy duty
to inform you</i>

837
01:11:54,957 --> 01:11:57,790
<i>of a grave and immediate
crisis in our city.</i>

838
01:11:57,860 --> 01:12:03,730
<i>I ask you not to be alarmed. Only by our
being calm can we avert a possible disaster.</i>

839
01:12:05,101 --> 01:12:07,661
<i>A few days ago, a metal container
was stolen from the prison hospital</i>

840
01:12:07,737 --> 01:12:09,466
<i>at San Quentin. Say, have you
been drinking or something?</i>

841
01:12:09,538 --> 01:12:10,869
Mind your own business.

842
01:12:10,940 --> 01:12:14,899
<i>This cylinder was believed to
contain a large supply of heroin.</i>

843
01:12:15,244 --> 01:12:19,374
<i>Instead, it actually contains
a substance known as cobalt-60,</i>

844
01:12:20,116 --> 01:12:22,380
<i>a highly
radioactive material.</i>

845
01:12:23,285 --> 01:12:26,743
<i>Cobalt-60 is one of the most
dangerous elements in existence.</i>

846
01:12:26,822 --> 01:12:31,088
Look, fella, I don't want any
sick or drunk people around here.

847
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:33,822
Maybe I'd better call
an ambulance, huh?

848
01:12:33,896 --> 01:12:35,090
<i>He is a dying man
with no hope...</i>

849
01:12:35,164 --> 01:12:38,099
Fella, please,
why don't you go, huh?

850
01:12:38,167 --> 01:12:39,395
Shut up!

851
01:12:41,904 --> 01:12:44,395
<i>I beg him not only
to save his own life</i>

852
01:12:44,473 --> 01:12:48,239
<i>but the thousands of other lives
that can become fatally contaminated</i>

853
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:52,144
<i>if the canister is opened and
the cobalt allowed to escape.</i>

854
01:12:52,448 --> 01:12:57,818
<i>Now, please listen to me. The
canister does not contain heroin.</i>

855
01:12:59,155 --> 01:13:01,282
<i>It is certain death unless
you give it up right now.</i>

856
01:13:01,357 --> 01:13:03,348
No, it's worth a million!

857
01:13:03,426 --> 01:13:07,760
<i>Vince Ryker, I beg you to do as
I ask. To all of you listening...</i>

858
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:09,798
It's a lie!
It's worth a million.

859
01:13:09,865 --> 01:13:12,561
<i>...At desperate speed
to bring Ryker to justice,</i>

860
01:13:12,635 --> 01:13:16,799
<i>and already Civil Defense units are
preparing to evacuate all children</i>

861
01:13:16,872 --> 01:13:19,170
<i>in the event Ryker
succeeds in eluding the...</i>

862
01:13:40,963 --> 01:13:43,022
Hold it!

863
01:13:50,473 --> 01:13:52,236
You're
finished, Ryker.

864
01:13:52,842 --> 01:13:56,209
No! It's not that stuff.
It's worth a million.

865
01:13:59,582 --> 01:14:02,813
It's not even worth
your life. Give it to me.

866
01:14:03,419 --> 01:14:04,886
There's still a chance
to pull you through.

867
01:14:04,954 --> 01:14:06,319
Lying...

868
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:33,039
Come on,
I want to go home.
