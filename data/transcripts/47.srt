1
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,468
I know how you feel, lady.

2
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:54,445
Just take your time
and tell me what happened.

3
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:57,915
He had this meat ax, her blood all over it.

4
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:03,187
My brother-in-law had it.
Blood all over his hands, all over his shirt.

5
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:05,687
I can't talk about it, Officer.

6
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,851
I know it's rough, lady,
but I have to have the facts.

7
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:14,298
He comes staggering out in the hall.
He says, "I did it. Call the cops."

8
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:16,125
And then he...

9
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:19,467
Snap it up, Captain.
Lieutenant Davis just blew in.

10
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,303
What's he going to do, Officer?

11
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,003
- I'm not a cop, lady.
- But you said...

12
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,610
All I said was,
"I had to ask you some questions."

13
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,079
I'm from the <i>Express.</i>

14
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:33,984
You made me go through all that.
Why, you're not decent! You're not human!

15
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:38,121
- Sorry, lady. All part of the job.
- Well, well, Lieutenant Davis.

16
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:42,252
- Say, this must have been a homicide.
- Hi, Lieutenant. Wait till you hear it.

17
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:45,092
- A messy one.
- You keep pulling stuff like this, McCleary,

18
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:50,193
and so help me, if it's the last thing I do,
I'll run you in! Now, that's a warning!

19
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,591
This is KL-75263. Get me Plaza-52099.

20
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:24,401
You know, that wasn't a bad-Iooking dame.
Too bad the guy used an ax on her head.

21
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:27,796
Spoiled some pretty pictures for me.

22
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:31,877
Hey, Mark, have you put on the gloves
with those stockholders yet?

23
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:34,203
Hi. No, I'm just taping up my hands.

24
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,976
<i>Well, you can tell them we got</i>
<i>another neat and gory one coming up.</i>

25
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,177
<i>Hatchet murder. Lower East Side tenement.</i>

26
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,652
<i>Wrapped up an exclusive interview</i>
<i>with an eyewitness.</i>

27
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:43,211
You got plenty of art?

28
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,052
Yeah. Biddle grabbed all he could
of the body.

29
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:49,185
A dame, very messy.
Got a great hysterical close-up of her sister.

30
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,828
I'll even write the caption for you.
"I seen him with a bloody meat ax."

31
00:03:53,466 --> 00:03:54,592
Good. With that, I can sell papers.

32
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:57,295
Give it to rewrite and we'll get it in the final.
Hold on. What do you want?

33
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,237
Mr. Madison called down
from the boardroom again, Mr. Chapman.

34
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:02,831
You hear that?
I'm letting them stew in their financial juices.

35
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,067
Well, don't overdo it. I like this job.

36
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,273
You've never gone backwards
with me before, have you, kid?

37
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:13,217
If we leave here, we'll bounce into
a bigger setup. I'll see you when you get in.

38
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,417
As one of the largest stockholders
in this corporation,

39
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:24,463
I would like to know
why the <i>New York Express,</i>

40
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,465
once a distinguished
and respected newspaper,

41
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:33,600
has been allowed to become
a cheap and depraved publication.

42
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:38,835
Why has an editor been allowed
to turn a decent journal into this?

43
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,613
A disgusting tabloid!

44
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,749
Pandering to the passions
of the base morons!

45
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,847
I demand an explanation, Frank Madison.

46
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:54,750
Well, Mrs. Rawley, I...
In defense of Mark Chapman, I...

47
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:58,263
Mr. Madison, I'd like to handle
my own defense, if you don't mind.

48
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,855
Just as you say, Mark.

49
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:05,428
Mrs. Rawley, I think you
and the other stockholders should know

50
00:05:05,505 --> 00:05:07,496
that your publisher hired me
as executive editor

51
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,837
with full rights to transform this newspaper.

52
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:14,443
He did this for a very simple reason.
He was fed up with operating at a loss.

53
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:18,611
Why did Mr. Madison hire me?
Well, he felt it was time that the <i>Express</i>

54
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:21,745
buried its antiquated negative approach,
such as this.

55
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,756
But who won?

56
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,920
And become a positive newspaper.
We're in a business, ladies and gentlemen,

57
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:34,695
a business of satisfying the hunger
of the public for thrills, escape and news.

58
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:39,271
Here's where I took over
your highly respectable white elephant.

59
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,172
Instead of headlining a UN story,
we gave them a vice story.

60
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,368
Obviously, they went for it.

61
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,239
We played down
the presidential appointments

62
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,644
and concentrated
on the "Gorilla Man" killings.

63
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:51,576
Here's what happened.
Thirty or forty thousand new readers.

64
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:54,245
Why, in a year, circulation's up over 110%.

65
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,686
And when we reach 750,000,

66
00:05:56,756 --> 00:06:00,886
we'll have to pay you a big bonus.
I'm not sure I like this at all.

67
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:02,761
Did you like the dividend check
you got last month

68
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,194
for the first time in 12 years?

69
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:07,323
I don't like this, sir.
What kind of journalism is this?

70
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:10,026
A newspaper
staging a cheap, vulgar display

71
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,266
in order to attract
the stupid slobs of the city!

72
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,865
The thousands who will attend
the Lonely Heart dance tonight,

73
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:18,467
these poor, friendly, unhappy people
whom you call stupid slobs,

74
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,569
buy and read this newspaper.

75
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,944
Their loyalty helped put that dividend check
in your pocket.

76
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:26,712
And I suppose you think it's a public service
when one of your reporters is arrested

77
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:30,745
for withholding information from the police?
Or whatever it was.

78
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:34,150
This, what's his name, McCleary person,

79
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,352
and the things he writes about!
I think he should be fired!

80
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,295
This McCleary person
is the best young reporter I've seen

81
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,060
in 25 years of newspapering.

82
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:43,193
Before I'll fire him,
I'll throw the <i>Express</i> up for grabs

83
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,669
and go to work for somebody
who appreciates real talent on a paper!

84
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,262
- Mark, I'm sure...
- One last thing.

85
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:50,798
The only contract I have here is a handshake
between Mr. Madison and myself.

86
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:53,141
Now, unless you give me full rights
to run this paper the way I want,

87
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,271
I'll quit after the final edition today.

88
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,784
Now, I'm sorry I can't stay with you
any longer. I have a newspaper to get out!

89
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:10,426
- Your story ready, Miss Allison?
- I'll have the rest in a minute, Joey.

90
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,831
Mr. Chapman?

91
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:17,696
Thanks.

92
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,937
McCleary story in yet, Bax?

93
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,885
How'd you make out in the torture chamber?

94
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,450
This is good. Give it a big play.
Mac'll do a byline follow-up tomorrow.

95
00:07:40,526 --> 00:07:43,825
- What are these?
- Pics for that Lonely Heart spread.

96
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:45,820
- Junk them.
- But I...

97
00:07:45,898 --> 00:07:47,092
Take Peters off the Lonely Hearts.

98
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:48,997
He's photographing these slobs
like a lineup in a soup kitchen

99
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,660
instead of panting for a red-hot romance.

100
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:52,533
- Okay. But I...
- Yeah?

101
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,566
Yes, Mr. Madison.

102
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,611
- Get an ax, smear it with blood.
- Yeah? Whose?

103
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,171
Yours. If you can't spare any,
use chocolate syrup or something.

104
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:07,652
Chocolate? Goody! When I'm through,
I can make a plate of fudge. Drop in.

105
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:12,157
So, you still insist a woman having 20 kids
is worth a feature article?

106
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,422
Hi, genius.
I think it's worth a whole front page.

107
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:18,391
It scares me, this maternal instinct of yours.

108
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:20,955
Decided where you're taking me
to dinner tonight?

109
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,966
If Chapman hasn't been canned,

110
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,169
you're going to dine with the worst loser
who ever paid off a bet.

111
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,608
Then you'd better stash some
bicarbonate soda in your bag, princess.

112
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:32,837
You're gonna need it.

113
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,437
Don't count your steaks
before you hear the sizzle.

114
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,608
Well, what's the word? Are you ex or still?

115
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,880
They're not dumb enough
to throw out a winner.

116
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,650
Congratulations. I knew you'd stick
their stocks right back in their teeth.

117
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:46,555
I told them if they fired me,
McCleary would quit, too,

118
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,060
and then they'd be in real trouble.

119
00:08:49,128 --> 00:08:50,527
I wouldn't put it past them
to try and dump you

120
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:53,929
to get out of paying the bonus that's
staring them right in their glassy eyes.

121
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,331
I've got news for you.

122
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,528
I'm going to cut you in
for a piece of that bonus.

123
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,298
What do you want me to do, retire?

124
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,566
I thought we could make a deal with Madison

125
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,698
to buy some of the company's stock.

126
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,901
You know, kid,
we could end up owning this newspaper.

127
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,536
- Well, that's the best offer I've had all week.
- I'll make you another one.

128
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:09,080
I'll take you to dinner tonight.
You pick the spot.

129
00:09:10,349 --> 00:09:14,012
I'll make you a better offer.
My date's buying. She lost a bet.

130
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:17,544
The Grand Duchess from Vassar again?
The way I feel, I can put up with anything.

131
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,818
- I'm more worried, can she put up with you?
- Get her ready.

132
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:24,124
We've got to be at the ballroom at 8:00.
There's no time for nose powder.

133
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:32,597
Don't break your ears with that grin.
I can see. He's still in.

134
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:36,532
- No loud whoops of joy, baby?
- Well, I tried everything.

135
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:39,770
I crossed my fingers,
said prayers, burned candles.

136
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:43,713
- Who's your tailor, princess?
- Let's get out of here.

137
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,075
I've had to look at that Chapman face all day.

138
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:50,714
I've got to cover his fiasco tonight
and suffer some more.

139
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,987
At least just looking at you for an hour
will be a welcome change.

140
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,496
- Lf you're taking me to dinner, let's go.
- Taking him?

141
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,195
Wait a minute.
Our bet was between you and me.

142
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,463
Our bet was loser buys dinner.
We didn't say for how many.

143
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:06,994
- Why, you double-crossing...
- I knew you'd be a good loser.

144
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:10,807
Someday remind me to tell you about girls.

145
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,248
You talk a couple of these suckers
into getting married.

146
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:21,581
These Lonely Heart slobs got the gimmies,

147
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:23,519
and we've got plenty to give them
from the advertisers.

148
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,284
If you talk one couple
into getting married by 9:00,

149
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,883
by 12:00 we'll have a dozen lined up
for wedded bliss.

150
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,155
- McCleary, the Brooklyn cupid.
- McCleary, the human yes man.

151
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:31,594
Hey, Julie!

152
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,155
- Hello, Charlie.
- Charlie.

153
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:38,225
- How are you, Barnes?
- Fine, Mark. You're looking fit. McCleary.

154
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:39,595
Thank you.

155
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,799
What goes on? Are you ghosting
Allison's features, Charlie?

156
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,774
No, he's helping me with research
for that series

157
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,640
on historical monuments in New York.

158
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,872
You couldn't pick a better man.
I ought to know.

159
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,006
Remember those old days, Mark?

160
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:53,813
Like the time I cut the phone cables
at the Lindbergh trial?

161
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,520
You scooped me. Almost cost me my job.

162
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:59,957
Scooped you, the wire services,
scooped everybody. That was the year...

163
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:02,358
That was the year you won the Pulitzer Prize.

164
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:06,826
Listen, Mark.
This stuff I've been doing for Julie, it's...

165
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:13,200
- Mark, I think I'm ready to go back to work.
- That's fine. I'm glad to hear it, Charlie.

166
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,164
How about it, Mark? How about a job?

167
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,510
- Why not?
- Thanks.

168
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:25,447
- Charlie, I'm so proud of you!
- This is gonna take a little juggling.

169
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,849
I won't be able to do anything right away.

170
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,978
Look, Charlie, I'll call you.
We're late, we gotta rush.

171
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:31,785
Sure, Mark, I know how it is,
always on the go.

172
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:35,258
- Coffee in the morning? Skinners?
- Sure thing, Julie.

173
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,257
All the time I thought you were a...

174
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,699
- How much did you give him?
- $10. He earned it.

175
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:44,929
Ten bucks?

176
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,336
- Buy a lot of whiskey.
- Did you see that rum-dumb?

177
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:49,806
- Come midnight, he'll be in the gutter.
- Now, wait a minute.

178
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,274
He's an alky, Julie.
You shouldn't give an alky

179
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:52,367
more than a buck at a time.

180
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:55,414
You're liable to kill him.
Ten bucks, he can take a bath in it.

181
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,314
But... Well, this job
will change everything for him.

182
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,319
Job? I wouldn't have him in my office,
let alone on my staff.

183
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:04,117
In you go, sucker. Where are you going?

184
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,085
I'm not going to let him go off believing this.

185
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:10,617
- Do you want to break his heart?
- Do I? What do you think you're doing?

186
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:13,358
I'm giving him hopes and dreams.
A rummy like that lives on dreams.

187
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:17,061
- He's happy. Why spoil it?
- Happy? Happy like your Lonely Hearts,

188
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,798
looking forward to those big romances
they've been promised?

189
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:23,069
- Only Charlie's romance is with a bottle.
- Get in.

190
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:48,057
Biddle, don't leave that camera at half mast.
Stop goldbricking on the other guys.

191
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:52,127
I must have got 100 shots already,
Mr. Chapman. My arm's giving out.

192
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:56,334
You've only started. I want shots of people
from every state. Now start shooting.

193
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:01,038
How are you doing, princess?

194
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:04,116
Well, it's an effort,
but I'm trying to keep from screaming.

195
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:06,981
You were a real bundle of laughs
during dinner, too.

196
00:13:07,052 --> 00:13:08,781
Why don't you simmer down now?

197
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,515
You're not so pretty
when your feathers are all ruffled.

198
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:13,183
Don't, Steve. I'm in no mood for levity.

199
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:17,491
- Do you feel like dancing?
- Do you figure that'll smooth my feathers?

200
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:21,691
I've got a great idea for you. Grab yourself
one of these Lonely Heart boys.

201
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:25,066
Tell him you're a club date. Con him.
Get his life history.

202
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,903
- And there's your feature for tomorrow.
- Mark Chapman, Junior.

203
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,568
It'll sell papers, you left that out.

204
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,871
Happy hunting, cupid.
Mustn't let the boss down.

205
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:38,312
Save at least one dance for me, princess.

206
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:58,034
Every time I aim my lens
at one of these walking zombies,

207
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:01,334
I think of the time
I covered the Miss America contest.

208
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,705
The tears almost start to flow.

209
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:09,370
From McCleary, you get nothing but service.
Ten minutes before 9:00,

210
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:13,179
and couple number one. Mary and Joe
met in front of the Arkansas booth.

211
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:16,221
It was love at first sight, almost. Right?

212
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:20,349
Well, sure. I'm from Texas,
but I sure love that Arkansas cooking.

213
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,890
- You love her, don't you?
- Well, sure, I reckon so.

214
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,158
- Mary, you love him?
- Yes.

215
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:31,130
- See, they're crazy about each other.
- Yeah, that's fine. Hey, Edwards.

216
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,535
We've got a romance going here.
They're ready for the orange blossoms.

217
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:36,837
- Well, how do you do? And congratulations.
- Save the teeth for the bandstand.

218
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:38,171
Get up there
and make the big announcement.

219
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:42,044
Yes, sir, Mr. Chapman.
Come with me, you lucky, lucky people.

220
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:46,842
Hey, you ain't gonna forget about the bed
with the built-in television set?

221
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,614
You'll spend your honeymoon in front of it.

222
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:55,321
- Nice going, Steve, keep punching.
- I'll get the camera boys up to cover it.

223
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:01,862
- Did you find a feature to write about yet?
- I haven't, and I don't intend to.

224
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,435
This bribing of poor, ignorant dopes
into a public wedding

225
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,665
is cheap, cruel and disgusting.

226
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,573
This whole Wild West show is ridiculous,
and I want no part of it.

227
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,305
Miss Allison,
your contract has six months to run.

228
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:17,281
My contract was made with Mr. Madison
before you took over the <i>Express.</i>

229
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,543
If you don't like the way I run the paper,

230
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,245
I have an agreement
that might be satisfactory to both of us.

231
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,811
Take six months' vacation with pay!

232
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:30,286
No, thank you, Mr. Chapman. I'll work it out.
I like my feature writing.

233
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,898
Thinking people like it, too,

234
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:37,561
even though there aren't many of them
buying the <i>Express</i> anymore. Good night!

235
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,605
That's it.

236
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:53,613
<i>Friends, brothers and sisters</i>
<i>in the Lonely Hearts Club.</i>

237
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,677
<i>I have wonderful news for you,</i>

238
00:15:55,754 --> 00:15:59,747
<i>living proof that this magnificent club</i>
<i>is more than just a name.</i>

239
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:04,386
<i>But first, how would you like to meet</i>
<i>the great man who created your club?</i>

240
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,998
<i>Mr. Mark Chapman,</i>
<i>editor of the</i> New York Express.

241
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,665
<i>Put the spotlight on him, over there!</i>

242
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,782
<i>Now here's the wonderful news.</i>

243
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:37,056
<i>Meet Mary and Joe, two happy people</i>
<i>who came here tonight as total strangers.</i>

244
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:42,400
<i>They met, they danced, they found love.</i>
<i>They're going to get married!</i>

245
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,474
George?

246
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,041
<i>- As the first couple who fell in love tonight...</i>
- George Grant!

247
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:01,814
<i>...Mary and Joe will receive...</i>
- It is you!

248
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,752
<i>...compliments of the</i> Express...
- Charlotte.

249
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,119
<i>... a wedding night in a New York hotel...</i>

250
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,921
Finding you here...
I was so sure that you must be dead.

251
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,759
George Grant is dead.

252
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,259
Yes, I just heard.

253
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,134
- You're the...
- We can't talk here.

254
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,901
We can talk at my place, George.

255
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:23,036
We've got a lot to talk about.

256
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,509
Go on out. I'll meet you at the side entrance.

257
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,151
The years have been kinder to you.

258
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,621
What is it, 19, 20?
I used to keep track, but I don't...

259
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,716
What's the difference?
Now that you found me, what do you want?

260
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,401
May I?

261
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:07,375
- Come on, quit stalling around.
- What was it they called you at the ball?

262
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,977
- Mark?
- Chapman.

263
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,755
When did you change your name, George?
Right after you left me?

264
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:18,962
So I wouldn't find you?

265
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,292
You knew I was so crazy about you

266
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:24,028
I'd look and look and look,
didn't you, George?

267
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,697
Come on, get to it. What do you want?

268
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:32,574
You're still in a hurry, aren't you?
That's the thing I remember best about you.

269
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:37,645
The fellow who always ran and never walked.
Had to get places fast!

270
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:43,749
And you got places, didn't you, George?

271
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:46,883
Here, you need some money?
Here's some for now.

272
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,860
Money? The payoff, George?

273
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:54,497
How much? How much for each year?

274
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:58,633
How much for the agony
and the heartbreak and the fear?

275
00:18:58,704 --> 00:19:03,141
- Charlotte, cut the ham act.
- This could be for the doctor bill, see?

276
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:10,173
I was 20 years younger then,
took things more seriously.

277
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,142
I can't imagine how much.

278
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,087
You're boring me now, like you always did.

279
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,388
People always bored you

280
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,155
when you didn't have
any more use for them, didn't they, George?

281
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:25,025
Bores and nuisances, I get rid of them.

282
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:27,497
Yeah, the same gentle way
you got rid of me.

283
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:28,692
My lawyer will get in touch with you.

284
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:31,702
He'll arrange a quiet divorce
and generous alimony.

285
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,671
You're an important man now,
aren't you, George?

286
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,038
Editor of the <i>New York Express.</i>

287
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:43,346
I never thought I'd be the wife of the editor
of a big New York newspaper.

288
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:47,112
You're not, and don't get any ideas
about forcing yourself.

289
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:51,020
You've got nothing to gain by refusing me
a divorce now like you did 20 years ago.

290
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:56,759
I was young then and so foolishly in love.
I wanted so much to hold onto you.

291
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,021
I made all of my mistakes when I was young,
and you were the biggest one.

292
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,794
I fell for an attractive hunk of flesh.

293
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:07,627
"Hold me." You didn't try to hang on.
You strangled me.

294
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,936
I'd smother to death with you.

295
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:19,808
Turnabout's fair play.
When you walked out on me, I died inside.

296
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,116
When I walk out of here, you're gonna die.

297
00:20:23,188 --> 00:20:27,852
Everything you worked for, grabbed for,
ruined people to get, it's all gonna die!

298
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,393
You're a neurotic screwball!

299
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:33,955
I'm gonna spread your story all over town.
Mark Chapman, the great editor!

300
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:37,829
Wife deserter!
Living under a false name for 20 years.

301
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:42,334
What else did you cover up
living under a phony name?

302
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,637
Your publishers are gonna love this.

303
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:49,044
And the other papers, they'll cut you
to ribbons with this information!

304
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,470
Hi, honey, let me have the city room.

305
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:37,179
This is Elkins.
If you need me, I'm over in Skinners.

306
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:41,808
What? Having breakfast. Yeah, breakfast.

307
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:53,323
Yes, Julie, after that fortunate
and historical meeting with Mark yesterday,

308
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:57,629
I had considerable difficulty
wooing the fickle Morpheus.

309
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,939
That explains it.
Those bleeding eyes today.

310
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,341
Well, I did have a couple
with the boys down below.

311
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:08,277
A sort of celebration, and then farewell.

312
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,574
You should have left them long ago, Charlie.

313
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:15,916
Any man who was big enough
in his day to rate that,

314
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:20,389
a place in Skinner's Hall of Fame,
is still too big for Dead-End Street.

315
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:25,028
No regrets, Julie. My temporary alliance
with the denizens of the Bowery

316
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:29,863
has provided me with a deeper insight
into the whys and wherefores of mankind.

317
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,006
A proven medical fact,
when the human system

318
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,840
has been lengthily nurtured
on alcoholic stimulants,

319
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:44,871
any abrupt cessation of same
will result in a negative reaction.

320
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:46,381
Absolutely.

321
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:52,385
But I'm tapering off. I'll be a firmly-rooted
passenger on the old water wagon

322
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,856
by the time Mark's ready for me.

323
00:24:57,295 --> 00:25:01,561
Charlie, don't bet everything
on Mark Chapman.

324
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:06,666
He won't let me down.
First time I felt ready, I asked him for a job,

325
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:10,032
and what happened?
He offered me one, didn't he?

326
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,173
- Mr. Lonely Heart.
- Compliments of the <i>Express,</i> Myrtle.

327
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:18,545
- I see you read. You stick with the radio.
- Yeah.

328
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:20,744
Hey, McCleary,
I read that rag of yours by accident.

329
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:23,287
Yeah, me, too.
From ax murder to Ionely hearts.

330
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,653
What are you trying to prove,
you're versatile or something?

331
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:27,885
What are you gentlemen
reading our rag for?

332
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:30,427
Trying to find out
what's happening that's news?

333
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:32,929
Good morning, kiddies. What's the word?

334
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,624
Silly, that's the word.

335
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,635
Still a heaping bunch of joy,
aren't you, princess?

336
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:43,663
Lonely Hearts Ball. Journalism has certainly
changed since the old days.

337
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:47,302
What happened to you last night?
Pulled a fast fade on me.

338
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,712
- Don't tell me you actually missed me?
- I needed protection.

339
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:53,250
Some of our love-hungry subscribers
got mixed up.

340
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:56,014
They were offering me deep-freezes
and vacuum cleaners.

341
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:59,318
- I'm surprised you refused.
- How do you know I did?

342
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,849
Certainly heavy coverage
on the unrequited passion set.

343
00:26:03,261 --> 00:26:06,924
Our love and romance edition, Charlie.
Even the crossword puzzle.

344
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,966
But nothing from the Allison corner.

345
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:12,335
Not interested in romance, Julie?

346
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:16,465
Not the kind that blossoms
on free gas stoves and television sets.

347
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:21,235
- About that Lonely Heart gag, I've got a...
- Steve, on the radio.

348
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:27,652
- Julie. Hi, Charlie.
- Hi, Biddle.

349
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:31,086
Police call. Dead dame in a flat
on Third Avenue. Are you interested?

350
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:33,090
Well, she'd probably be a cheerful change.

351
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:36,685
I'm still getting the icebox treatment
from the female on my left.

352
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:40,162
After them scarecrows I shot last night,
I figure my luck's gotta change.

353
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:43,428
Even dead, this dame's bound
to have more glamour.

354
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,467
Let's give her a look.

355
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:48,801
Thanks for the coffee, kitten.

356
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,785
Another scarecrow. I'm batting goose eggs.

357
00:27:05,323 --> 00:27:07,848
Dames have got to make trouble
even when they die, don't they, pal?

358
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:11,384
Yeah, water downstairs and water upstairs.

359
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,531
Probably wanted a room
with a swimming pool.

360
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,866
Hey, Davis, what are you doing here?

361
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:21,031
I just wanted to see if I couldn't get
to one of our calls before you did.

362
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:22,471
This isn't a homicide?

363
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,531
We got a new man
on the beat here, McCleary.

364
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,167
He's built like you between the ears.

365
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:29,975
He saw a hole in the back of the dame's head
and figured she was slugged.

366
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:31,515
What's your guess, Lieutenant?

367
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,949
She put the hole
in the back of her head herself?

368
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,783
Yeah, wise-eyes, that's it. That's it exactly.

369
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:40,291
She slipped in the tub
and opened her skull on a faucet.

370
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:43,953
- What was the lady's name, Sherlock?
- The landlady says Jane Jones.

371
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,360
- Do you believe it?
- Yeah, I believe it.

372
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:47,762
I'm fresh out of nursery school.

373
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:52,402
Jane Jones, alias Jane Doe.
Say, Dave, you're really humming.

374
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:56,401
Look, nuisance, if you so much as make
these bedsprings squeak once again,

375
00:27:56,474 --> 00:28:00,308
- I'll throw you in the tub with the dame.
- Lieutenant, please.

376
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:08,177
You're wrong, Dave.
She was murdered. Clear as your head.

377
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,347
Murdered for her money.

378
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:13,949
Why, this lady must have spent easily
six or seven dollars a year on clothes.

379
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,492
Why don't you go home, McCleary?

380
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,462
There's nothing around here
to interest a big newsman like you.

381
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,827
Look, junior, keep your nose
in your own business, or I'll run you in

382
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:31,137
- for obstruction, suspicion and vagrancy.
- Why, sure, Dave.

383
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,837
I just thought there might be something
in here to help identify her.

384
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,243
No suitcase, huh?

385
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,715
- In there, boys.
- Okay, Steve, I got all I need.

386
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,957
Thanks, Dave.

387
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:52,062
- No, not you two again.
- What do you guys do,

388
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,758
smell these things
before the police call is even in?

389
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:57,301
Try to forget your mugs.
There's a lady in the bathroom.

390
00:28:57,368 --> 00:29:00,531
- Yes, so knock before entering.
- Coming through.

391
00:29:10,381 --> 00:29:12,406
- What'd you pinch that for?
- Look familiar?

392
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:15,544
I had them in front of me all night, didn't I?

393
00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,747
Hey, that's off a Lonely Hearts badge!

394
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:22,554
Yeah. How many pictures
did you and the boys take at the ball?

395
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:24,925
Three, maybe four hundred. I don't know.

396
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,260
Rush the print of Miss Bathtub
through the lab.

397
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:28,594
Then check it against the others.

398
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,964
- See if you can match them up, okay?
- Sure.

399
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:34,937
- Shouldn't take more than a week.
- Yeah, but I want it done in an hour.

400
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:36,701
- I'll see you at the office.
- Where are you going?

401
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,903
I'm gonna hitch a ride to the morgue.
If you match them, call me.

402
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,674
How about a ride to the morgue, Pete?

403
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,096
Hey, Needle Nellie, anybody home?

404
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:08,662
Hey, handsome.

405
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:11,271
- How you doing, sweetheart?
- Doing all right, handsome.

406
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,037
Come here and give us a kiss.

407
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,815
- How's business at the morgue, Nellie?
- Dead.

408
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,178
Business is dead.

409
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,621
- It's good to see you, handsome.
- Likewise, sweetheart.

410
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,385
A long time between dates.

411
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:30,621
But right now,
I come seeking your expert female advice.

412
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:34,131
Anybody that's lived as long as me
can give it. Shoot.

413
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:37,565
Nellie, if you had just one dress
to your name

414
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,535
and you'd fastened something onto it
with a safety pin,

415
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:40,969
and maybe you were in a hurry,

416
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,008
would you take time to undo the pin,
or would you rip the whole thing off?

417
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:46,305
- This is a riddle?
- No, seriously.

418
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:51,041
Well, if I had 10 dresses and the house
was burning down, I'd still undo the pin.

419
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:52,639
Any lady would.

420
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:55,485
That's what I figured.
I just wanted a woman to confirm it.

421
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:57,453
I love you, Nellie. I love you.

422
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,047
- Where you going, handsome?
- I gotta see the doc.

423
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,955
Maybe I can get you some business, Nellie.

424
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,364
Did you get those ringside ducats
I sent you?

425
00:31:11,436 --> 00:31:13,427
Steve! Yeah, it was a great fight.

426
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:15,438
Mishke really tore that Haybelly apart,
didn't he?

427
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:19,840
Had so much blood spattered on my glasses,
I missed the knockout punch.

428
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:24,175
Look, Doc,
they just brought in an accidental death.

429
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:27,047
- They're putting her in the freezer right now.
- So?

430
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:30,110
So, I'd like you to give her
the onceover for me. An autopsy.

431
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:33,646
Accidents are out of my province.
You know that, Steve.

432
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,383
It's going to be
a great World Series this year.

433
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,087
Yeah, that it is.

434
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:41,362
I don't suppose you'd be interested
in viewing the festivities from a box seat?

435
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:47,132
Are you trying to bribe a city official?

436
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,135
Right behind first base, Doc.

437
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:11,028
Yeah. Yeah, get some prints ready.
I think we've got our front page.

438
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:14,792
Well, this is your lucky day. Drop back,
I want you to mark my racing form.

439
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,766
Get the door, will you?

440
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:20,064
Yeah, and don't forget, I smoke cigars.

441
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:24,831
- Hey, Steve, let me wipe those off a little.
- Wipe them tomorrow.

442
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:32,008
Will you smile again
if I take you to dinner tonight?

443
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,847
- A little celebration coming up.
- What's the celebration?

444
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,649
Another McCleary scoop.
Getting monotonous, isn't it?

445
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:42,557
That dinner. A two-party celebration,
or are you bringing a friend?

446
00:32:42,694 --> 00:32:44,559
Just you and me alone.

447
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:47,825
I'll smile again.
What are the fragile treasures?

448
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:52,060
Very rare items.
Pictures of a dame with her mouth shut.

449
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,972
- Joey, catch the door, will you?
- All right.

450
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,270
I've been waiting a long time
for a chance to say this.

451
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,439
- Stop the presses!
- Did you get a morning-after story

452
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:05,004
on any of those couples
we married last night?

453
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:07,483
I got a story from one
of the Lonely Heart Ball guests, all right.

454
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:11,079
But she didn't get married last night.
She got murdered!

455
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:23,263
- Who is she?
- A Jane Doe. Nobody knows her real name.

456
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,996
The police think she slipped in the bathtub
and bashed her head in,

457
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:30,507
- or they did until a little while ago.
- But you knew better all the time?

458
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,941
After Doc O'Hanlon got through
cutting her up for me.

459
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:36,538
She died between 9:00 and 12:00 last night,
before she went under in the tub.

460
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:38,479
No water in her lungs.

461
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,283
Did he find anything else?

462
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:44,788
Yeah, her killer was a man, middle-aged,
fair complexion. Had brown hair.

463
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,620
O'Hanlon found that
in scraping under her fingernails.

464
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:50,593
You ran into this
just by playing a hunch, huh?

465
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:53,858
A string from a Lonely Heart badge
was on her dress in the closet.

466
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:57,628
The badge had been torn off.
I followed through from there.

467
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:04,364
Well, is this a story,
this Lonely Heart murdered after the ball?

468
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:06,805
Can you sell papers with this?

469
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:13,342
Baxter, Jordan, Allison,
get in here right away.

470
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,477
They didn't know her name, you said?

471
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,920
Well, she called herself Jane Jones.
How phony can you get?

472
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,014
We've just been struck by lightning.

473
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,025
It's a great follow-up
for the Lonely Hearts Ball.

474
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:24,118
Tell them about it, Steve.

475
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:30,997
We'll call her Miss Lonely Heart,
no other name. Alone in the city, friendless.

476
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:34,801
She went to our shindig last night,
hunting for a soul mate.

477
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:37,363
Maybe she found one, the wrong one.

478
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:39,872
Anyway, she left early,
and sometime before midnight

479
00:34:39,944 --> 00:34:41,343
she was beaten to death in her room

480
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,540
by a brown-haired, middle-aged man
of fair complexion.

481
00:34:44,615 --> 00:34:46,480
A smash follow-up is right.

482
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:49,247
The killer had a head full of brains.
Good nerves.

483
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,723
He lugged her to the bathroom,
stripped her, tossed the body in the tub.

484
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:58,520
No. No, he stood the body in the tub.
Aimed, let go!

485
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:03,190
Bang, her head cracks the faucet.
Almost perfect crime. Ordinary accident.

486
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:06,936
He's working smartly,
a guy with imagination.

487
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:10,963
He takes her slip, stockings,
washes them, hangs them up to dry.

488
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,000
He wipes his prints off everywhere.

489
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:16,274
He starts getting rid of anything
that could identify her.

490
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:18,907
He took a ring off her,
probably a wedding or engagement ring.

491
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:22,111
- How do you know that?
- Whitish circle, third finger, left hand.

492
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:25,587
- O'Hanlon spotted it at the morgue.
- All right, go on, go on.

493
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:27,954
Well, he grabs any other personal items
that might identify her

494
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:29,856
and throws them in her suitcase and blows.

495
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:32,361
- How do you know she's got a suitcase?
- Every dame's got a suitcase.

496
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,022
But there wasn't one
in Miss Lonely Heart's room.

497
00:35:34,098 --> 00:35:35,861
This'll kick up the circulation.

498
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:40,137
We can make the 5:00 edition exclusive.
Steve can do the lead story.

499
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:42,263
Jordan, I want three column cuts
of the dame's picture at the ball

500
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,433
and the murder photo.
Allison, write me a sob story,

501
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:46,568
"Miss Lonely Heart
won't be Ionely anymore."

502
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:47,736
Fine job, Steve.

503
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,303
Sure, it's a great job,
but we're gonna top it.

504
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:51,439
How?

505
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:55,513
- Bury her.
- Bury her?

506
00:35:57,555 --> 00:35:59,682
The best story I ever dug up, and he tops it.

507
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:02,157
By 5:00 tonight, Miss Lonely Heart
will be selling newspapers for us

508
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:05,923
on every street corner in Manhattan.
Now, go on, get going.

509
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:43,787
Be seeing you, Humpty.

510
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:31,269
Look, I've shown you everything in the shop.
That's the last one I've got!

511
00:38:35,513 --> 00:38:36,605
Mark!

512
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:41,217
- Mark, old boy!
- How are you, Charlie.

513
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:45,085
What distasteful mission brings you to this
unholy neighborhood, Mark, my friend?

514
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,589
I'm just looking around.
I like to keep my hand in,

515
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,124
even though I am strapped
to a desk right now.

516
00:38:48,192 --> 00:38:50,126
You wouldn't mean you're keeping
your hand in by working

517
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:51,821
on this Lonely Heart murder,
would you, now, Mark?

518
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,955
I've got a staff to take care of that for me.

519
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:56,727
You can't kid an old newshound
like me, Mark.

520
00:38:56,801 --> 00:39:00,999
Still following our old formula,
first check the hock shops for a clue?

521
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:03,336
Didn't wanna tip your hand
to those cops in there, did you?

522
00:39:03,407 --> 00:39:05,637
I tell you I'm not down here on business.
Now stop playing hawkshaw!

523
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:08,770
Let me show you Charlie Barnes
still has the master's touch

524
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,713
- when it comes to following up a lead, Mark.
- Tell me about it later, will you,

525
00:39:11,782 --> 00:39:15,684
- when you come back to work for me?
- You're afraid I'll get drunk and tip the story.

526
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:18,881
- I'm tapering off, Mark.
- That's fine, Charlie. I'll call you.

527
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:23,825
Let me work this with you, Mark. I know
this whole district from gutter to rum-heads.

528
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:26,226
Pete in the pawnshop's
an honored friend of mine.

529
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:27,992
- Yeah.
- I can get him to work with me and...

530
00:39:28,065 --> 00:39:30,898
- Hello, Charlie!
- Go away.

531
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,400
- Here, Charlie, here's something to count.
- I don't want a handout, Mark.

532
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:37,498
- I want to work.
- You can pay me later. I'll call you, Charlie.

533
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,338
Mark, let me help...

534
00:40:13,544 --> 00:40:14,704
Hang onto them, Pete.

535
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,873
We'll drop back payday
and look them over again.

536
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:26,489
Them guys should wear glasses.

537
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:29,185
They do so much looking,
but never no buying.

538
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,125
Get this for me, Pete.

539
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,356
Taking something out for a change
instead of putting it in, Charlie?

540
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,526
I admit to the novelty of the occasion, Peter.

541
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:50,109
- Hey, you didn't hock this with me.
- Doing a favor for a friend.

542
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:56,178
Them cops. You know, if someday
they should buy something from me, I'd...

543
00:40:56,253 --> 00:40:59,620
No, that'd be bad. I'd drop dead.

544
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:06,185
You know, Charlie, I ought to be
in some other kind of business.

545
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:10,497
You really meet a very poor class of people
in this business.

546
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:13,259
Not meaning anything personal,
you understand.

547
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:16,773
But I'm always dealing with people
who are in trouble,

548
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:21,608
people who gotta hock something.
People who gotta buy something cheap.

549
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:28,109
I don't like cheap things.
I never did and I never will.

550
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:34,356
I should have been big fur man, maybe,
or big jewelry man.

551
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,651
Then I could deal with rich people.

552
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:42,554
That's the kind of people
I really prefer to deal with.

553
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:47,694
- Hey! How much is on this ticket?
- Two bucks.

554
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,841
Here, sign here.

555
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:08,424
You know, sometimes they say
even the rich people aren't happy.

556
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:11,017
But how that could be, I don't know.

557
00:42:12,296 --> 00:42:15,857
Thank you, Peter.
Thank you for being in business!

558
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,433
Thank you very much.

559
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,041
A shot, Heeney.

560
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,614
You look like your blood pressure's boiling,
Charlie. What's the matter?

561
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:40,680
The classic irony of the age, Heeney.

562
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:43,659
Charlie Barnes, a stewbum,
rocking the newspaper world

563
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,457
like he never did in all his sober days.

564
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,208
- Composing.
- Yes, sir.

565
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:07,712
Yes. Yes, madam,
I have two answers for you.

566
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:11,313
First, you shouldn't talk
to strange men in bars.

567
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:13,982
Second, because he asked you to marry him

568
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:16,356
then hit you with a pretzel dish
when you refused

569
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,191
isn't conclusive proof
he's our Lonely Heart Killer,

570
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,697
but thanks for calling, lady. Bye.

571
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:26,326
Phony or not,
those tips belong to the police.

572
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:30,299
When are you going to get rid of the idea
you're wearing an invisible badge?

573
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:34,140
Julie Allison. Hello, Charlie. How are you?

574
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,181
The Lonely Heart murder?

575
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:42,844
And you've got to meet me right away.
We have to figure out how to handle this.

576
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,514
I know the killer, and it's dynamite.

577
00:43:46,757 --> 00:43:48,952
Well, Charlie,
that story is really Steve McCleary's.

578
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:52,587
- I think you'd better talk to...
- No, no, Julie, I want you to have this.

579
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:55,393
Now I can repay you, Julie child,
for everything.

580
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:59,596
Julie, this is so... It's so tremendous,
it'll put both of us on top.

581
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:04,035
What? What, Julie?

582
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,835
Okay, okay, both of you meet me.

583
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:11,540
Maybe we will need
somebody like McCleary.

584
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:14,175
Steve, Charlie says
he has information on the murder.

585
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:18,654
- He's awfully excited about something.
- About two quarts full, probably.

586
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,881
Yeah, Charlie, what's up?

587
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:25,695
I wanted Julie to have this,
but she insists you be on in it.

588
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,663
I mean you be in on it.

589
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:30,297
- What's the matter, Charlie?
- No.

590
00:44:31,368 --> 00:44:34,462
- What? You're not sore, are you?
- No, go away!

591
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,099
What? What have I got?

592
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,939
I've got the Lonely Heart Killer for you,
that's what!

593
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:44,777
Gee, Charlie, that's great.
You getting him crocked so he'll confess?

594
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:48,807
I haven't got him. I know who he is.

595
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:55,950
What?

596
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:03,465
Yes, I'm in a saloon.
I'm in Heeney's. But I'm not drunk.

597
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:07,128
I've just taken the hottest story
of the century out of hock, and I'm gonna...

598
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:11,064
He's really flying tonight.
See what your 10 bucks did?

599
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:15,009
Stop treating him like some
weak-minded child. Listen to what he's got.

600
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:19,482
- He's not this excited for nothing.
- You know what he's got? The DTs.

601
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:21,675
Charlie Barnes, tanked to the eyeballs,

602
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:24,880
says he just took the Lonely Heart
murder solution out of hock.

603
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:29,583
Hello, Charlie?
Still there? Let's start all over again.

604
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:34,788
Listen, you mental midget. The only reason
I'm calling the <i>Express</i> is Julie Allison.

605
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:37,732
Before I'd give this story
to an insolent young pup like you,

606
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:39,792
I'd take it to the <i>Daily Leader!</i>

607
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,304
Charlie's mad now.
Gonna sell it to the <i>Leader.</i>

608
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:46,069
- Hang up on the drunken slob.
- Julie? She just left.

609
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:48,570
I guess we'll just have to read your story
in the <i>Leader</i> tomorrow.

610
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:50,772
- So long, pal.
- Give me that.

611
00:45:51,815 --> 00:45:53,077
- Hello? Hello?
- Don't be silly, Julie.

612
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:55,141
He'll just keep you up all night
listening to his fairytales.

613
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:59,349
- Where was he calling from?
- Bellevue psycho ward, I think he said.

614
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,747
Your 10 bucks.

615
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:15,460
- Keep this for me, Heeney.
- Why, sure, Charlie.

616
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:17,056
A couple hours.

617
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:20,359
One more, Heeney. One for the road.

618
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,739
Hello, Charlie.

619
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,617
Mark. I thought you were still down
at the Bowery.

620
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:18,024
I hear you got a story, Charlie.

621
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:20,060
Where'd you hear that?

622
00:48:20,597 --> 00:48:25,364
- Isn't that what you told McCleary?
- Why, I was just schmoozing him, I...

623
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,295
Lining him up for a little touch.

624
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:31,432
I gave you some money.
What did you do with it?

625
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:33,333
You didn't, by any chance,
find a pawn ticket

626
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,379
- mixed in with the money, did you, Charlie?
- Pawn ticket? Why, I...

627
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:40,177
Did you use the money
to get the story out of hock, Charlie?

628
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:44,585
You've got something that belongs to me.
Where is it?

629
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:47,220
You were on the way to the <i>Leader</i>
with some evidence.

630
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:49,725
Where is it, Charlie? Where is it?

631
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:04,738
It's a wonderful story, isn't it, Charlie?

632
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:07,909
You wanted to be a big man, Mark.

633
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:12,476
This will make you famous
beyond your most ambitious dreams.

634
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:18,412
Great story?
I've waited all my life for a story like this.

635
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:23,483
Well, you've got it, Charlie.
But you're not going to write it.

636
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:30,622
You're crazy, Mark.
Twenty years you've covered the news.

637
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:33,761
Seen the bright boys try this. It never works.

638
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,587
We just heard about Charlie Barnes.
Rotten deal.

639
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:04,293
It's hard when it's someone like Charlie
you've known for 22 years.

640
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:06,164
I knew him 25 years.

641
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:10,167
I never expected to see him
laying on a slab in this place.

642
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:15,001
Is that right, Doc? Was he found
in an alleyway across from the <i>Daily Leader?</i>

643
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:17,205
- Steve...
- Yes, that's right.

644
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:20,439
The <i>Daily Leader.</i> He had a story!

645
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:23,509
But he was taking your clever,
insolent, fresh-guy advice

646
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:27,216
- and giving it to the <i>Leader!</i>
- He was drunk, Julie. How could I know...

647
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:29,656
Charlie Barnes never got so drunk
he didn't know a story!

648
00:50:29,726 --> 00:50:33,492
Or that he'd try to peddle
a phony tip to a newspaper! But you...

649
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:35,394
You couldn't bother listening to him!

650
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:38,798
You and that newsprint hero of yours,
Mark Chapman.

651
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:41,032
You couldn't expect us to believe
that Charlie Barnes

652
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:43,129
had any real information
on the murder, Julie.

653
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,231
We still don't know that he did.

654
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:49,711
If you and that stone-hearted, glory seeking,
"I am the great Mark Chapman"

655
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,771
had thrown Charlie
the miserable crumb of respect

656
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:54,510
of just listening to him, he'd be alive today!

657
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:58,748
Julie, maybe you're right.
Maybe it is partly my fault Charlie's dead.

658
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:01,882
I'm sorry. Really sorry. But what can I do?

659
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:06,123
Don't go soft! Show Chapman
you're a chip off the old block.

660
00:51:06,596 --> 00:51:08,655
Have him give Charlie a fancy funeral.

661
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,997
Great headline.
"The <i>Express</i> buries its cast-offs."

662
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:14,097
It'll sell papers!

663
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:31,912
Kenny, rewrite that one paragraph, will you?
Allison had a bad night. Yeah.

664
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:35,087
I just got yesterday's figures
from circulation, Mark.

665
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:38,491
Six hundred and ninety-six thousand.
You're moving up there.

666
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:41,292
Looks as though it's going to cost
the <i>Express</i> some bonus money before long.

667
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:44,765
Quicker than you can say,
"Good afternoon, Mrs. Stockholder Rawley!"

668
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:46,666
We're only starting,
Mr. Madison, only starting.

669
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:48,260
That's the spirit!

670
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:50,272
When you get to the editor's chair,
remember one thing.

671
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:54,743
You're a hero with a lifetime job,
as long as the circulation is rising.

672
00:51:55,045 --> 00:51:59,379
- What have you got there?
- Something that will keep circulation rising.

673
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:01,581
Charlie Barnes' story.

674
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,378
What are you talking about?

675
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:06,820
Charlie wasn't near the <i>Daily Leader</i>
by accident, Mark.

676
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,790
He had something to print.

677
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:11,419
I couldn't find it in his effects
at the morgue this morning,

678
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:15,932
but I found it at Heeney's bar,
the joint Charlie phoned from last night.

679
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:19,134
Half a pawnshop ticket was still on the bag.

680
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:21,431
Pete's Hock Shop. I checked it.

681
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:24,838
Charlie came in the pawnshop last night
with a claim check.

682
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:27,536
Said he was unhocking it for a friend.

683
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:31,743
Well, what's in the bag?
Miss Lonely Heart's name and address?

684
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:36,477
Better than that, Mark.
Much better than that.

685
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:40,579
A picture of the guy who killed her.

686
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,362
A picture?
You can't even see the guy's face!

687
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:54,596
What's the matter, Mark?
This is the first real lead we've got.

688
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,263
The way you talked,
I thought we had it all sewed up.

689
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,604
Sure, it's a lead, but it's a thin one.
How much does this give us?

690
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:04,773
Well, we're certain the dame had a husband.
They were married in 1931 in Connecticut.

691
00:53:05,248 --> 00:53:09,048
- The husband's the guy who killed her.
- How do you make that?

692
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:11,580
The ring mark on her finger
must have been a wedding ring.

693
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:14,055
The inscription inside
could have identified him.

694
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:16,388
And he grabbed the pawn ticket
figuring she'd hocked some belongings

695
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:18,893
- that might peg him.
- Makes sense.

696
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:22,194
Charlie got the pawn ticket from the killer.

697
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:25,701
He must have been with him sometime,
someplace, yesterday.

698
00:53:25,769 --> 00:53:28,329
A lot of people
could have seen them together, right?

699
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:29,770
Could have.

700
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:33,609
Splash this picture
on the front page tonight.

701
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:35,975
Offer a reward for information.

702
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:41,674
"Lonely Heart Killer strikes again."

703
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:45,246
When you write the story,
say that Barnes was working on this case

704
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:46,346
undercover for the <i>Express.</i>

705
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:49,620
He got too close to the killer
and died in the line of duty.

706
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:50,887
Mark, I don't know, it...

707
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:54,863
Nobody can deny it. It'll help sell papers.
We'll offer $1,000.

708
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:58,360
Look, kid, don't pin your hopes
on anybody being able

709
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:02,030
to spot the guy from this.
Unless they got x-ray eyes.

710
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,034
I'm sure Charlie connected
the guy in the picture

711
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:08,601
with the bird who gave him the pawn ticket.
I'm going to fine-tooth the Bowery myself.

712
00:54:08,678 --> 00:54:11,374
It's even money
that's where Charlie ran into our man.

713
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:12,972
Good luck, kid.

714
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:47,875
- Well, I got them for you, McCleary.
- Good work, Heeney.

715
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:09,634
Well, this does it. I'll never touch
another drop the rest of my life.

716
00:55:17,547 --> 00:55:19,515
'Course some of them
been sucking on the bottle all night,

717
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:21,516
but they can still stand up.

718
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:24,747
- They all knew Charlie?
- Yeah, they all knew him.

719
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:29,081
If you give McCleary here
any bum information, I'll brain you.

720
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:31,818
And I might even do worse.

721
00:55:31,961 --> 00:55:35,522
No more free shots
when you're seeing little red spiders.

722
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:40,095
How many of you boys saw Charlie Barnes
the day he was killed? Raise your hands.

723
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:44,197
All right, raise your mitts,
them that seen Charlie day before yesterday.

724
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:45,366
Good.

725
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:50,446
- Where did you see him?
- See who?

726
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:54,279
- This guy must be used to talking to mirrors.
- Charlie Barnes.

727
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:58,253
I seen him come out of a joint
where he flopped in the morning.

728
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:02,815
You, where'd you see him?

729
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:05,826
- Humpty O'Dougal's saloon.
- What time?

730
00:56:05,895 --> 00:56:10,389
In the afternoon. Late in the afternoon.
Charlie had a nice little bun on.

731
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:11,992
Was he with anybody?

732
00:56:12,068 --> 00:56:14,036
With anybody?
Sure, he was with somebody.

733
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:16,834
Charlie never drank by himself
if he had a little cash on him.

734
00:56:16,906 --> 00:56:19,966
- Well, do you know the guy he was with?
- Certainly I know who he was with.

735
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:23,206
- Well, who was it?
- Me. He sprung me three slugs.

736
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:32,678
When did you see him?
When did you see him?

737
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:38,491
- This morning.
- Throw him out of here.

738
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:41,086
- Wait a minute!
- What are you talking about?

739
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:44,691
- Now, is there any more jokers in the crowd?
- I seen him.

740
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:49,136
Yeah? Well, go on. Where'd you see him?

741
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,770
On the street near Pete's Hock Shop.

742
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:57,472
- Go on, go on.
- Nothing. He was working a sucker.

743
00:56:58,014 --> 00:57:01,177
- Giving him the pally act, that's all.
- Now think hard.

744
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:04,243
Do you remember the sucker?
Do you remember what he looks like?

745
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,754
- Maybe.
- What do you mean, "Maybe"?

746
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:10,826
- Maybe for 50 bucks.
- Why you...

747
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:15,362
Do you think you could remember
for 1,000 bucks?

748
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,258
Who could tell who he is?

749
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:22,461
Can you describe
the man you saw Charlie with?

750
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:26,273
Do I get $1,000 if I do?

751
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,968
You do. If and when we find the guy.

752
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:32,212
- Sure, I can describe him.
- Well, go ahead.

753
00:57:34,918 --> 00:57:37,819
- You paying the reward?
- No, but my boss is.

754
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:41,647
- Then I'll describe it to him.
- Okay. Come on.

755
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:44,385
Rush this over to the composing room.

756
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:48,492
Kenny, see if you can figure out
a heading for that rubbish.

757
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:50,723
Connie! Connie, take this.

758
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,806
Wait here.

759
00:58:13,623 --> 00:58:15,318
Look, Lieutenant,
just refer the captain to me.

760
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:18,189
I'll tell him he's cropping at the best
homicide man he ever had on the force.

761
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:20,491
If he doesn't know that,
he's deaf, dumb and blind.

762
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:22,861
Yeah, never mind the malarkey, Chapman!

763
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:24,900
The next time
you people pull a stunt like this,

764
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:27,596
I'll throw both you and McCleary in the can!

765
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:31,832
Okay, Lieutenant, okay.
I give you my word. Goodbye, pal.

766
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:35,340
Davis is screaming because we gave him
the suitcase only a half hour

767
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:36,878
before he read it in the <i>Express.</i>

768
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:39,437
Well, I've got something
that ought to make him happy again.

769
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,744
Not another suitcase?

770
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:44,776
A guy who can identify the man
Charlie got the pawn ticket from.

771
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,384
Hey, Bailey. Come in here.

772
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:03,561
He wouldn't describe the guy to me.
He needed the boss.

773
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:08,304
You the boss?

774
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:13,611
Yeah, and don't waste my time.
Where'd you see this guy with Charlie?

775
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:18,446
Down the street near Pete's Hock Shop.

776
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:22,151
You say you can describe him?

777
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:44,335
Well, go on. What did he look like?

778
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:55,786
Stand up, will you?

779
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:07,766
Yeah, just how I figured.

780
01:00:08,805 --> 01:00:10,432
You figured what?

781
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:15,272
He was your size,

782
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:18,678
your build.

783
01:00:19,115 --> 01:00:21,345
Could have been as old as you.

784
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:26,217
- Is that all?
- All you asked me was to describe him.

785
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:30,625
That was no description!
That could fit a million guys in this town.

786
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:34,060
- Even me.
- Well, how about the reward?

787
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:38,123
Here, take this down to the cashier
and pick yourself up five bucks.

788
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:41,261
- Show him where it is, Steve.
- Come on, Bailey.

789
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,517
Hey, Baxter, where's Julie?

790
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:34,078
She came in this morning,
banged this out on her typewriter,

791
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:36,216
and told me to give it to Chapman.

792
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:38,385
- What is it?
- Her resignation.

793
01:01:38,461 --> 01:01:42,261
I figured I'd hang onto it a day or so.
Maybe she'd cool off.

794
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:46,261
I'm sure glad you did.
I'll take care of it for you, okay?

795
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:50,762
Baxter, thanks.

796
01:02:00,883 --> 01:02:03,647
- Hello, Mrs. Allison.
- Well, hello, Steve. Come in.

797
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,051
Thank you.

798
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:14,458
I have a pot of coffee in the kitchen.
I'd better see to it.

799
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:16,564
Can I say a few words to you?

800
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:19,533
Without getting hit with a table
or something?

801
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:22,230
Speak your piece and get it over with.

802
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:25,535
I just got rocked
with a bad piece of news, Julie.

803
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,040
I heard about your resignation.

804
01:02:28,444 --> 01:02:31,845
Well, I can't imagine
why you'd shed any tears over it.

805
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,211
Well, for what it's worth,

806
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:36,308
your resigning knocks the props
out of a lot of things for me.

807
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:40,655
That couldn't have come
from Steve McCleary.

808
01:02:41,791 --> 01:02:44,851
Okay, pass it. But I didn't figure
your burn at Chapman and me

809
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:48,454
would be bigger than your wanting
to do something about Charlie's murder.

810
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:52,829
Don't start playing me
for a hollow-headed female now, Steve.

811
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:55,871
Your only interest, and Chapman's,
in Charlie's death is exploiting it

812
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:59,601
- for all the circulation jumping it's worth!
- Julie, I'm not digging on a story now

813
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:03,577
just for the school-boy bang of seeing
my name over a sensational yarn.

814
01:03:03,646 --> 01:03:06,672
Yeah, that's right, I had to get hit pretty hard
before I smartened up.

815
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:09,309
But now I'm leveling
on the Charlie Barnes business.

816
01:03:13,422 --> 01:03:18,257
Well, if I can believe what I'm hearing,
this certainly is a different McCleary.

817
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:20,955
I've been working night and day.

818
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:24,227
All I've done is run the local leads
to a dead end.

819
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:29,294
There's only one gimmick left to follow.
This picture, the marriage in Connecticut.

820
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:33,067
It's odd the person who married them
hasn't recognized it.

821
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:36,077
Unless he's dead or hasn't seen the picture.

822
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:40,310
Yeah, I thought of that angle, too.
But it's a million-to-one shot.

823
01:03:40,383 --> 01:03:43,716
A guy would have to be an elephant
to remember a face after 21 years.

824
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:48,314
Tell him about the elephant we met
on Fifth Avenue, about four years ago.

825
01:03:48,391 --> 01:03:50,791
We were walking along the street when,
right out of the blue,

826
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:53,021
a complete stranger stopped me.

827
01:03:53,095 --> 01:03:56,656
It turned out to be the little preacher
who married Julie's father and me

828
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:59,724
in Portland, Maine, 23 years before!

829
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:06,603
- And he actually was able to recognize you?
- And I'd put on a little weight since then.

830
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:10,270
They say a New Englander
seldom forgets a face.

831
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:13,813
Crazy odds, but what can we lose?

832
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:16,416
Yeah, get this picture

833
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:19,750
to every churchman, judge
and justice of the peace in Connecticut.

834
01:04:19,822 --> 01:04:24,259
- It's certainly worth trying.
- It's a big job. Compiling lists,

835
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,620
- checking out leads.
- It can be done.

836
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,687
The two of us could handle it, Julie.

837
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:32,667
Well, I'd like to, Steve, but I've resigned.

838
01:04:32,735 --> 01:04:36,637
And I'd sooner drop dead
than ask Mark Chapman for my job back.

839
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:45,803
- You dog!
- It never got past Baxter.

840
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:48,908
A list of churches in each town
is no problem.

841
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:52,318
The judges and JPs we can get
from the state legal directory in Hartford.

842
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:54,720
Yeah, you start packing.
Enough for a couple of weeks.

843
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:56,451
I'm going to the office
and get the lab boys started

844
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:57,787
on knocking out a few hundred circulars.

845
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:00,260
But suppose Chapman says no
to my working with you on it?

846
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:03,492
Why should he? Anyway, I'm not going
to tell him anything until we're ready to go.

847
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:04,658
Tonight sometime.

848
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:08,898
Mom, you think it's safe for me to travel
out of state at night with this young man?

849
01:05:08,971 --> 01:05:12,702
Just so he doesn't misconstrue
the meaning of "freedom of the press."

850
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:16,336
Hey, you wonderful woman.
I'll check with you for dinner.

851
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,544
Steve, this is shot-in-the-dark stuff.

852
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:26,452
Mark, more rabbit-brained ideas than this
have paid off.

853
01:05:26,522 --> 01:05:28,956
Your hottest lead is right here in town
where the murders were committed.

854
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:32,290
Yeah, our hottest lead was in town,
but it dried up like a puddle in July.

855
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:33,589
You're looking for a mental marvel,

856
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:36,154
a guy who can recognize somebody
he'd seen for 15 or 20 minutes

857
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:38,757
at a wedding ceremony
he performed 21 years ago.

858
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:41,394
How do we know he only saw them
for 15 or 20 minutes?

859
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:44,200
Maybe they were members of his church
or were married by a judge

860
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:46,298
or a justice in their own town.

861
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:48,605
Steve, you're off
on a needle-in-a-haystack hunt.

862
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:51,078
You can find a needle in a haystack
if you look long enough.

863
01:05:51,147 --> 01:05:53,775
You don't think I'm gonna let you
hang around up there indefinitely, do you?

864
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:55,680
You won't have to. A week, probably.

865
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:58,982
Julie Allison's coming along to help me.
It's all arranged.

866
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:02,456
It's all arranged. And that five grand reward.
You arranged that, too?

867
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:06,586
No, you did, or will.
Mark, what's eating you?

868
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:09,257
I'm only checking out every possible angle.

869
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:11,061
Kid, I don't want you to beat your brains out.

870
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:13,033
We can get just so much
out of this Lonely Hearts story,

871
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:16,128
and then we'll start easing it off
and let it die a natural death.

872
01:06:16,205 --> 01:06:19,368
Let it die? Mark, we let Charlie Barnes die!

873
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:22,909
The least we can do now is to find his killer.

874
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:26,443
You're the guy who pounded into me,
"Never give up till you've got the story."

875
01:06:26,515 --> 01:06:28,449
Well, I'm not quitting on this one
until I've licked it.

876
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:30,985
You can reach me
at the Lenox Hotel in Hartford.

877
01:06:56,579 --> 01:06:57,978
Long distance.

878
01:06:58,047 --> 01:06:59,844
I want some information.

879
01:06:59,915 --> 01:07:01,906
A telephone number
in Middlebury, Connecticut.

880
01:07:01,984 --> 01:07:05,181
The name is Hacker. He's a judge.
I don't remember his first name.

881
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:07,222
You wish to place a call to this party?

882
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:10,383
No, no. Not yet, that is.
I just want to get his telephone number.

883
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,188
<i>One moment, please.</i>

884
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:20,235
Hello? The Middlebury operator
has no listing for anyone by that name.

885
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:22,436
There isn't?

886
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:25,296
Middlebury's a small town.
Will you ask the operator

887
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:26,966
if she knows anything
about Judge Hacker at all?

888
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:29,273
Is he deceased, moved away, or what?

889
01:07:29,345 --> 01:07:31,074
<i>One moment, please.</i>

890
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:38,510
Hello? The local operator
has been in Middlebury for five years

891
01:07:38,587 --> 01:07:40,646
and knows no one
by the name of Judge Hacker.

892
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:42,384
That's all the information she can give us.

893
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:45,153
Thanks.

894
01:08:32,908 --> 01:08:35,308
No, Reverend,
I'm afraid that's not our couple.

895
01:08:36,412 --> 01:08:39,040
You may be positive, Reverend,
but you're mistaken.

896
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:41,515
The woman in the photo we sent you
is dead.

897
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:43,916
Thank you for calling, Reverend.

898
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:48,153
You don't have to tell me.

899
01:08:48,224 --> 01:08:50,852
It's written all over
your bright and shining face.

900
01:08:50,926 --> 01:08:53,759
A 190-mile drive
to have a whack-head tell me

901
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:56,423
that both the people in our circular
died a year ago.

902
01:08:57,766 --> 01:09:01,896
New Englanders remember, all right.
Every face is familiar to them.

903
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:07,671
Hello? Just a minute, here's Steve.

904
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:10,340
It's that man again. Every day.

905
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:13,313
Does he think we'll keep it a big fat secret
if we find something?

906
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:16,649
Yeah, Mark.

907
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,819
Nothing but an aching back
and some interesting meetings

908
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:22,824
with jelly-brained screwballs.

909
01:09:22,892 --> 01:09:26,555
You've had enough time, Steve. Ten days.
Admit it's a dud. Come on home.

910
01:09:26,629 --> 01:09:29,325
Two more days, Mark.
We'll stick it out to the end of the week.

911
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:33,391
Get out of the haystack. It's easier
to find the needles at the scene of the crime.

912
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:34,936
I'll see you.

913
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:39,832
Two more days. I don't even know myself
why we're sticking around.

914
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:42,772
Anything there that sounds good?

915
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:47,946
I'll read you a fair sample.
From a J.P. Waterbury.

916
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:52,451
"Send me $5,000
and I will tell you names of people."

917
01:09:52,655 --> 01:09:54,646
A new head I'll send him.

918
01:09:55,658 --> 01:09:58,320
I've got a headache.
I think I'll lie down for a while.

919
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:01,855
Why don't you lie down here?

920
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:08,998
I'll go to my room.

921
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:17,744
McCleary. Okay, put him on.

922
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:20,808
A guy calling from Franklin.

923
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:23,308
Hello? Yeah, that's right.

924
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:27,149
You do, huh?

925
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:31,590
- You've got what?
- What is it?

926
01:10:31,827 --> 01:10:35,456
- Just a minute.
- I have the other picture right before me!

927
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:41,131
Yes, I married them July 19th, 1931,
over in Middlebury.

928
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:44,702
A funny thing. What's that?

929
01:10:48,143 --> 01:10:49,872
Judge Elroy Hacker.

930
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:52,404
We'll be there in two hours, Judge.

931
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:54,244
Sit tight
and keep your mouth shut about this.

932
01:10:54,316 --> 01:10:55,374
Bye.

933
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:59,247
Go on, get packed.
He's liable to drop dead on us or something.

934
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:58,102
For a man who can sit there
and watch his success increasing daily,

935
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:00,011
you're looking much too troubled, Mark.

936
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:03,210
It's just that these minor problems
always seem to require major thinking.

937
01:12:03,285 --> 01:12:06,379
Well, perhaps we can balance
the unpleasant with the pleasant.

938
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:09,390
That conversation we had the other day
about your buying company stock.

939
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:10,823
- Yeah?
- I just thought I'd tell you,

940
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:14,920
- I think we can swing that.
- That's fine, Mr. Madison, just great.

941
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:17,659
Well, there doesn't seem to be any doubt
you'll reach that bonus figure.

942
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:19,064
It'll be pleasant having you as a partner,

943
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:20,863
- so to speak, in the paper, Mark.
- Thanks.

944
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:22,801
- Good night.
- Good night.

945
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:19,147
Sorry to keep you this late, Mark,

946
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:21,621
but we got hit with a mess of traffic
on the way in.

947
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:23,157
Your wire sounded important.

948
01:14:23,225 --> 01:14:26,456
I found that needle,
or rather the man with the needle.

949
01:14:26,528 --> 01:14:29,725
Judge Elroy Hacker,
Mark Chapman, Managing Editor.

950
01:14:29,865 --> 01:14:32,925
- Glad to meet you, Judge.
- How do, Mr. Chapman?

951
01:14:33,902 --> 01:14:35,893
- Sit down, Judge.
- Thanks.

952
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:38,672
Does the judge's needle sew anything up?

953
01:14:38,740 --> 01:14:41,231
Everything but knotting the thread
at the end.

954
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:42,937
I mean the noose.

955
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:45,240
What have you got?

956
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:48,511
The identity of Mrs. Lonely Heart
and her husband.

957
01:14:49,117 --> 01:14:51,711
Judge Hacker married them
in Middlebury, Connecticut.

958
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:54,688
Their names are Charlotte and George Grant.

959
01:14:58,827 --> 01:14:59,953
Did you get that, Mark?

960
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:03,327
The name of the Lonely Heart Killer
is George Grant.

961
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:05,530
Yeah, I heard you. Go on.

962
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:08,229
Strike two. The judge is sure
he can identify George Grant

963
01:15:08,303 --> 01:15:10,203
when he sees him again.

964
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:13,969
You see, I took this picture myself.

965
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:17,338
A little extra service
the judge gave his bridal couples.

966
01:15:17,412 --> 01:15:20,711
Yes. I'd send them a print
and put one in my own scrapbook.

967
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:22,579
The judge even furnished
the "just married" sign.

968
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:24,118
Judge, you said
you married them in Middlebury,

969
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:27,883
- but Steve found you in Franklin.
- I retired seven years ago.

970
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:31,323
I'm partial to fishing,
so I moved over on the coast.

971
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:34,928
I only happened
to see your circular by chance,

972
01:15:34,997 --> 01:15:37,830
in the office of a justice friend of mine.

973
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:43,571
I always said you were born
in a field of shamrocks.

974
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:47,769
Sure. The McClearys raised their kids
on nothing but rabbits' feet.

975
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:52,471
Judge, what makes you so sure
you can identify George Grant today?

976
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:57,250
Well, mainly because right after
I took that wedding picture,

977
01:15:57,319 --> 01:16:00,482
this Grant got vexed at his wife
about something.

978
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:05,651
I can remember his voice, snapping at her.
His face getting red...

979
01:16:07,696 --> 01:16:11,598
I know what's in your bonnet, Mark.
We still have to find George Grant.

980
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:14,363
A needle's nothing but a hunk of steel
if you've got nothing to sew.

981
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:15,801
We just need the thread.

982
01:16:15,871 --> 01:16:18,203
I figure we'll pick that up
right here in New York.

983
01:16:18,273 --> 01:16:21,367
When the police line up all the local
George Grants for the judge to look over.

984
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:27,416
That's Julie. I dropped her off
at headquarters to tell Davis what we've got.

985
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:32,618
Friend Davis is steaming
like a pressure cooker, as I said he would.

986
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:33,746
He'll simmer down.

987
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:36,484
So will your
lining up the George Grants idea.

988
01:16:36,558 --> 01:16:40,255
Davis says he'll do nothing until you turn
Judge Hacker over to the police.

989
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:42,763
- Steve, you can't hold...
- Relax, doll. He'll see the judge later.

990
01:16:42,831 --> 01:16:44,924
Not tonight he won't.
The judge is our exclusive beat.

991
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,230
Nobody gets to him
till our story breaks tomorrow.

992
01:16:47,302 --> 01:16:49,031
I don't trust cops.

993
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:52,904
You and Julie start writing the story.

994
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:56,308
I'll put the judge in a side-street hotel
where nobody will get to him.

995
01:16:56,378 --> 01:16:57,902
Come on, Judge.

996
01:17:01,316 --> 01:17:03,648
I'll just wait for Mr. McCleary.

997
01:17:04,987 --> 01:17:06,921
He was going to put me up at his place.

998
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:08,581
That's the first place
the wolves will start baying.

999
01:17:08,657 --> 01:17:10,921
You better come with me, Judge.

1000
01:17:10,993 --> 01:17:15,157
No, I don't think it would be wise
for me to go with you, Mr. Grant.

1001
01:17:15,731 --> 01:17:18,325
- Mister...
- Chapman, Judge. Not Grant.

1002
01:17:18,734 --> 01:17:21,294
You'd better give your brain a rest.
You're gonna need it.

1003
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:22,735
He may be Chapman now,

1004
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:27,104
but 21 years ago, when I married them,
he was George Grant.

1005
01:17:27,509 --> 01:17:29,534
And he was a newspaperman.

1006
01:17:30,379 --> 01:17:34,145
I remember now. He said he worked
on the paper over in Waterford.

1007
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:37,549
Waterford, Connecticut, was that town
I couldn't think of.

1008
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:40,110
But I knew I'd remember that voice.

1009
01:17:40,422 --> 01:17:44,586
His face... You've changed.
But it's the same man.

1010
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:48,086
You remember that $5,000 reward, though,
don't you, Judge?

1011
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:51,428
Judge. This is impossible.
You're getting confused.

1012
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:54,864
He sounds to me as though
he knows exactly what he's saying.

1013
01:17:54,936 --> 01:17:57,837
This is idiotic!
Screwball, crackbrained lunacy!

1014
01:17:57,906 --> 01:18:01,364
And that's just the kind of a witness
the judge is going to make, too, Steve.

1015
01:18:01,443 --> 01:18:03,240
The police have that specimen
of hair and flesh

1016
01:18:03,311 --> 01:18:05,905
found under Mrs. Grant's fingernails.

1017
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:09,283
I think we'd better get in touch with Davis.

1018
01:18:09,551 --> 01:18:11,212
No phone, Allison.

1019
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:26,359
Julie pegged you right off.
But me, still wet behind the ears McCleary.

1020
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:29,328
I went for the sleigh ride.

1021
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:35,409
I practically built the pedestal for Chapman.
The great newspaperman. The great guy.

1022
01:18:36,778 --> 01:18:41,545
There ought to be a special Pulitzer Prize
for the world's biggest sucker, McCleary.

1023
01:18:41,616 --> 01:18:44,141
Just another one of your stupid slobs!

1024
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:45,948
Things happen, Steve,
and then there's just no end.

1025
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:47,921
Killing my wife was an accident.

1026
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:51,823
And Charlie. Charlie Barnes,
who never hurt a fly in his life.

1027
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:54,057
A washed-up drunken rummy
who had nothing to live for

1028
01:18:54,129 --> 01:18:55,790
against a career
that was just reaching its prime.

1029
01:18:55,864 --> 01:18:59,322
- It wasn't an even exchange.
- You've got a great career ahead of you now.

1030
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:02,302
That's all down the drain.
I gotta to make different plans now.

1031
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:04,736
You should have started running
when you got my wire, sucker!

1032
01:19:04,806 --> 01:19:06,501
I gambled.
The stakes are big enough, you don't run

1033
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:10,443
unless there's nothing else left to do.
Don't try it, kid.

1034
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:30,190
Steve!

1035
01:19:50,986 --> 01:19:53,011
We're just too close, kid.

1036
01:19:57,292 --> 01:20:02,059
I figured I'd find you birds here.
Still playing me for a pushover, aren't you?

1037
01:20:04,032 --> 01:20:06,227
Steve, you remember how I told you

1038
01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:09,464
that someday you'd run into
a really great story?

1039
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:11,736
Well, this one ought to do it, huh?

1040
01:20:12,474 --> 01:20:14,374
Yeah, this one will do.

1041
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:16,603
I'll give you the lead on it.

1042
01:20:17,846 --> 01:20:18,972
"The elusive Lonely Heart Killer,

1043
01:20:19,047 --> 01:20:20,708

1045
01:20:25,387 --> 01:20:27,321

01:20:31,259 --> 01:20:32,920

01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:35,827
"Managing Editor of the <i>New York Express."</i>

1049
01:20:37,766 --> 01:20:42,601
- Write it up big, kid. It'll sell a lot of papers.
- All right, drop it, Chapman.
