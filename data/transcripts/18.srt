1
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:12,674
<i>It was early dawn
on the day before Christmas.</i>

2
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,884
<i>The city was still asleep.</i>

3
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,119
<i>That is, most of the
city was still asleep.</i>

4
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:21,558
<i>Others were already up
and about their business.</i>

5
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,352
<i>The story you're about to see is true.</i>

6
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,438
<i>I know, it happened to me.</i>

7
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,441
<i>I can't tell you where
or when it happened.</i>

8
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,818
<i>There are still people around,</i>

9
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,736
<i>people who never forget,</i>

10
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,989
<i>and I'd like to keep on living.</i>

11
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:40,142
<i>My name? Let's just say it's Casey Martin.</i>

12
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,278
- What's the matter?

13
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,012
- Out.

14
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,946
I'll drive him around till he wakes up.

15
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:38,325
See you tonight at Louie's place.

16
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:06,204
<i>I didn't know it yet,</i>

17
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:08,164
<i>but this was going to be my big day,</i>

18
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:11,459
<i>my big opportunity; my Christmas present.</i>

19
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:15,112
<i>December 24th, a day I'll never forget.</i>

20
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,042
Take it easy, will ya Jack?

21
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,672
- Excuse me, miss.

22
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,031
- Joe, help him out.

23
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,741
How many times I gotta tell you, Casey?

24
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,159
You don't start fights in here.

25
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,661
- Oh, shut up, Louie.

26
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:47,870
- Shut up, he said.

27
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:50,498
Try to bust the joint up
and tells me to shut up.

28
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:53,775
Come on, come on. Alright.

29
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,774
- Merry Christmas.

30
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,008
- What's merry about it?

31
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:25,993
- You know, the trouble with you

32
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:28,202
is you know too much about psychiatry.

33
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,829
- You have to!

34
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,606
Otherwise you develop little
mental blocks and things.

35
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,904
Here comes a couple of live ones.

36
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,292
- What is it, what do you want?

37
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,021
What do you want?

38
00:04:54,045 --> 00:04:55,104
- You.

39
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,064
Why?

40
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:57,714
- Tell you all about it, come on.

41
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:04,697
- Land of the free!

42
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,056
- Too free for some of us.

43
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:27,346
<i>When the boys from</i>

44
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,721
<i>the Treasury Department pick you up,</i>

45
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,141
<i>believe me, it's no
ordinary two bit pinch.</i>

46
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,061
<i>When the government steps
in, you're in trouble.</i>

47
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:35,919
<i>Real trouble.</i>

48
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,606
<i>I had that all gone feeling</i>

49
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,608
<i>right in the middle of my stomach.</i>

50
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,151
<i>The feeling that the roof had caved in</i>

51
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,886
<i>and there wasn't much use
of trying to dig my way out.</i>

52
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,027
What is this?

53
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,864
- You're Casey Martin?
- That's right.

54
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,844
- How much time have
you served Mr. Martin?

55
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,119
- Nine years, why?

56
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,037
- Sit down.

57
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,084
I asked you to sit down, Mr. Martin.

58
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,195
Leavenworth: three years, three months.

59
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,221
Back again two years, six months.

60
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,325
Atlanta, four years.

61
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,661
Now you're out two weeks
and you're in trouble again.

62
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:34,704
- What do you mean?

63
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:35,997
- Well, a four time loser can spend

64
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,999
the rest of his life
in prison, Mr. Martin.

65
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,357
- What are you driving at?

66
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:46,632
So?

67
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,925
- That your brand?

68
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,260
- I mix 'em up.

69
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,428
- Oh?

70
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:51,721
-Why?

71
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:52,805
- We found this package

72
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,224
at the spot where a truck was hijacked.

73
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,267
- Well?

74
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,227
- We found your
fingerprints on the package.

75
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,294
- That's a lie.

76
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:03,381
- Send in Mr. Sears.

77
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:17,187
Do you recognize this man Mr. Sears?

78
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:19,940
Take off your hat.

79
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,214
- He's one of them.

80
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,657
- Thank you, you can go.

81
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:35,956
- Well, that's it Mr. Martin.

82
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,250
What do you intend doing about it?

83
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,545
- What can I do?

84
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,548
- After a man reaches a certain age,

85
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,609
there's only one way he can

86
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,218
break loose from the underworld.

87
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:51,948
He's got to blast himself
loose with a big bang.

88
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,992
Make a big move, burn all his bridges;

89
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,977
turn his life upside down if necessary.

90
00:07:59,187 --> 00:07:59,998
- What do you mean?

91
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:01,415
We want you to work with us.

92
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:03,626
- You've been in trouble all your life.

93
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,545
We're offering you a
chance to break clean.

94
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,089
- What are you talking about?

95
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:10,991
- We're giving you an opportunity
to get yourself killed.

96
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,513
Look, you know the mobs, how they operate.

97
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:19,058
One strong, ruthless man can
tie a syndicate together.

98
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:21,143
He pushes the buttons
and pulls the strings

99
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,062
and all over the nation,

100
00:08:22,086 --> 00:08:24,355
his vicious rackets are set in motion.

101
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,422
He's a dictator.

102
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,734
We are after one of those dictators.

103
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,319
We want him bad.

104
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,177
- Who?

105
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,263
- Dutch Becker.

106
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:36,516
- Good luck.

107
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:40,270
Put the finger on
him and you're a free man.

108
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:42,832
- You're kidding.

109
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,291
-Am I?

110
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,483
- Listen mister,

111
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,962
I spent two extra years in stir

112
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,089
because I wouldn't tell
him who my partner was.

113
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,132
I was brought up that way.

114
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,615
I don't intend to change now.

115
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,303
- Look, you know Dutch
Becker as well as I do.

116
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,473
He has no conscience, he has no soul.

117
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,474
It makes no difference to him

118
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,019
if he destroys an individual
or a family or a nation.

119
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,396
And enough men like Becker
could destroy a nation.

120
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,314
- You picked me up on a meatball charge.

121
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,524
Why don't you pick him up?

122
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,234
- Because he is too smart.

123
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,277
We can't prove a thing, yet.

124
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,820
His lawyers would have
him out in 10 minutes.

125
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,071
- That's your problem.

126
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,406
- Yes, and that's a big one.

127
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,199
Nine states big.

128
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,244
We know that Becker is operating
in at least nine states.

129
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:23,497
California, Oregon, New York, New Jersey,

130
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:27,043
Illinois, Minnesota,
Missouri, Arizona, and Nevada.

131
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,504
He gets his cut out of
everything rotten that's sold.

132
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,362
We want him.

133
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:33,948
Let me show you something.

134
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,872
Here's a girl, 17.

135
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,167
Dead before she even started to live.

136
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,588
Sixteen, twenty.

137
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,442
There's a girl, nineteen.

138
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,943
They found her in a trunk.

139
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,153
She wanted to go home to her family,

140
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,012
but the boys couldn't see it her way.

141
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,616
The hospitals, jails, asylums, and morgues

142
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,992
are full of human beings
who were destroyed

143
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,309
by men like Dutch Becker.

144
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,021
- You seen your sister lately?

145
00:10:06,648 --> 00:10:08,542
- Lucille? No, Why?

146
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:09,919
- Just wondered.

147
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,546
- A man ought to keep in
closer touch with his family.

148
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,465
- I haven't been around, remember?

149
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,698
Yeah, we know.

150
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,576
- You can go now, Casey.

151
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:25,684
Think it over: the rest of your
life in jail is a long time.

152
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,727
Let us know what to decide,

153
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,479
we'll give you four hours.

154
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:29,688
- You're getting a break, Casey.

155
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,190
Don't throw it away.

156
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:33,049
- Call getting myself killed a break?

157
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,696
Drop over and
see your sister, Casey.

158
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,097
She won't be there tomorrow.

159
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,368
-Why?

160
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,060
- Just drop over and see her.

161
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,771
She might help you make up your mind.

162
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:59,510
<i>It isn't often
anyone gets a break like that.</i>

163
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,327
<i>I was offered a clean bill of health,</i>

164
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,806
<i>my freedom, a new start.</i>

165
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,101
<i>All I had to do was put
the finger on Dutch Becker.</i>

166
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,394
<i>I'd been around long enough to know</i>

167
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,896
<i>all there is to know about Dutch Becker.</i>

168
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,150
<i>He was one of the biggest
gamblers in the country.</i>

169
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:17,093
<i>He was the kingpin in a
nationwide illegal alcohol ring.</i>

170
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,364
<i>He employed beautiful girls as escorts,</i>

171
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,324
<i>hostesses, shills, and bee girls</i>

172
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,726
<i>in his clubs and gambling houses.</i>

173
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,663
<i>If they crossed him,</i>

174
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:29,415
<i>they weren't very pretty to
look at when he paid them,</i>

175
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:30,440
<i>and he always did.</i>

176
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,277
<i>This was the man they
wanted me to double cross.</i>

177
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,798
<i>I hadn't seen Lucille for a long time,</i>

178
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,634
<i>but I remember that she loved the bottle.</i>

179
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,493
<i>She loved the bottle more than life.</i>

180
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:44,871
<i>Maybe she was on it again.</i>

181
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,223
- Hi honey.

182
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,059
- Casey?

183
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,061
- Yeah.

184
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,748
- Are you really Casey?

185
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,666
- Yeah, I'm Casey.

186
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,566
- Oh!

187
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,297
I'm so glad to see ya.

188
00:12:18,321 --> 00:12:19,322
I'm so glad!

189
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,158
- Gee Junie, you've grown up.

190
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:24,244
Hows your mommy?

191
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,722
- I think she's sleeping.

192
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,515
She's sick, Casey.

193
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,059
I've been trying to help her, but,

194
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,518
I'm scared Casey.

195
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,812
- All right, sweetheart.

196
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,171
All right, okay.

197
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:43,972
- Junie,

198
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,474
Junie,

199
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,853
that you, Junie?

200
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,317
Junie,

201
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:58,987
Junie.

202
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,454
Casey?

203
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,332
Casey.

204
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:14,270
Don't let him take me away, Casey.

205
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,004
Don't let him take me away.

206
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,214
- You stupid fool.

207
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,858
- You all right, Mommy?

208
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,005
- Get that kid outta here!
- Mommy!

209
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:41,965
- Get out of here!
- Mommy!

210
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:45,283
- Get out, get out!
- Lucille, stop!

211
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,165
- My baby, my little baby.

212
00:13:58,629 --> 00:13:59,773
- But she wants me, Casey.

213
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,609
-All right, sweetheart. Come here.

214
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,320
Have you got a phone book?

215
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,863
- In the hall.

216
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:09,116
-Alright, now you look
up a Dr. Charles Joyce

217
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,266
on East Fourth Street.

218
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,412
Then you call him up

219
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:15,289
and you tell him your uncle Casey Martin

220
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,874
wants him to come over here right away.

221
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:17,732
Can you do that?

222
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,984
Okay, sweetheart. Go on.

223
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,562
How long you been on this?

224
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:41,148
- I don't know, I don't know.

225
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,858
You gotta help me.

226
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,109
I hurt so bad.

227
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,904
Get me a drink, Casey. Please!

228
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,471
- No, I won't get you nothing.

229
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,202
- Listen, they say I'm crazy.

230
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,704
They're gonna take Junie away from me.

231
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,688
I'm not crazy, I'm not!

232
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,919
- What happened to you?

233
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,463
- Oh don't, Casey. Please!

234
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,091
- Why are you doing this to yourself?

235
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:07,949
Why?

236
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,832
You know Dutch Becker?

237
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,174
- That's funny. That's very funny!

238
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,555
- Do you know him?

239
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,017
- I used to be the prettiest
girl ever worked for Dutch.

240
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:38,539
You hear that Casey?

241
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:41,441
I used to be the prettiest
girl ever worked for Dutch.

242
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,194
I used to be proud.

243
00:15:48,823 --> 00:15:50,241
Now I got no pride.

244
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:54,454
All the looks, nothing.

245
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,560
- What about your little girl?

246
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,127
You've got her, what about her?

247
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,565
- Don't, don't. Can't you
see it's killing me, Casey?

248
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:05,840
Can't you see it?

249
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,576
- I can't, I can't, I can't!

250
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,411
- Lucille!

251
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:18,853
- I can't, I can't!
- Lucille!

252
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,099
- Burns speaking.

253
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,978
Yeah, put him on.

254
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,023
Casey.

255
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:06,651
Good.

256
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,444
What's that?

257
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:11,757
Okay, Casey.

258
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,407
We'll let your doctor handle it.

259
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,786
Yeah, I know.

260
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:21,290
Yeah, how's 10 in the morning?

261
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,294
Fine, see you then.

262
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,048
We've got our man.

263
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,770
- Hi Casey.

264
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,873
- Hi.

265
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,023
- What am I, an orphan?

266
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,734
- Hi Gladys.

267
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,279
I got a gland for you.

268
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,008
- Oh, that's good. That's good.

269
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,885
- Good? Is that all you can say?

270
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,471
- What do you want me to do, kiss you?

271
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,621
- Hey, you loaded?

272
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,809
- You might be able to say that.

273
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,102
- What are you folks having?

274
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:06,019
Gladys?

275
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:06,854
- Scotch over.

276
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:07,920
- Lefty?
- No thanks.

277
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,016
- You nuts or something,
getting loaded today?

278
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,662
- Today is the day to get loaded, Lefty.

279
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,581
Today is definitely the day.

280
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:26,873
- What are you talking about?

281
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,333
- It's a big day.

282
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,567
It's a day to celebrate.

283
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,629
- You off your rocker?

284
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,487
- You all right?

285
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,592
I'm alright.

286
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:37,634
- Look, Case,

287
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,387
it's a big load coming through tonight.

288
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,347
Go on home, take a bath,

289
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:44,123
sober up and we'll talk.
- Forget it, we're through.

290
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,893
- What?
- I said, we're through.

291
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:47,752
-Why?

292
00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:52,232
- Take a long trip, Lefty.

293
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,341
Just take a long trip.

294
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,319
- Talk sense, will ya Case?

295
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,737
Talk sense.

296
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,031
I got a tip
and that's a good one.

297
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:01,366
Just take a long trip.

298
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,368
You on the level?

299
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,495
- There's one of two
things that you can do.

300
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,520
You can get outta here,

301
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:07,664
or you can shut up and have a drink.

302
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,898
Which one? I don't care.

303
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:12,836
- You coming with me?
- No.

304
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,504
- What?
- I said no.

305
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,155
- Okay, okay.

306
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,259
Where do I get in touch with you?

307
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:19,551
Don't.

308
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,887
- What?
- I said, don't.

309
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:22,912
- All right.

310
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,682
- Coming with me, Gladys?

311
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,874
- I'll buy you a drink.

312
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,335
- You're buying, I'm staying.

313
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,857
- You wouldn't be trying to
pull a cross with you, Case?

314
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,217
- Did you ever know me
to double cross anybody?

315
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,136
I want my money.

316
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,617
Merry Christmas.

317
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,744
- Merry Christmas Casey.

318
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:06,997
- Ah, pour yourself one.

319
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,832
- Thanks.

320
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,044
Happy holiday, folks.

321
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:18,592
- This is nice.

322
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,344
- Yeah.

323
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,031
- What's the matter with you tonight?

324
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,265
Something bothering you?

325
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,018
- Fella told me something today.

326
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,706
He said if I wanted to get any place,

327
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,106
I'd have to make a big move.

328
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,501
Burn my bridges behind me,

329
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:37,027
turn my life upside down.

330
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,007
That's what I'm gonna do.

331
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:42,634
- How?

332
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,118
- You know Dutch Becker?

333
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,167
How well do you know him?

334
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:56,606
- Why?
- Wanna meet him.

335
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,233
- Why do you wanna meet him?

336
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,402
- Well, he knows how to make money.

337
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,552
I want some of it.

338
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,847
- I don't like that kind of money, Casey.

339
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,869
- It'll spend.

340
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:09,769
- You spend it.

341
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,541
Oh, forget Dutch, Casey.

342
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:15,649
You don't need him.

343
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,360
- Forget I talked to you.

344
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,601
- Hi, handsome.

345
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:33,459
- Hi Mother.

346
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:35,562
- Mother?

347
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,023
- Come on, beat it will ya?

348
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:39,399
- You've got a lot of nerve.

349
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,151
- Yeah, I know.

350
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:42,468
Here, Merry Christmas.

351
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,224
- Happy New Year.

352
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:15,393
- You like music, don't you?

353
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,562
- Yeah, I like it.

354
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,671
- I like you.

355
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,470
You win, Casey.

356
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,617
- When do I meet him?

357
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:31,767
- Anytime you say.

358
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:47,760
I'll call you later.

359
00:22:47,784 --> 00:22:49,785
- Where you going?
- Out.

360
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,677
- Well, what do you think?

361
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:31,952
- I think he'll show.

362
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,681
- I give him 15 more minutes

363
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,373
and then I'll put out a pickup on him.

364
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,068
Hello, Casey.
- Hi.

365
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,969
- You know Johnny Cooper, Fred Amory.

366
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:53,533
Dick Sullivan, Jim Rogers, Ted Wheelock,

367
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,726
Al Chance, Frank Sallow, Bud Anderson.

368
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,707
I've seen you before.

369
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,483
- Could be you'll see more of me.

370
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:08,798
- Did you ever meet Dutch?

371
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,008
- No.

372
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:11,927
- Well, he's shrewd and he's tough.

373
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,595
Make no mistake about that.

374
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,805
One bad move and it may be your last.

375
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:16,622
- Yeah.

376
00:24:16,664 --> 00:24:18,141
- Came from the same
neighborhood, didn't you?

377
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,684
- Yeah, but I don't know him.

378
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,728
- You have an important asset.

379
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,754
Loyalty to your friends, they trust you.

380
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:28,194
- So what do I do?

381
00:24:28,218 --> 00:24:29,903
- Can you fix a meet with him?

382
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:30,820
- I think so.

383
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:31,739
- How?

384
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:33,990
- You know a girl named Gladys Baker?

385
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,909
- Well, I know she's made
a few contacts for you.

386
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,118
- Well, she doesn't know it yet,

387
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,602
but she fixes me with Dutch.

388
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:42,940
Then you'll kill all your
charges against her, right?

389
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,503
- Right.

390
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,505
- Better build it up
soft and slow, Martin.

391
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,006
Get his confidence.

392
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:52,550
- Listen, Mr. Sullivan, that right?

393
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,386
- That's right.

394
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,327
- Okay, Mr. Sullivan, I took this job.

395
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,430
When I take a job, I do it right.

396
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,724
- You sure you could handle it?

397
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,417
- Well, who can be sure of anything?

398
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,481
What do you want me to get him on?

399
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,899
- That's up to you.

400
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:10,402
It's wide open, take your choice.

401
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,696
Just be sure we can make it stick.

402
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,448
Oh, and don't get any ideas
about running out on us.

403
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,200
We'll be watching you every minute.

404
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,058
- Yeah.

405
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,854
- All right, you're on your own, Casey.

406
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,374
Good luck.

407
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:27,002
<i>Well there it
was, laid right in my lap.</i>

408
00:25:27,026 --> 00:25:29,611
<i>I come out clean or I come out dead.</i>

409
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:34,259
<i>The Treasury Department and
the police were on my side.</i>

410
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:36,136
<i>Against me, there was a big time hoodlum</i>

411
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,179
<i>by the name of Dutch Becker,</i>

412
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,664
<i>and the entire underworld
from coast to coast.</i>

413
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,226
<i>There wasn't a gambler alive</i>

414
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,877
<i>who'd make book with those odds.</i>

415
00:25:58,182 --> 00:25:59,475
- Hello?

416
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,827
<i>Gladys?</i>

417
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,454
- Yeah.
<i>- Casey.</i>

418
00:26:02,478 --> 00:26:06,750
- Oh! Oh, am I glad to hear from you.

419
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:09,252
I thought you might've
changed your mind about me.

420
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,486
- When can I meet Dutch?

421
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,131
- Why don't you forget him?

422
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,948
I still don't like it.

423
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,116
- When can I meet him?

424
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,512
- Well, he has lunch every day

425
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:22,140
at his Torch Club down on East 12th.

426
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,933
- Good, now you meet me there at 12:30

427
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,727
<i>and you'll make like
you got a date with me.</i>

428
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:26,561
- But,

429
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,503
<i>- Yeah, 12:30.</i>

430
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,733
- That stuff will kill you, Dutch.

431
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,735
- Uh-uh, keep me healthy.

432
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:16,986
Get my friend a drink.

433
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,656
- Thanks, scotch over rocks.

434
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,865
- Want something to eat?

435
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,534
- No, I've got a date.

436
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:24,494
Fella who grew up down
here, maybe you know him.

437
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:25,371
- Who's that?

438
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:27,122
- His name's Casey Martin.

439
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,498
- Yeah, I heard of him.

440
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,375
You know him, Lou?

441
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:31,960
- Yeah.

442
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:35,070
I saw him every day for
four years in Atlanta.

443
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,882
I don't like him.

444
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,551
You don't like nobody.

445
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:43,555
- Nobody, exceptin' you Dutch.

446
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:44,621
- Yeah, exceptin' me.

447
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,183
You tell me that this
Martin boy's pretty smart,

448
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,018
knows how to keep his mouth shut?

449
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,395
I'd like to meet him, all right?

450
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:51,211
- Okay.

451
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:55,132
Dutch, I like him.

452
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,635
Don't ever tell him
anything about me, please?

453
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,263
- I don't know what you're talking about.

454
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:03,741
- Thanks.
- Swiss cheese on rye

455
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:04,577
and a glass of milk.

456
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:06,077
- Coming up.
- Bring him over.

457
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:06,935
- I will.

458
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:27,390
- Lonesome?

459
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,516
- Hi.

460
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,209
Make it good, he's here.

461
00:28:46,934 --> 00:28:48,101
- Where is he?

462
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,855
- Table right behind
you, over by the wall.

463
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:06,286
We're lucky, he wants to meet you.

464
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,081
- Nice company he keeps.

465
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,185
Had enough?

466
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:15,313
- Mm-hm.

467
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:16,755
- Okay, let's go.

468
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:29,977
- Dutch?

469
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,437
This is Casey. Martin.

470
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,415
Casey, Mr. Becker.

471
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:35,023
- Hi.
- Sit down.

472
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,344
You know Lou.

473
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,971
- I know him.

474
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:50,014
<i>- Yeah, we were memes.</i>

475
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,081
One with big shot.

476
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,978
- You were a pretty hot kid
around this neighborhood,

477
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:56,128
a couple of years back.

478
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,189
- I got along.

479
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,274
- What are you doing now?

480
00:29:59,298 --> 00:30:00,132
- I get along.

481
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,343
- You got a good mouth, keep it closed.

482
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,823
- Gladys said you wanted to see me.

483
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:07,658
- She did?

484
00:30:07,682 --> 00:30:09,516
- Yeah, why?

485
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,895
- Well, maybe just to prove
that I'm not antisocial.

486
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,023
- Maybe I am. C'mon.

487
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:20,110
- I like you up to now.

488
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,547
Don't spoil it.

489
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:23,548
- You know Mister, for a long time

490
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,967
people were telling me
what to say and what to do.

491
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,409
Now I'm my own boss.

492
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:31,431
- Jack,

493
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:32,849
couple of drinks for my friends.

494
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,249
- Not right now, thank you.

495
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:38,003
Nice meeting you.

496
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,172
C'mon honey.

497
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:09,803
- Hiya Candy.

498
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,828
- Get your wet paws off me.

499
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,789
- You tramp.

500
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,476
You're a no good tramp.

501
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,211
- So? Go sit down.

502
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:24,150
- It's a very beautiful flower.

503
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:25,967
- Yeah, beautiful.

504
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,263
- Carlos, you got no soul.

505
00:31:31,181 --> 00:31:32,265
Why is she here?

506
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,870
- Because she's going south
with the take, that's why.

507
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,080
- You're a stinking liar.

508
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:39,040
- Temper, temper.

509
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:39,917
How do you know?

510
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:40,982
- Two reasons.

511
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:47,673
Where else you get this kind of dough?

512
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,550
- So I saved it, you big ape.

513
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,718
- Please.

514
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:51,719
And?

515
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,930
- And we got a beef from a customer.

516
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,080
Claims he was rolled.

517
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,142
Oh?

518
00:31:57,166 --> 00:31:58,935
- Dutch, you know me better than that.

519
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,645
Do I?

520
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,438
- Well, don't you?

521
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,524
- I'm not sure, Candy,
I'm not sure at all.

522
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:05,900
When I'm not sure I worry,

523
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,819
and I don't like to worry.

524
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,487
Lou.

525
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:10,321
- Yes?

526
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,280
- Where's she working?

527
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,116
- The Topper.

528
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,282
- Get another girl over there.

529
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,118
- But Dutch?

530
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:16,327
- And take her off the
payroll for a while.

531
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,686
- Dutch, you can't do this.

532
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,415
- You better muss her face up a little bit

533
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,750
so she can't work any place.

534
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,335
- No, Dutch.

535
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:27,171
Dutch, I didn't cheat
you, honest I didn't.

536
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,756
You gotta believe me.

537
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,050
- Sure, I believe you. Almost.

538
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,802
Maybe it's a good thing.

539
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,053
Maybe if you go hungry for a while,

540
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:37,098
you'll remember that
honesty's the best policy.

541
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:37,914
Lou?

542
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,752
- Dirty rotten.

543
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:48,842
- It's too bad.

544
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,029
It's too bad.

545
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,513
People got to get greedy.

546
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,558
Just got to get greedy.

547
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,439
Any other business today?

548
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:05,567
Carlos has got a surprise for you.

549
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,386
- This is Mary Smith, Dutch.

550
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,745
- Maw Smith, huh?

551
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,475
There's so many of you.

552
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,518
- That's really my name, Mr. Becker.

553
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,811
- Yeah, sure.

554
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,354
Where are you from Mary?

555
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,172
- Akron. That's in Ohio.

556
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:29,132
- Yeah, I know.

557
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,611
How old are you?

558
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:32,469
- Twenty one.

559
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,265
- That's good.

560
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,185
That's good.

561
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,126
Well, you're a very beautiful girl, Mary.

562
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,360
- Thank you. Mr. Becker.

563
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,421
- Carlos?

564
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,506
- Yeah Dutch?

565
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,965
- Show her the ropes.

566
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,635
Put her on over at The Topper.

567
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:56,761
Get her some new clothes

568
00:33:56,785 --> 00:34:01,349
and surely we can find a better
name than Mary Smith, huh?

569
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:02,892
- Thank you, Mr. Becker.

570
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,477
Thank you very much.

571
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:05,710
- It's a pleasure, Maw.

572
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,898
Remember this, I only ask two things:

573
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:10,316
Honesty and loyalty.

574
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:13,218
I must have loyalty, hmm?

575
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,146
- What's the deal, Casey?

576
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:27,607
- What do you mean?

577
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,127
- You're nervous, nervous as a cat.

578
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,736
- So, I don't sleep good nights.

579
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,216
- Now, when you asked me
to have a drink with you,

580
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,366
I was pretty happy.

581
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,286
Now, I don't know.

582
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,207
All my life, I've had dreams.

583
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:46,668
Not big ones,

584
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,565
just my share of the little things.

585
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,967
Have someone like me, really like me.

586
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:57,679
Maybe even respect me.

587
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,685
Someone I could take care of, love,

588
00:35:06,396 --> 00:35:08,207
I know I'm no bargain,

589
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,042
I've been around plenty.

590
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,860
I don't feel sorry for myself.

591
00:35:14,738 --> 00:35:16,132
Only sometimes I get the feeling

592
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:17,490
there isn't any more time.

593
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:21,661
There isn't gonna be any tomorrow.

594
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:26,875
Be nice to me, Casey.

595
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:30,879
Please.

596
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:49,898
- Here.

597
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,445
You know, we're two of a kind.

598
00:35:57,906 --> 00:36:00,325
You never got a break and
I never asked for one.

599
00:36:02,619 --> 00:36:03,620
So here's to us.

600
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,666
Win, lose, or draw, here's to us.

601
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:14,881
- You mean it?

602
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,303
- Well, I don't know very
much about being nice,

603
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:23,932
but for you, I'll try.

604
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:38,822
- Casey.

605
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:42,385
- World might end for both of us

606
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:44,035
tonight, tomorrow, or next week.

607
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:50,458
You gotta remember that.

608
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,145
- We could go away, Casey.

609
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,379
Forget Dutch.

610
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:58,192
We'll go to another town and start living.

611
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,135
- First thing you gotta learn is this:

612
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,346
win, lose or draw, I call the play.

613
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:13,565
- Okay Casey, you call the play.

614
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,605
- I met Dutch, seemed to like me.

615
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:18,689
- Make him love you.

616
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,173
Live it up, spend some money.

617
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,258
- You got any money?

618
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,887
- Interesting magazine, look it over.

619
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,265
- How's Lucille?

620
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:33,019
- She's rough. She wants to see you.

621
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:34,813
- Okay.

622
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,973
- I like a man who reads, shows he thinks.

623
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:55,267
I like a man who thinks.

624
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,268
- Hi Dutch.

625
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,126
- Small world.

626
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:01,273
Meet Carlos Armor, Big Joe Walters.

627
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,858
- Hi.
- Can we give you a lift?

628
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,611
- No thank you, I feel like walking.

629
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:06,469
- That's good.

630
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,890
You guys ought gonna walk more.

631
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,702
I like you.

632
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:16,705
Maybe we do business, maybe
you come to work for me.

633
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:17,564
- Maybe.

634
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,817
- Come around and see me, we'll talk.

635
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,883
<i>He was so right.</i>

636
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,577
<i>I'd be down to see him soon, real soon.</i>

637
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,038
<i>I was gonna stick closer
to him than his breath,</i>

638
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,749
<i>but first I had to see Lucille.</i>

639
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:57,478
Lucille?

640
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,064
Lucille.

641
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,502
- Hi, Casey.

642
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:04,360
- How ya doing?

643
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:07,047
- You don't know.

644
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,072
You don't know.

645
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,343
- Yes I do.

646
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,220
- No, you don't know.

647
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,329
You can't know.

648
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,876
They're giving it to me
all at once, kill or cure.

649
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,254
I don't know yet which way it's going.

650
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,342
- You're gonna be all right.

651
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,197
- How's Junie?

652
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:33,222
- Oh, she's fine. She's just fine.

653
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,368
- I'm scared, Casey.

654
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,226
I'm scared.

655
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:39,646
It's hell.

656
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,732
There's no hell like it.

657
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,734
None like it.

658
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,571
- You're gonna be all
right, I promise you.

659
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,468
Honey, I've got to go.

660
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:54,011
The nurse said I could just stay

661
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:55,286
long enough to say hello.

662
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:02,061
- Is there room in the
world for people like us?

663
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:02,919
Is there?

664
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,756
- There's plenty of room
for all of us, Lucille.

665
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,925
Almost all of us.

666
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,931
- If I get well, can we be together more?

667
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:17,475
I need someone.

668
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,104
I'm not strong, Casey.

669
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,690
I need someone to help me.

670
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:30,113
- I'm gonna give you
all the help you need.

671
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,902
<i>Maybe Dutch
wasn't sure of me yet.</i>

672
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,345
<i>Maybe Carlos and Big Joe
talked him out of it.</i>

673
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,449
<i>Anyway, he didn't repeat
his offer of a job,</i>

674
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,076
<i>but I built it slow and easy,</i>

675
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,912
<i>just like the government boys told me to.</i>

676
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,604
<i>I took my time and I waited.</i>

677
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:06,333
<i>I got to know Dutch and his mob,</i>

678
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,860
<i>and the better I knew them,
the more I hated them.</i>

679
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:13,007
<i>I'd lived my whole life with hoods.</i>

680
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:15,074
<i>One thing they respect is guts,</i>

681
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,453
<i>so I was going to give
it to them in spades.</i>

682
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:23,082
- You're two people, aren't you, Casey?

683
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,477
- Who isn't?

684
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:26,753
- Yeah, who isn't?

685
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:31,358
Well, they're all here tonight.

686
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,300
The worst of them.

687
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:34,761
Nice company we're keeping.

688
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:39,241
- Well, you don't go to
church to make a fast buck.

689
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,368
Where'd you get that halo all of a sudden?

690
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,746
- Halo, me?

691
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:44,896
Oh, it's pretty funny.

692
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,399
Oh, we're Penny Annie
alongside this bunch.

693
00:42:49,317 --> 00:42:50,860
- You with me or against me?

694
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,339
Sorry Casey,
I guess I'm just tired.

695
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,698
- Want me to take you home?

696
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:58,743
I go when you go.

697
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,836
- Pataruski yet.

698
00:43:10,338 --> 00:43:12,799
- There's a very interesting young man.

699
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:16,361
He's gonna be a very useful young man.

700
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,197
- What do you know about him, Dutch?

701
00:43:17,221 --> 00:43:19,281
Outside of Gladys brought him down here.

702
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,616
- He's all right.

703
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,910
I had him screened, like they say.

704
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:25,853
He's all right, could use him.

705
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,083
Lou?

706
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:30,709
- Yeah, yeah Dutch?

707
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:31,567
- Bring him over.

708
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:47,208
- Take your hands off me.

709
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,647
- Boss wants to see you.

710
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:53,172
- Tell him I'll be right over.

711
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,802
- Boss wants to see you, now.

712
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:06,162
- Casey!
- I told you

713
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:07,371
to keep your hands off me.

714
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:08,729
- Break it up, break it up!

715
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:10,731
Put it away, Lou.

716
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:14,712
Go on home, Lou.

717
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:16,362
I'll talk to you later.

718
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,364
- I said, go home Lou.

719
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,953
All right, back to your party.

720
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:25,830
Right now!

721
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:35,566
You, you shouldn't cause
trouble Mr. Martin.

722
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,384
- You tell that moron to
keep his hands off me.

723
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,262
- I don't take orders, I give them.

724
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,241
Come on, we'll talk.

725
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,285
Casey, you've had a lot to drink.

726
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:48,245
Let's go home, we'll talk tomorrow.

727
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:50,080
- We'll talk now.

728
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,647
You come along, you can listen.

729
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:54,442
Please.

730
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:13,502
Sit down, Gladys.

731
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,535
What are you trying to prove,

732
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,245
that you're tough?

733
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,229
- I'm tough enough.

734
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,832
- Always remember one thing, Casey;

735
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,067
there's somebody tougher than you.

736
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:38,152
- Prove it.

737
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,381
-Hmm.

738
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,717
Well, maybe you're the exception.

739
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:46,386
- You know I could do you a lot of good.

740
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,721
You need me.

741
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,432
Maybe you don't like me, but you need me.

742
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,267
- But I do like you.

743
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:55,896
But what makes you think I need you?

744
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,231
- You're a big man, Dutch.

745
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:59,632
You need a big man around you, strong man.

746
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:01,592
You need me.

747
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:04,321
- Maybe you make sense.

748
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:05,656
Drink your drink.

749
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,491
- Don't you think you've
had enough tonight?

750
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:08,432
- I can handle it.

751
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:12,955
There isn't much I
can't handle, huh Dutch?

752
00:46:12,979 --> 00:46:14,355
- Well, that's what you say.

753
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,692
- You got a big lip.

754
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,088
Carlos, I
drive you nuts, don't I?

755
00:46:21,112 --> 00:46:22,547
You can't figure me.

756
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:26,218
And you, Big Joe.

757
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:27,803
You don't get me, do you?

758
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:28,744
- I don't want to.

759
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,539
- Keep talking, loud mouth.

760
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:35,001
- Big!

761
00:46:38,921 --> 00:46:40,399
Spirit, I like.

762
00:46:40,423 --> 00:46:41,757
Trouble, I don't like.

763
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:43,820
If you're gonna work for me,

764
00:46:43,844 --> 00:46:45,511
there's one thing you gotta learn.

765
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:48,448
There's no percentage in us
fighting among ourselves.

766
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,724
No percentage at all.

767
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,768
I'm a very mild man, Casey.

768
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:57,982
Violence, I don't like,
unless it's necessary.

769
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,235
You think you can remember that?

770
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:03,714
- I'll try.

771
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:04,572
- Good.

772
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,325
Meet me here tomorrow night.

773
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:11,746
Now, go along home and
get yourself a good sleep.

774
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:20,004
See you tomorrow.

775
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:43,194
- Someday I'm gonna kill that guy.

776
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,882
- You're not gonna kill anybody,

777
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:48,074
unless I tell you to.

778
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:50,260
Big, call a cab.

779
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,160
It's getting late.

780
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:55,831
- Hand me the phone, will you?

781
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:04,066
<i>- Burns?</i>
- Yo.

782
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,049
- Rogers.

783
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:07,569
Casey just left, do I
tail him or stay here?

784
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:10,072
<i>Stay with him. He's alone?</i>

785
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:11,972
<i>No, Gladys Baker's with him.</i>

786
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:26,463
<i>Stick right with him,</i>

787
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:28,298
<i>check back in an hour.</i>

788
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:29,549
<i>They go home?</i>

789
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,051
- Yeah, I think so.

790
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,511
<i>Okay.</i>

791
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:33,369
- Right.

792
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:16,931
<i>The next morning,</i>

793
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:19,224
<i>I had another meet with the treasury men.</i>

794
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:20,976
<i>The place was the Blue Gull Kitchen</i>

795
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,251
<i>over on East 10th Street.</i>

796
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,188
<i>So far I was out in front,</i>

797
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,107
<i>but I had a feeling that
something was wrong.</i>

798
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:28,424
<i>Somehow I sensed it.</i>

799
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,902
<i>They were waiting for me,</i>

800
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:33,345
<i>Cooper, Amory, Sullivan and Wheeler.</i>

801
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:40,769
- Just coffee, thank you.

802
00:49:45,024 --> 00:49:45,858
What's wrong?

803
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,920
- You see Jim Rogers last night?

804
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:49,755
- Yep.

805
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:50,756
- Where'd you see him last?

806
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,114
- Torch Club, why?

807
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:55,469
- We just saw Mrs. Rogers.

808
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:56,720
- So?

809
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:58,621
- We had to tell her that he was dead.

810
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:00,623
- Dead?

811
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,143
How did they spot him?

812
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:03,936
- We don't know if they did,

813
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,270
maybe it was just an accident.

814
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:06,170
- Accident!

815
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:09,941
I wish I knew how much
they got out of him.

816
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,693
- Nothing, if I know Jim.

817
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,154
Anyway, we've got to take that chance.

818
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:17,240
- Thank you.

819
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:18,432
- You wanna quit now?

820
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:20,870
- No.

821
00:50:20,894 --> 00:50:23,229
-All right, how'd you make out?

822
00:50:24,313 --> 00:50:26,148
- I gotta meet with Dutch tonight.

823
00:50:27,691 --> 00:50:29,586
Think I demonstrated
that I can handle myself.

824
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:30,587
He'll go for me.

825
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:31,422
- Good.

826
00:50:31,446 --> 00:50:34,382
When we move in, I don't
want to guess I wanna know.

827
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:37,344
I wanna smash the whole
rotten ring at once.

828
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:38,202
- You'd better.

829
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,764
Anything else?

830
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:41,830
- That's all for now.

831
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:06,689
- Are you mad?

832
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:11,545
- No, Honey.

833
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:15,823
Look, Gladys, I told you
before: it won't be long.

834
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,534
Whatever happens, it won't be long.

835
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:23,289
Just get outta town and stay
there until I send for you.

836
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,018
- When do you think that'll be?

837
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,627
- Soon.

838
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:31,606
Oh, don't kid yourself, Casey.

839
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,108
Once you start with Dutch Becker,

840
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:34,609
you're in it as long as he wants you.

841
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,403
Don't argue with me.

842
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:38,822
Casey, I can't let you do it.

843
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:41,116
I'm not gonna let you make money this way.

844
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,159
That's why I
wanted to meet with Dutch.

845
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:43,995
You knew that.

846
00:51:44,019 --> 00:51:47,455
- I know, but I like you too much.

847
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:48,772
I can't let you do it.

848
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:52,544
Casey, you'll learn to hate yourself.

849
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:53,920
Someday this will destroy you.

850
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,697
Oh, you don't know
what you're talking about.

851
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,657
- I don't?

852
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:01,368
Well, I'll tell you something:

853
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,847
I know plenty.

854
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:06,891
I can tell the cops
plenty about Dutch Becker.

855
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:07,727
I'll blow the whistle

856
00:52:07,751 --> 00:52:09,436
and blow this whole set up sky high.

857
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,438
- Shut up, Gladys.
- Don't tell me to shut up,

858
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:13,172
I know what I'm talking about.

859
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,633
I worked for Dutch.

860
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,848
I worked for Dutch for a long time.

861
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:40,240
- Please, please get out
of town and stay there.

862
00:53:12,481 --> 00:53:16,068
- I'd never do anything
to hurt you, Casey.

863
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:55,477
- Hi, Jack.

864
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:56,312
Dutch in?

865
00:54:56,336 --> 00:54:57,604
- Nobody's in.

866
00:54:57,628 --> 00:54:59,671
- That's funny, I was
supposed to meet him here.

867
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:02,150
- Did you try the warehouse?

868
00:55:02,174 --> 00:55:03,008
- Should I?

869
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,195
- Yeah, he called.

870
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:06,654
Told me to send you over there.

871
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:07,513
- Where is it?

872
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:13,661
- Third Avenue and Second Street, 207.

873
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:14,954
- Buy you a drink?

874
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,897
- It's bad enough to have to look at it.

875
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:29,344
<i>This was the
beginning or the end, or both.</i>

876
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:31,221
<i>You could take your pick.</i>

877
00:55:31,245 --> 00:55:33,372
<i>It was even money any
way you looked at it.</i>

878
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,727
<i>Once I walked down that alley
and into that warehouse,</i>

879
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,127
<i>there was no turning back.</i>

880
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:43,549
<i>The warehouse was as dark
and as still as death.</i>

881
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:49,447
<i>I had a choice: life in prison,</i>

882
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,849
<i>or the very good chance
of a bullet in the head.</i>

883
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:54,935
<i>I had no future either way.</i>

884
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,748
<i>I know now how a condemned man feels</i>

885
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,458
<i>when he takes that last long walk</i>

886
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,568
<i>to the little door at the end of the hall.</i>

887
00:56:58,790 --> 00:56:59,602
Hi Dutch.

888
00:56:59,626 --> 00:57:01,376
Got a cool head now, I hope.

889
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,378
- Yeah, cool enough.

890
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,566
I want you two to knock it off.

891
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,067
I need you both.

892
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,051
- We'll get along,

893
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,386
won't we Casey?

894
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:15,349
- Take a walk, Lou.

895
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:24,524
Got a lot of money stacked up here.

896
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,277
Behave yourself and
you can get part of it.

897
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:29,088
Be smart, take orders.

898
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:29,947
I like you.

899
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:33,551
- Whiskey?
- Good whiskey.

900
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:35,053
Bonded.

901
00:57:35,077 --> 00:57:37,162
I ought to know, I bonded it myself.

902
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,599
- Yeah, you ought to know.

903
00:57:39,623 --> 00:57:41,225
- This is just a sideline compared to

904
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:44,687
my other lines of merchandise.

905
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:45,522
I brought you down here

906
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:48,399
'cause I think you're good
at selling and delivering.

907
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:50,092
Emptying a truckload of whiskey.

908
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:54,447
- Yeah, I get along.

909
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,823
- Yeah, I know.

910
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,283
I don't ever make a move, Casey,

911
00:57:57,307 --> 00:57:58,850
until I'm sure of my man.

912
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:00,852
You're all right.

913
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,706
- Thanks.

914
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,458
- Start you off here
and you do a good job,

915
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:08,735
I'll move you on to bigger things, okay?

916
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:11,530
- Okay.

917
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:14,092
I'll turn my customer over to you.

918
00:58:14,116 --> 00:58:15,617
He wants 200 cases of bourbon.

919
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:18,638
- I like the way you operate, Casey.

920
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:20,682
When's he want delivery?

921
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:21,517
- Well, I don't know.

922
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:23,601
I'll have to contact him and find out.

923
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:24,978
- You do that.

924
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:26,688
Come on, we go downstairs.

925
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:28,773
I wanna show you something.

926
00:58:28,797 --> 00:58:29,631
Lou!

927
00:58:31,299 --> 00:58:33,653
I go nowhere with him.

928
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,053
- I go nowhere without him.

929
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:37,597
Let's go.

930
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:56,491
Twenty five gallons of 180
proof alcohol every hour.

931
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:59,095
25 gallons of rot gut.

932
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,579
- Well, some isn't, some isn't.

933
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:01,806
Depends on who we sell it to.

934
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:04,207
And what about my client?

935
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:05,625
- The very best, naturally.

936
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:11,298
Fifteen thousand gallons a
month is approximately $150,000.

937
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,360
Not a bad sideline, huh Casey?

938
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,218
Mm!

939
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,208
- Yeah?

940
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,002
- Casey?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

941
00:59:31,026 --> 00:59:32,503
- Johnny Cooper.

942
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:33,504
<i>Yeah.</i>

943
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,590
- Get out on the corner of
Fifth and Burton right away,

944
00:59:35,614 --> 00:59:37,759
I'll have a car pick you up.

945
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:39,093
- What for?

946
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:39,928
<i>We found a body.</i>

947
00:59:39,952 --> 00:59:41,828
<i>It could be Gladys Baker.</i>

948
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,295
- Okay, I'll be right down.

949
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:52,714
<i>Right.</i>

950
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:35,674
Well?

951
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:38,552
- It's Gladys.

952
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,263
- Let's go, Casey.

953
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:52,816
I'm sorry Casey.

954
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:56,736
- Why did they do that to her face?

955
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,261
All she wanted was someone to love her.

956
01:01:03,285 --> 01:01:05,245
- The question is, why did they kill her?

957
01:01:07,289 --> 01:01:08,850
Maybe I better get you off the job,

958
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:09,875
get you out of town.

959
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:14,355
- You want him on a bootleg rap?

960
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:15,213
- That'll do.

961
01:01:16,715 --> 01:01:18,633
-All right, but I'm
gonna tell you one thing:

962
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,320
when I get through with him,

963
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:22,429
maybe you won't have anybody left to book.

964
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:26,868
- Yeah?

965
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:27,702
<i>Dutch?</i>

966
01:01:27,726 --> 01:01:28,579
- Who's this?

967
01:01:28,603 --> 01:01:29,580
<i>Casey, can [see you?</i>

968
01:01:29,604 --> 01:01:31,038
- Where you been?

969
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,707
I've been trying to get you.

970
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:33,791
- I've been busy.

971
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,169
<i>Listen Mr. Martin,
you're working for me.</i>

972
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:37,753
<i>Keep yourself available.</i>

973
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,547
- Keep your shirt on.

974
01:01:39,571 --> 01:01:42,425
I talked to my contact,
when can I see you?

975
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:43,843
- Be here at eight o'clock tonight.

976
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:45,970
<i>You're the boss.</i>

977
01:01:45,994 --> 01:01:47,078
- Don't you forget it.

978
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:06,199
Well, on time for a change.

979
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:07,241
That's good.

980
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:09,243
- You ought to print time cards.

981
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:10,912
- Very sharp stuff, Casey.

982
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:12,103
Very sharp stuff.

983
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:20,129
- Yeah, Case always has to cause a laugh.

984
01:02:20,153 --> 01:02:21,238
Didn't you, Case?

985
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:26,451
- Get away from me.

986
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:28,286
- Sit down, Lou.

987
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:30,705
When's he want delivery?

988
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:38,147
- Saturday morning, early, 5:00 AM.

989
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,983
- Ah, what's he want?
- 200 cases of bourbon.

990
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:44,695
- You get the seven Gs from
him, he gets the bourbon.

991
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,113
- Okay, I'll see you around.

992
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:49,641
- Yeah, you do that if you have time, huh?

993
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:28,990
- He wants 200 cases, Saturday
morning, early 5:00 AM.

994
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:29,825
- That's great.

995
01:03:29,849 --> 01:03:31,534
- He wants the seven G's first.

996
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:32,684
- I thought he would.

997
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:38,749
Here.

998
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:39,710
- Marked?

999
01:03:39,734 --> 01:03:41,043
- Plenty.

1000
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:42,753
Make your delivery to the Sussex bar,

1001
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,922
9300 Railroad Avenue.

1002
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:46,757
We'll have a man in front for you.

1003
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:47,615
- Anything else?

1004
01:03:49,451 --> 01:03:50,262
- Boys at the lab

1005
01:03:50,286 --> 01:03:52,037
found some fingerprints on that trunk.

1006
01:03:53,872 --> 01:03:54,914
- Yeah, who's?

1007
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,155
- Lay off Terpe, Casey,

1008
01:04:08,179 --> 01:04:09,888
or you'll blow this plan sky high.

1009
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:28,531
I've got a hunch we're gonna
have to move fast, now.

1010
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:34,972
<i>I didn't care if
everything blew sky high.</i>

1011
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:38,768
<i>I didn't care if the
world ended now, tonight.</i>

1012
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:41,169
<i>I had one thing to do, only one.</i>

1013
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:25,023
- What's the matter?

1014
01:05:25,047 --> 01:05:26,524
Casey, you crazy or something?

1015
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:27,650
Why did you do it?

1016
01:05:27,674 --> 01:05:29,175
- Why'd I do What?

1017
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:31,487
What'd I do?

1018
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:33,656
You crazy, Casey!

1019
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,432
- You killed Gladys, why?

1020
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:50,131
Why?

1021
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:51,757
I don't know.

1022
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:52,657
-Why?

1023
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:56,470
- Dutch told me to do it, Case!

1024
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:58,663
Dutch told me to do it!

1025
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:27,150
- Casey!

1026
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:35,802
- Oh, you're lucky.

1027
01:06:35,826 --> 01:06:37,076
You're real lucky.

1028
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:39,537
I'm all right.

1029
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:43,500
- You better get outta here, fast.

1030
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:58,556
Well, what do we do now?

1031
01:07:03,895 --> 01:07:06,499
- We'll book him for being disorderly.

1032
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:07,857
Well he is, isn't he?

1033
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,711
- Yeah, he's disorderly.

1034
01:07:10,735 --> 01:07:11,569
- So we book him.

1035
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:33,108
- Hello.

1036
01:07:33,132 --> 01:07:34,401
<i>Casey?</i>

1037
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:35,486
- Yeah.

1038
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:38,030
- Get down here right
away, we've got to see you.

1039
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,949
- Well, that's taking
quite a chance, isn't it?

1040
01:07:39,973 --> 01:07:42,117
- Can't help it, we've got to take it.

1041
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:42,976
- "We?"

1042
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:45,937
Okay, I'll be right down.

1043
01:07:55,697 --> 01:07:56,924
What's the matter?

1044
01:07:56,948 --> 01:07:59,927
- I suppose I could ask
you that, but I won't.

1045
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:03,222
Terpe is conscious and crying
his eyes out for a mouthpiece.

1046
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:04,765
He's in bad shape.

1047
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:06,392
We slapped a no visitor tag on him,

1048
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:07,584
but word will get out.

1049
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:10,396
Can you switch delivery
to tomorrow morning?

1050
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,254
- I'll try.

1051
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:13,631
- Here, we got something for you.

1052
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:17,552
- Short wave transmitter.

1053
01:08:18,886 --> 01:08:20,054
Now this is the aerial.

1054
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:22,075
You put one line over,

1055
01:08:22,099 --> 01:08:23,659
back between your shoulder blades

1056
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:26,036
and one down through your sleeve.

1057
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,372
It has a radius of six blocks.

1058
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:31,292
All you do is switch it
on, put it in your pocket.

1059
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:32,275
We'll be listening.

1060
01:08:40,867 --> 01:08:42,595
- Dutch sees that, I'm dead!

1061
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,763
- Just be careful, he won't.

1062
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:46,432
- I like your confidence.

1063
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:48,892
- Put this on just
before you make delivery.

1064
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:51,020
Our sound truck will
re-broadcast your position

1065
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:52,587
and your conversation to us.

1066
01:08:53,921 --> 01:08:55,423
- We're in the stretch, Casey.

1067
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:57,110
If everything goes well,

1068
01:08:57,134 --> 01:08:58,801
the next couple of days should end it.

1069
01:09:26,746 --> 01:09:29,183
<i>Usually a man
gets by with five senses,</i>

1070
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:31,852
<i>sometimes he gets a sixth.</i>

1071
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:32,835
<i>I had it now.</i>

1072
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:37,507
<i>I know of 11 murders that
could be traced to Dutch.</i>

1073
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,321
<i>As I crossed the floor to him,</i>

1074
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:43,530
<i>I had the feeling that maybe</i>

1075
01:09:43,554 --> 01:09:45,723
<i>he was going to try for an even dozen.</i>

1076
01:09:54,107 --> 01:09:56,293
- What's the idea?

1077
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:57,652
Boys got worried.

1078
01:09:58,653 --> 01:09:59,589
- What about?

1079
01:09:59,613 --> 01:10:01,239
- You.
- Why?

1080
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:04,551
- Lou Terpe's in the prison
ward of the general hospital.

1081
01:10:04,575 --> 01:10:05,952
Any idea how he got there?

1082
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:08,555
- Or how come he mentioned
your name in a loud voice

1083
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:09,914
before he passed out?

1084
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:13,584
- We're listening, Casey.

1085
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:16,754
- Casey likes to talk with his fists.

1086
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:19,924
Maybe you ought to listen for a while.

1087
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:22,969
- Talk.

1088
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:31,936
- Okay Dutch.

1089
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,190
I know what happened to Gladys.

1090
01:10:37,608 --> 01:10:38,443
- So?

1091
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:42,756
- Terpe got drunk.

1092
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:44,282
He told me that he killed her,

1093
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:46,701
then he nailed me.

1094
01:10:47,827 --> 01:10:49,346
Maybe she deserved to die, maybe not.

1095
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:50,723
I don't know.

1096
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:54,309
But I went crazy and the
cops came and I beat it.

1097
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:56,061
It's lucky I didn't kill him.

1098
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,211
That's the whole story.

1099
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:00,465
- That's all the story?

1100
01:11:02,175 --> 01:11:04,343
- Dutch, I'm in this
business to make money.

1101
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:07,531
I got seven grand in my pocket.

1102
01:11:07,555 --> 01:11:08,949
If you don't wanna do business with me,

1103
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,099
I'll take it elsewhere.

1104
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:12,643
- Carlos.

1105
01:11:22,236 --> 01:11:23,237
Put it back.

1106
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:27,469
It's like I told you,

1107
01:11:27,493 --> 01:11:29,577
you tie up with me,
you don't make trouble.

1108
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:31,996
Here, wipe your face.

1109
01:11:33,581 --> 01:11:35,476
Gladys was dangerous.

1110
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:38,252
You can't afford to get soft, right?

1111
01:11:44,759 --> 01:11:48,447
- I'll tell my contact it's no deal.

1112
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:49,305
- Wait a minute.

1113
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:52,725
Who said it was no deal?

1114
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:55,311
Gimme the money.

1115
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:02,527
- Now he wants tomorrow morning, 5:00 AM.

1116
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:04,338
Tomorrow at 5:00 AM.

1117
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:05,756
Where do we make the delivery?

1118
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,824
- Sussex bar, 9300 Railroad Avenue.

1119
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:12,054
- Okay, 200 cases, Sussex Bar 5:00 AM.

1120
01:12:12,078 --> 01:12:13,514
You take care of it.

1121
01:12:13,538 --> 01:12:14,997
- Okay, I'll take care of it.

1122
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:21,420
That's the way it's done.

1123
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:26,634
Pick him up.

1124
01:12:29,595 --> 01:12:30,972
You ain't in good condition.

1125
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:34,159
- You gonna make a deal with him?

1126
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:36,245
- Well, I ain't gonna throw
seven G's down the drain

1127
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:37,955
because you're nervous.

1128
01:12:37,979 --> 01:12:39,981
Go clean yourself up, you look terrible.

1129
01:12:41,315 --> 01:12:43,001
Put a tail on Casey and keep him there

1130
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:44,545
and make sure it's somebody he don't know.

1131
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:46,129
- Right.

1132
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:48,030
- I liked him, liked him a lot.

1133
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,367
Makes me sad to think
he'd try and hurt me.

1134
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:57,015
I think maybe I go with
you in the morning.

1135
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:58,833
- I think that might be a good idea.

1136
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:00,877
- Shut up.

1137
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:20,330
- Burns, Sussex bar at 5:00 AM.

1138
01:13:20,354 --> 01:13:22,457
They're delivering 200 cases.

1139
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:23,709
- Good work.

1140
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:24,650
- They're nervous.

1141
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:27,028
Terpe got word out.

1142
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:29,215
They gave me a going over,

1143
01:13:29,239 --> 01:13:31,800
but I think I squared the beef.

1144
01:13:31,824 --> 01:13:34,469
- Don't worry about Terpe, he's in a coma.

1145
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:36,430
He won't be talking to
anybody for a while.

1146
01:13:36,454 --> 01:13:37,997
Relax. See ya.

1147
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:28,148
- You better be there, Cooper.

1148
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:29,983
My friends are still outside.

1149
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:30,818
<i>I'm going out now.</i>

1150
01:14:30,842 --> 01:14:32,819
<i>It's like you say,</i>

1151
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:35,054
<i>this should be the end
one way or the other.</i>

1152
01:14:36,055 --> 01:14:38,516
<i>See you soon, I hope.</i>

1153
01:14:39,392 --> 01:14:41,268
<i>I also hope I'm coming in clear.</i>

1154
01:15:24,645 --> 01:15:25,789
- What's your problem?

1155
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:27,398
- Boss wants to give you a lift.

1156
01:15:38,993 --> 01:15:39,970
- Watch the warehouse.

1157
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:41,746
We'll call you later.

1158
01:15:52,923 --> 01:15:54,067
- What's that for?

1159
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:57,070
- So you shouldn't hurt yourself.

1160
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:57,970
- What's the beef?

1161
01:15:58,888 --> 01:16:00,514
What are you down here for?

1162
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:02,516
- He's worried.

1163
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:06,788
I make money, Casey.
I make a lot of money.

1164
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:10,167
My organization makes money
because I trust people.

1165
01:16:10,191 --> 01:16:12,335
I hire people, I pay 'em good,

1166
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:14,070
then I expect them to work for me.

1167
01:16:14,945 --> 01:16:17,698
If they don't, I still
pay them, but personally.

1168
01:16:19,075 --> 01:16:22,453
<i>I'm sensitive, my feelings get hurt.</i>

1169
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:25,140
<i>What's the matter, you crazy?</i>

1170
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:26,808
<i>- They're not going to warehouse.</i>

1171
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:27,917
<i>Something's gone sour.</i>

1172
01:16:29,502 --> 01:16:33,106
- Cars one and three,
are you reading Casey?

1173
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:35,108
- Car three, Roger.

1174
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:36,050
- Car one, Roger.

1175
01:16:37,885 --> 01:16:38,761
- Third and Main.

1176
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:41,823
- Alright, we're moving out.

1177
01:16:41,847 --> 01:16:43,933
Our latest fix is Third and Main.

1178
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:50,314
- Keep talking, Casey. Keep talking.

1179
01:17:01,242 --> 01:17:02,159
- It's all clear.

1180
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:04,787
- That's what you think, Dutch.

1181
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:07,289
- Come on, get off the grudge.

1182
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:09,041
- What's the idea?

1183
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:11,311
- Maybe I'm psychic.

1184
01:17:11,335 --> 01:17:13,170
Then again, maybe I'm crazy.

1185
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:17,359
What's the matter, you ticklish?

1186
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:19,218
- Keep your fat hands to yourself.

1187
01:17:21,929 --> 01:17:24,157
- All right, what's the angle?

1188
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:27,268
- No angle, maybe I
think you're not loyal.

1189
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:31,832
Maybe I think you're a stool pigeon.

1190
01:17:31,856 --> 01:17:33,482
-And maybe you're nuts.

1191
01:17:35,568 --> 01:17:36,527
- We'll know soon.

1192
01:17:37,403 --> 01:17:39,840
We'll make a call in a little while.

1193
01:17:39,864 --> 01:17:42,050
<i>Maybe there'll be cops
all over the warehouse,</i>

1194
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:43,552
<i>all around the Sussex bar.</i>

1195
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:44,761
<i>You think?</i>

1196
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:46,680
<i>What have you been smoking?</i>

1197
01:17:46,704 --> 01:17:48,390
<i>Anyway, they
don't find anything.</i>

1198
01:17:48,414 --> 01:17:49,933
<i>Everything is clean.</i>

1199
01:17:49,957 --> 01:17:51,768
<i>Dutch is clean.</i>

1200
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:54,688
<i>You, Casey? Disappear.</i>

1201
01:17:54,712 --> 01:17:57,149
<i>The cops think you ran out on them.</i>

1202
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:59,049
So maybe I'm wrong, we'll see.

1203
01:18:00,134 --> 01:18:02,445
If I'm wrong, you've got
nothing to worry about, right?

1204
01:18:02,469 --> 01:18:03,721
- That's right.

1205
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:08,160
Where are we going?

1206
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:09,828
<i>For a drive.</i>

1207
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:11,454
<i>There ought to be
a prettier place to drive</i>

1208
01:18:11,478 --> 01:18:12,646
<i>than Fifth and Broadway.</i>

1209
01:18:14,648 --> 01:18:17,210
- Cars one and three, keep close.

1210
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:18,611
<i>Fifth and Broadway.</i>

1211
01:18:25,451 --> 01:18:27,369
- Mr. Martin doesn't like the scenery.

1212
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:31,165
Maybe he'll be around
long enough to enjoy it.

1213
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:34,186
<i>But don't worry about it.</i>

1214
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:36,212
<i>You know, I don't like to worry.</i>

1215
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:41,050
- That's why you had
Gladys killed, wasn't it?

1216
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:43,510
- Yeah.

1217
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:46,990
Yeah, that's why I had Gladys killed.

1218
01:18:47,014 --> 01:18:48,015
- Good work, Casey.

1219
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:51,143
- You just fried yourself, Dutch.

1220
01:18:52,019 --> 01:18:54,456
- No loose ends, huh Dutch?

1221
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,814
- No loose ends.

1222
01:18:57,691 --> 01:18:58,628
- That's what I like about you, Dutch.

1223
01:18:58,652 --> 01:19:00,236
You're smart and you're big.

1224
01:19:01,445 --> 01:19:03,840
- You've got no idea how big,

1225
01:19:03,864 --> 01:19:06,283
or how dangerous it is to try and hurt me.

1226
01:19:08,118 --> 01:19:09,888
Pull around the corner Big.

1227
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:11,038
Make our call now.

1228
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:23,884
- One question.

1229
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:25,678
- Go ahead.

1230
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:29,616
- How big are you?

1231
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,493
- I own men and women, Casey.

1232
01:19:31,517 --> 01:19:34,371
All over the country, I own 'em.

1233
01:19:34,395 --> 01:19:36,164
Some of 'em like to gamble,

1234
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:37,707
some of 'em like to drink,

1235
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:40,150
but I own 'em body and soul.

1236
01:19:41,151 --> 01:19:42,069
I own them.

1237
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:46,591
Right?

1238
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:47,449
Carlos!

1239
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:52,138
- Cooper, 10th and Broadway, fast!

1240
01:19:52,162 --> 01:19:53,080
- Let's go.

1241
01:19:57,376 --> 01:19:59,545
- Carlos, leave him alone.

1242
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:02,923
Get out of here, fast!

1243
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:31,869
- I'm gonna kill you, Dutch.

1244
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,221
Now you're gonna know how Gladys felt,

1245
01:20:33,245 --> 01:20:35,307
only with you it's gonna take longer.

1246
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:38,500
Casey!

1247
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:53,891
- Come on, get up.

1248
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:04,210
- From now on, he's
living on borrowed time.

1249
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:05,795
- Come on, let's go.

1250
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:06,695
Move!

1251
01:21:11,492 --> 01:21:12,826
- You all right?

1252
01:21:14,244 --> 01:21:15,056
- Yeah.

1253
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:16,413
- It's all over.

1254
01:21:18,582 --> 01:21:19,726
Come on, lemme take care of that head.

1255
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:21,102
- No, I'm all right.

1256
01:21:21,126 --> 01:21:22,753
- You sure? Lemme drive you home.

1257
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:26,608
- You go ahead.

1258
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:27,466
- Okay.

1259
01:21:29,635 --> 01:21:31,136
Well, we got the big boy.

1260
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:33,555
Now watch the rats run.

1261
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:37,702
<i>Yes, it was all over.</i>

1262
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:40,288
<i>The job was done for Cooper
and the rest of them.</i>

1263
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:42,439
<i>For me, I don't know.</i>

1264
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:45,609
<i>Maybe the rats will run, maybe they won't.</i>

1265
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:47,837
<i>Maybe I'll have a chance to do</i>

1266
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:50,882
<i>some of the things I should
have done a long time ago,</i>

1267
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:54,052
<i>helping people like Lucille and Junie.</i>

1268
01:21:54,076 --> 01:21:57,138
<i>I know that I want to
make something of my life.</i>

1269
01:21:57,162 --> 01:21:58,038
<i>I'm going to try.</i>

1270
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:02,376
<i>I hope I live long enough to prove it.</i>
