1
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,650
Strange looking place.

2
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,670
What I thought.

3
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,590
Fuel pump.

4
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,180
How long you think
it'll take you to fix?

5
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,910
Has to be replaced.

6
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,890
Take about a half an hour
if they have the part.

7
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,510
Hm.

8
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,610
They should have one with
all these wrecks around here.

9
00:02:22,551 --> 00:02:24,541
This back highway's good for
time, but have car trouble

10
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:26,381
and you've got problems.

11
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:29,461
If it had to happen, I'm
glad it happened where it did

12
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:30,990
and when it did.

13
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,010
I didn't much relish the idea of
being stuck on those mountains.

14
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,600
I'd say we're lucky.

15
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,421
Another few miles, we'd
have been in desert.

16
00:02:37,521 --> 00:02:39,900
Is it what you
thought, Mr. Stiles?

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,411
I'm afraid so.

18
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:44,200
Can we still make the game?

19
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,990
Oh, we got 40 miles to go.

20
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:47,940
12:01.

21
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,180
Game doesn't start 'til 1:30.

22
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,110
We can still make it
if they have the part.

23
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,735
And if they don't?

24
00:02:55,835 --> 00:02:57,261
It's plain stuck.

25
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:59,290
If it wasn't Sunday, they
could order one from Lancaster.

26
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,750
Where are the people
who run this place?

27
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,821
Hello?

28
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,570
You see, when the
player swats the ball--

29
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,730
Not swats the ball, Doris.

30
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:44,331
Bats.

31
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:45,331
The player bats the ball.

32
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:45,920
Yeah.

33
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,190
When the player bats the ball
and it goes over the fence--

34
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,020
That's a home run.

35
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,620
I know.

36
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,345
But if no one can
make him out, why

37
00:03:51,445 --> 00:03:53,070
does he have to run
around the bases?

38
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,205
Because he has to.

39
00:03:54,305 --> 00:03:55,241
That's the rules.

40
00:03:55,341 --> 00:03:57,085
He must touch every base.

41
00:03:57,185 --> 00:03:58,930
Would you like a Coke?

42
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,570
Oh, thank you.

43
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,750
Somebody can run off
with the whole place

44
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,010
and the owner would
never know it.

45
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,845
Coke, Ed?

46
00:04:15,945 --> 00:04:17,180
Sure.

47
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,281
From the looks
of things, nothing

48
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:24,590
'round here worth taking.

49
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,530
It's a wonder they get
any business at all.

50
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,990
Everything is so
dirty and greasy.

51
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,700
All work isn't white
collar work, Miss Page.

52
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,400
I was in the Army.

53
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,410
I had my fill of
this repairing tanks.

54
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,770
Miss Prim and Proper
should have known me then.

55
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:50,610
Doris Page is a sweet girl,
Ed, and a good math teacher.

56
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:53,380
Uh, a little on the
prudish side, perhaps.

57
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:59,221
A boy in my phys ed class
calls her Miss Ice Buckets.

58
00:04:59,321 --> 00:05:02,101
Mr. Oliver, I think
theirs is a, a silly rule.

59
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:04,301
There is no reason why a man
should have to run around

60
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:07,160
the bases when they
can't get him out.

61
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,500
Isn't that a woman for you?

62
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,221
Never seen a baseball
game and already

63
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:12,780
she's changing the rules.

64
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,555
You should go to a
ball game with my wife.

65
00:05:15,655 --> 00:05:18,231
Well, I still think
that's a silly rule.

66
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:21,520
We're never going to
see any baseball today.

67
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,490
Where's the guy that
runs this place?

68
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,370
Hey, what about some service?

69
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,210
Hello?

70
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,161
They must be around
here some place.

71
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,750
Doesn't seem likely
they'd go away

72
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:57,550
and leave everything wide open.

73
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,080
Perhaps they're around
in back some place.

74
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,060
Hey, anybody here?

75
00:06:06,311 --> 00:06:07,510
Hello?

76
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,720
Hello?

77
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,880
If the pump hadn't already
been stripped off that Chevy,

78
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,231
we might be in business.

79
00:06:50,151 --> 00:06:53,350
We got ourselves a fuel
pump if it's any good.

80
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:56,061
Will that work on our car?

81
00:06:56,161 --> 00:06:58,940
Take a few adjustments,
but should get us to LA.

82
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,980
I'll borrow a few wrenches,
and we'll soon be out of here.

83
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,261
Our Mr. Stiles
has many talents.

84
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:12,320
A fine young man.

85
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,800
Be a lucky woman that hooks him.

86
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,340
Oh, Mr. Oliver, I do believe
you're playing Cupid again.

87
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,050
You're only young
once, Miss Page.

88
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,370
Why, Mr. Oliver, you
sound like an old man.

89
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,131
Well, 52 yesterday.

90
00:07:38,231 --> 00:07:42,830
I'd say you'd had a
fine and full life.

91
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:47,730
A nice home, a lovely wife,
two handsome children.

92
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:52,630
Carl Junior graduates from
West Point in two weeks.

93
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,340
Wife and I are going
back for the graduation.

94
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,240
This guy really takes
care of his tools.

95
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:58,840
Hm.

96
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,101
Wonder where these people are.

97
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:01,940
I'll look around and see
if I can find somebody.

98
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:11,355
I don't want to
shock you, Miss Page,

99
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:13,690
but I'd rather not
get my shirt dirty.

100
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,960
Oh really, Mr. Stiles,
I'm not that stuffy.

101
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,260
I don't know.

102
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,445
We've taught the same
school for over a year

103
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:24,530
and it's still Miss
Page and Mr. Stiles.

104
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,930
I do think Ed and Doris
would sound a lot better.

105
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,430
From now on it shall
be Ed and Doris.

106
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,480
Just a snake skin.

107
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,600
They shed this time of year.

108
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,475
I can't stand snakes.

109
00:08:50,575 --> 00:08:52,250
Most people can't.

110
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:56,355
Part of the country's
loaded with them, big ones.

111
00:08:56,455 --> 00:09:00,460
I hear they get to be as
much as nine feet long.

112
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,250
Well, I was certainly
wrong, wasn't I?

113
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,000
Hello?

114
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,650
Hello?

115
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,950
Anybody here?

116
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:38,490
Hello?

117
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:56,921
Hello?

118
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:01,320
Doris?

119
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,665
Ed?

120
00:11:02,765 --> 00:11:04,511
Hello?

121
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,170
Hello?

122
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,530
You'd never know
he's the same history

123
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,490
teacher from old Lancaster High.

124
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:30,080
He really cuts loose.

125
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,300
Today he'll really be in
this glory with his red flag.

126
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,731
I know.

127
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:35,821
Edna told me last night
that he hasn't seen them

128
00:11:35,921 --> 00:11:37,831
play since they left Cincinnati.

129
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,610
She said ever since he got
the tickets he's been--

130
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,370
There's something going on
here that just isn't right.

131
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:45,130
Settings were four at the
kitchen table, two plates eaten

132
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,900
from and two plates
untouched, pie still warm.

133
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,570
Except for a cat there's
not a sign of life.

134
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,210
The sooner we get out of here,
the better off I'll feel.

135
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,165
Just keep working,
mister, because you're

136
00:12:35,265 --> 00:12:37,247
going to fix your car
just like you intended.

137
00:12:37,347 --> 00:12:39,330
Young man, you have
no right to take our--

138
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,220
Shut up.

139
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,490
What if I don't fix it?

140
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,070
You'll fix it
all right, mister.

141
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,751
You better not take
too long, either.

142
00:12:49,851 --> 00:12:53,570
Supposing I get it
fixed, what happens then?

143
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,390
Me and my girl go away
and won't bother you.

144
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,365
Ah, ah,
ah, ah, ah, ah.

145
00:13:00,465 --> 00:13:03,240
How do we know
you'll keep your word?

146
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,130
Looks like you're just going to
have take it, ain'tcha, mister?

147
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,115
Bang!

148
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,840
You, give me your wallet.

149
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:34,590
There's not much, but
you're welcome to it.

150
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:38,350
Well, we're only
schoolteachers, young man.

151
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,070
You hear that, Judy?

152
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:44,770
"We're only schoolteachers."

153
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,840
We don't like
schoolteachers, do we, Judy?

154
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,611
Teachers think they're so much
smarter than everybody else.

155
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,000
You have our money.

156
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,525
Isn't that enough?

157
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,950
What else do you want?

158
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:32,350
Just keep
working, mister.

159
00:15:49,220 --> 00:16:02,970
Teachers used to call
Judy dumb, make fun of her,

160
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,701
send her home from
school crying.

161
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,480
No!

162
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,680
Stop it!

163
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,421
You're a pretty good size, boy.

164
00:16:21,521 --> 00:16:23,511
I wonder how tough you'd
be without that gun.

165
00:16:23,611 --> 00:16:27,960
Ooh, you're one
of them real big talkers,

166
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,810
ain't you, mister?

167
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:33,800
All right, big talker,
hand over your wallet.

168
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:39,930
Come on.

169
00:16:48,651 --> 00:16:50,441
Pick it up.

170
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,750
You pick it up.

171
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,875
You're a real big man in
front of your lady friend.

172
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:59,537
But I'm going to show her
just how big you really are.

173
00:16:59,637 --> 00:17:02,529
Put down that gun and I'll
show you how big you are.

174
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:05,521
I'm giving you three seconds,
mister, to do what I say.

175
00:17:05,621 --> 00:17:07,810
I'm saying you pick
up that wallet.

176
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,590
One, two.

177
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,230
Please, do as he says.

178
00:17:24,551 --> 00:17:29,160
Uh, you
put on the fender.

179
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,591
Or do you want the gun, huh?

180
00:17:30,691 --> 00:17:31,790
You want the gun?

181
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,480
On the fender.

182
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:48,080
Big man, huh?

183
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:52,340
I guess you got showed
how big you really was.

184
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,650
Start working.

185
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,311
May I get some water?

186
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:24,531
This poor man has been
blinded by his own blood.

187
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,511
Don't you even have the decency
to let me care for this man?

188
00:18:34,611 --> 00:18:38,270
What kind of a person are you?

189
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:43,391
Do you enjoy hurting
others, seeing them in pain?

190
00:18:43,491 --> 00:18:47,330
How can you be so inhuman?

191
00:19:15,461 --> 00:19:17,300
Eh, uh, uh uh, uh.

192
00:19:49,241 --> 00:19:49,840
How is he?

193
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,770
His head is all right,
but I know it must hurt.

194
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:55,041
The gash in his cheek
isn't too, too bad,

195
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:58,171
but the cut over his eye,
it won't stop bleeding.

196
00:19:58,271 --> 00:20:01,201
I'm afraid he might
bleed to death.

197
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:04,231
Now, now, Doris, it
can't be that bad.

198
00:20:04,331 --> 00:20:05,360
Where do you
think you're going?

199
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,560
This man needs
help, and he's going

200
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:08,260
to get it if you
want this car fixed.

201
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,040
He's going to be
all right, Doris.

202
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,591
You're lucky, Carl.

203
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,440
A little more to the right
you wouldn't be here.

204
00:20:41,211 --> 00:20:42,710
If we can get you some
water and in the shade

205
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,111
we can stop the bleeding.

206
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:46,890
What about letting this
man get in the shade?

207
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,051
How can you be so cruel?

208
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:54,121
You get back in that car, and
he won't be needing nothing.

209
00:21:00,241 --> 00:21:03,710
Oh, by all means,
enjoy your lovemaking.

210
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,790
Well, the least
you can do is allow

211
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:07,770
a suffering man a little water.

212
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,430
Carrying on like that when--
you're no more than an animal!

213
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,730
You get your dirty hands off me.

214
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,830
You leave her alone if
you want the car fixed.

215
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,870
And he won't fix it unless
you let us get some water.

216
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,011
There's a pump by the house.

217
00:21:33,111 --> 00:21:34,880
You keep working
on that car, mister.

218
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,900
And you, go ahead.

219
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,710
Shoot if they move, Judy.

220
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:14,370
If I hear a shot, your
girlfriend is dead.

221
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,110
Don't get no ideas.

222
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,800
Judy don't know
how to use a gun.

223
00:23:09,051 --> 00:23:15,220
I wonder, I wonder why
he changed his mind.

224
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,380
Ed, I don't like this.

225
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,250
I know something else
you won't like, Carl.

226
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,460
Remember reading last week
about those brutal killings

227
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,085
in Arizona?

228
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,890
Will you please let me by?

229
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,065
Why are you putting us
through this torture?

230
00:25:09,165 --> 00:25:11,650
You have our money and
you're taking our car.

231
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:12,770
Isn't that enough?

232
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:16,810
You keep your
dirty hands off me.

233
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,091
You think your so
much better than me.

234
00:25:20,191 --> 00:25:24,020
Your kind all think that way.

235
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,751
You called me inhuman.

236
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,070
All right.

237
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:28,720
I apologize.

238
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,730
I shouldn't have said that.

239
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,550
Now, will you let me go?

240
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,370
Called me an animal.

241
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,680
I'm sorry.

242
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,221
I'm sorry I said those things.

243
00:25:38,321 --> 00:25:39,190
Now, can I go?

244
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:41,770
You're sorry, but
you still think it.

245
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,480
You think I'm dirt.

246
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,091
You think Judy's dirt.

247
00:25:45,191 --> 00:25:48,420
You'll always think it 'til
you don't think no more.

248
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,101
Your kind means
nothing, you hear?

249
00:25:51,201 --> 00:25:52,300
Nothing.

250
00:25:55,071 --> 00:25:58,590
Why don't you scream?

251
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,400
Maybe the big talker
will come and help you.

252
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,355
Maybe Miss Goodie
Good Good still

253
00:26:04,455 --> 00:26:06,310
thinks she's so
much better than me.

254
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:14,790
How does it feel to be
touched by dirt, huh?

255
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,420
Goodie Good Good don't like it.

256
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,240
Taste it.

257
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,600
Taste it!

258
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,630
Eat the dirt.

259
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:29,160
Taste it.

260
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,061
Miss Goodie Good don't think
she's so much now, does she?

261
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,101
She don't mind being
touched by dirt.

262
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,465
Get moving.

263
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,730
What did he do to you, child?

264
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,951
It's all right, Mr. Oliver.

265
00:28:17,051 --> 00:28:18,950
It's all right.

266
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,660
Get back to work.

267
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,100
You want that car fixed,
you can do it yourself.

268
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,090
Starting to be the
big man again, huh?

269
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,610
You're the big man, Tibbs.

270
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,130
That's the name, isn't it?

271
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,590
Charlie Tibbs?

272
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:51,020
The big man who
killed seven people.

273
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,911
Made them get on their knees
and shot them in the head.

274
00:28:54,011 --> 00:28:55,881
The paper calls you
a thrill killer.

275
00:28:55,981 --> 00:28:58,190
Must be a real thrill to
wipe out a family of five.

276
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:00,500
How many thrills have you
had since you left Arizona?

277
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,590
What about the people here?

278
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:02,490
Did you kill them too?

279
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,861
How long do you
think you could keep

280
00:29:03,961 --> 00:29:05,600
getting away with this, son?

281
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,280
The law's bound to catch up
with you sooner or later.

282
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,260
And the law has ways
of handling murderers.

283
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,840
Please don't
antagonize him any more.

284
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,305
What's going to happen to you?

285
00:29:14,405 --> 00:29:15,770
Anybody opens
their mouth again,

286
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,270
I'll blow their brains out.

287
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,350
Listen, big man, you get
back to fixing that car,

288
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,260
or you're going to be
a big dead man fast.

289
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:34,275
All of a sudden
everybody's becoming

290
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:37,911
the big talker,
getting kind of brave.

291
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,660
Nobody wants to
talk no more, Judy.

292
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,490
I'm going
to get my goodie bag.

293
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,960
Judy, bring me a soda.

294
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:05,701
Just a little target practice.

295
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,370
I'm going to shake
the bottle over

296
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:29,561
head.

297
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:34,760
Mr. Oliver, they're going
to do something terrible,

298
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,260
I just know it.

299
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,770
You, get up.

300
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,051
Over there.

301
00:34:07,151 --> 00:34:08,031
What are you going to do?

302
00:34:08,131 --> 00:34:09,440
Shut up.

303
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:13,690
Move!

304
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:17,491
That's far enough.

305
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:24,360
Down on your knees.

306
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,631
On your knees!

307
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:33,420
Seeing as how you like to
talk, go ahead and talk.

308
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,420
Talk all you want.

309
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,400
As soon as I finish this, you
going to be through talking.

310
00:34:42,011 --> 00:34:43,810
School be out for you, teacher.

311
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,440
You better start
talking, mister.

312
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,130
Your time's running out.

313
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:06,440
You can't shoot me like this
for no reason, for nothing.

314
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,031
Surely blowing my head off
can't give you a thrill.

315
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,750
Is it money you need?

316
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:19,991
I have close to
$2,300 in the bank.

317
00:35:20,091 --> 00:35:22,355
Tomorrow you can call my wife.

318
00:35:22,455 --> 00:35:24,620
She'll give it to
you, all of it.

319
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,881
You and your girlfriend can
have a lot of fun on $2,300.

320
00:35:30,981 --> 00:35:32,921
He sure is talking
a lot different

321
00:35:33,021 --> 00:35:37,410
than he did a while
ago, ain't he, Judy?

322
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:41,160
You have a father, don't you?

323
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,460
Would you want someone
doing this to him?

324
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:50,951
Think of your own father
in my place, or yours.

325
00:35:51,051 --> 00:35:53,370
Save your
breath on her, mister.

326
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,871
I'm the only thing
in the world she has.

327
00:35:55,971 --> 00:36:00,080
Her old man's dead, and
her old lady's a drunk.

328
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:09,730
Young lady, can't you
realize this is wrong?

329
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:12,160
You love him, don't you?

330
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,030
You know what it is to be
around someone you love

331
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,990
and who loves you?

332
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:23,001
I have loved ones too, a
daughter a little older

333
00:36:23,101 --> 00:36:26,690
than you, a son about his age.

334
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:38,120
Please, I beg of you,
talk to your boyfriend.

335
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,260
Tell him this is wrong.

336
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,780
Tell him, please.

337
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,070
My god, child, haven't
you any feelings at all?

338
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,020
Can't you understand?

339
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,680
Look at him squirm, Judy.

340
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,710
They're all alike, ain't they?

341
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:05,530
Yellow when they go.

342
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:25,430
You just can't wipe out a man's
life like this, not like this.

343
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:28,190
We just can't stand
here and watch.

344
00:37:28,290 --> 00:37:31,175
Ed, you can't let him do this.

345
00:37:31,275 --> 00:37:34,160
Maybe he'll listen to you.

346
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,510
Talk to him.

347
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:36,761
Ed, talk to him.

348
00:37:36,861 --> 00:37:41,030
Make
somebody do something.

349
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:42,580
Tell him you won't fix the car.

350
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,410
Don't let him do it.

351
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:44,890
You want the car fixed?

352
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:48,130
Maybe the big man wants
to take your place.

353
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:52,470
He says one more word, he will.

354
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:54,080
What about it, big man.

355
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,690
You feel like talking?

356
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,530
Maybe Miss Good Good
wants to take his place.

357
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:12,411
I guess nobody wants to
take your place, mister.

358
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:39,921
School's out, teacher.

359
00:38:43,431 --> 00:38:44,050
No.

360
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:46,090
No, please.

361
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,440
Don't.

362
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,960
Ed, Miss Page.

363
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,321
You
monster, you monster!

364
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,816
Doris, Doris.

365
00:39:01,916 --> 00:39:03,311
Go ahead, do it.

366
00:39:03,411 --> 00:39:04,181
Shut up.

367
00:39:04,281 --> 00:39:04,880
Shut up yourself.

368
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,291
Doris, get control of yourself.

369
00:39:06,391 --> 00:39:07,960
And you, you coward.

370
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,560
Doris!

371
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,410
Don't touch me.

372
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,880
Doris, you're going
to get us both shot.

373
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,520
I don't care.
I don't care.

374
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,940
Why don't you go
ahead and shoot?

375
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,780
Go on, shoot.

376
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,341
Go on, go on, shoot, shoot.

377
00:39:15,441 --> 00:39:16,540
I don't care.

378
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,170
In another couple of minutes,
I'll have the pump out.

379
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:29,920
Shut up.

380
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,120
It won't take very long
to put it in the other car.

381
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,000
I said shut up.

382
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,400
Look, you're going
to need that car now,

383
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,300
and I'm the only
one that can fix it.

384
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,320
I ain't waiting too long.

385
00:39:52,301 --> 00:39:55,391
Judy, go get me a
soda, and that pie too.

386
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,851
Poor Edna.

387
00:40:09,211 --> 00:40:13,740
How will anybody
be able to tell?

388
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,275
His son's graduation.

389
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:16,710
Doris, believe me.

390
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,221
I feel as badly as you.

391
00:40:19,321 --> 00:40:19,820
He's dead.

392
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,010
Nothing can bring him back.

393
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,550
We're alive.

394
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,191
We've got to think
of ourselves now.

395
00:40:32,191 --> 00:40:35,150
Do you think I wanted to
stand there and watch him die?

396
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:35,950
What could I do?

397
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,555
What could anyone have done?

398
00:40:37,655 --> 00:40:39,060
You can't reason with that kid.

399
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,480
He wants blood,
Doris, and nobody's

400
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,730
going to talk him out of it.

401
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:45,820
Don't you understand
what we're dealing with?

402
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,260
He's a psycho, Doris.

403
00:40:51,161 --> 00:40:52,646
Or should I have
taken his place?

404
00:40:52,746 --> 00:40:54,131
Would that have made
you feel better?

405
00:40:54,231 --> 00:40:56,480
What would you be saying to Carl
if it was me lying over there?

406
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:24,975
The pump's out.

407
00:41:25,075 --> 00:41:26,720
All right.

408
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:30,560
Put it in the other car.

409
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:03,100
Ed, I'm sorry.

410
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,300
Forget it.

411
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,150
I feel so ashamed for
acting the way I did.

412
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,141
There was nothing we could do.

413
00:42:27,791 --> 00:42:30,170
Why don't we just run?

414
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:33,455
The highway is only a
few yards from here.

415
00:42:33,555 --> 00:42:37,562
He'd cut us down
before we got five feet.

416
00:42:37,662 --> 00:42:41,670
I'll die running before
I get on my knees.

417
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:44,781
I can still see him
drinking with us.

418
00:43:34,841 --> 00:43:38,990
Maybe a car will
come by and stop.

419
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:39,721
Sure, Doris.

420
00:43:39,821 --> 00:43:42,530
Maybe a car will pull in.

421
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:48,970
Supposing a car does
pull in, they won't know.

422
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:52,701
He'll kill them and us too.

423
00:43:52,801 --> 00:43:57,530
The police, maybe the
police will pass by.

424
00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:00,671
They do patrol this highway.

425
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:02,430
They will, Ed.

426
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:04,090
They will.

427
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:05,680
Sure they will.

428
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:18,280
They'll find a way to
make them stop then.

429
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:22,651
Doris, miracles do happen,
but you can't count on them.

430
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,995
I'm sorry.

431
00:44:29,095 --> 00:44:30,591
Now listen.

432
00:44:30,691 --> 00:44:33,661
I'm going to try to find out
how many more shots he has left

433
00:44:33,761 --> 00:44:35,065
or if he has reloaded or not.

434
00:44:35,165 --> 00:44:36,970
But how will we find out?

435
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:43,190
Four shots we know
of, that leaves four.

436
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:46,140
He probably shot
the people here too.

437
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:46,870
There must have been two.

438
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:49,220
Remember what Carl told us about
the settings in the kitchen.

439
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:49,820
Yes.

440
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,300
Two plates eaten from
and two plates untouched.

441
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,530
Tibbs must have surprised
them while they were eating.

442
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:57,320
They were to frightened
to eat while those two

443
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,300
were stuffing themselves.

444
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,890
If he shot them, that
leaves two shots.

445
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:05,480
He certainly didn't
walk here from Arizona.

446
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:06,910
Maybe he shot someone else.

447
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:08,840
And if he hasn't reloaded--

448
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:37,555
Go ahead and talk, mister.

449
00:45:37,655 --> 00:45:40,280
You talk all you want.

450
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:42,900
You thinking somebody's
going to save you.

451
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,300
Why should I fix the car if
you're going to kill us anyhow?

452
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,520
You'll fix it because
that lets you live

453
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:51,745
a little longer,
like back there.

454
00:45:51,845 --> 00:45:54,870
I know that you were stalling.

455
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:57,810
If you don't want to fix
the car, you die right now.

456
00:45:57,910 --> 00:45:59,360
You want this car, Tibbs.

457
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,400
Who are you fooling?

458
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,950
Oh, you can kill us,
but you'd be stranded.

459
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:04,870
That's a road, ain't it?

460
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,950
Where there's a
road, there's cars.

461
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:09,840
Somebody will pick us up.

462
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:13,070
They always have.

463
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:15,360
Is that how you got
here from Arizona?

464
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:17,225
A sailor picked us up.

465
00:46:17,325 --> 00:46:18,990
How far did he take you?

466
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:21,100
Better than real
love, huh, Judy?

467
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:25,950
Suppose you shot him too.

468
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:27,140
Naw.

469
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,910
I just cut his throat.

470
00:46:31,631 --> 00:46:33,770
Why haven't you
still got his car?

471
00:46:33,870 --> 00:46:35,850
Ran out of gas last night.

472
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:40,180
You're sure asking a lot
of questions, mister.

473
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,720
But you go ahead and
ask all you want.

474
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:45,140
How did you get here?

475
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,461
A farmer picked us up.

476
00:46:47,561 --> 00:46:51,250
His old crate broke down
up the road a piece.

477
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,100
Too bad.

478
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,270
I was beginning to
like that old codger.

479
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:57,160
Shoot him too?

480
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:00,481
He sure prayed when he
went, Judy, remember?

481
00:47:00,581 --> 00:47:03,360
He reached for the sky and
talked to the Lordy Lord.

482
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:08,930
Then you shot him.

483
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:10,431
Yeah.

484
00:47:10,531 --> 00:47:11,870
Right between the eyes.

485
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:19,531
What about the two
people you shot here?

486
00:47:19,631 --> 00:47:20,320
Did they pray too?

487
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,310
You must think I'm dumb,
mister, don't know nothing.

488
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,470
You're counting bullets.

489
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:31,995
Count all you want.

490
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:34,180
I can count too.

491
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:38,110
You know I only fired
seven shots, only got

492
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:41,100
one bullet left
unless I reloaded.

493
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,971
How many bullets do I have left?

494
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:53,610
Come on, come on.

495
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:56,420
You the big man.

496
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,020
Come on.

497
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,210
The one bullet's gone.

498
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,260
Come on, maybe the gun's empty.

499
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:01,860
Come on, mister.

500
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,890
I'm giving you a chance.

501
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:06,060
Come on, big man.

502
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:07,525
Come on, mister.

503
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:09,490
Come get the gun.

504
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,720
What's the matter, you afraid?

505
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,940
You had a chance, mister.

506
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,595
You should have taken it.

507
00:48:28,695 --> 00:48:31,107
You ain't gonna get no more.

508
00:48:31,207 --> 00:48:33,620
See how yellow they are, Judy?

509
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:37,080
Afraid of an empty gun.

510
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,320
Big man.

511
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,061
Big talker.

512
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:22,470
Push her

513
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:41,630
Ed, they're getting
ready to do something.

514
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:57,030
You.

515
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:58,610
No.

516
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,420
The police.

517
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,080
they're coming, Mr. Stiles.

518
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,920
I told you they would.

519
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:19,820
They will stop.

520
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,480
They will.

521
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,040
They will.

522
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,770
They're coming after him.

523
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:26,500
They're coming after you.

524
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,100
You hear me?

525
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,480
You, you, you're not
going to kill anymore!

526
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,380
Doris.

527
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:33,880
Get in back.

528
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:36,260
Get in back or I'll
kill you right now.

529
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,460
Do as I say!

530
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:40,911
Go!

531
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,870
Over there.

532
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:48,995
Lie down.

533
00:50:49,095 --> 00:50:51,020
Lie down!

534
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,040
They're stopping.

535
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,390
Get up.

536
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:15,770
Get to the car.

537
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:16,370
Hurry up.

538
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:19,155
It must be the police.

539
00:51:19,255 --> 00:51:21,840
You get in the trunk.

540
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:23,430
Get in there or I'll
blow your brains out!

541
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:29,200
One noise and your
lady friend dies.

542
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,790
Keep her out of sight.

543
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:32,990
She makes one noise,
you slit her throat.

544
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:17,030
Hi.

545
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:18,480
Hello, son.

546
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:35,421
Sure a scorcher.

547
00:52:35,521 --> 00:52:36,640
Sure is.

548
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:44,490
Don't recall having seen
you around here before, son.

549
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:46,650
Friend of the family.

550
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:50,331
Just talked to Milt's son
in town about an hour ago.

551
00:52:50,431 --> 00:52:52,270
Funny, being the
talker he is, didn't

552
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,660
mention anything about visitors.

553
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:57,050
Uh, he just left
before I got in.

554
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,565
Lancaster, huh?

555
00:53:12,665 --> 00:53:13,890
Yeah.

556
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:15,750
Been working on the car.

557
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:16,730
Fuel pump trouble.

558
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:18,420
Mine went out only last week.

559
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:20,960
You know, Jim, it cost
over $30 to get it fixed.

560
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:22,891
Boy, what a crook that guy was.

561
00:53:29,311 --> 00:53:31,450
Look, somebody lost a 45 clip.

562
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:47,020
Where is Milt?

563
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,560
Out back someplace.

564
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:56,530
Boy, he can get more parts of a
car than the factory put in it.

565
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:58,210
Yeah, he sure can.

566
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,315
Help!

567
00:54:13,415 --> 00:54:15,202
Help!

568
00:54:15,302 --> 00:54:17,641
Help!

569
00:54:19,705 --> 00:54:21,727
Help!

570
00:54:21,827 --> 00:54:23,138
Help!

571
00:54:23,238 --> 00:54:25,050
Help.

572
00:54:44,361 --> 00:54:45,560
Get out.

573
00:54:55,050 --> 00:54:56,690
I told you to keep quiet.

574
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:58,201
Should have done
what I told you.

575
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:08,330
Get moving.

576
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:27,730
Oh!

577
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,145
I told you
nobody could help you.

578
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:50,870
You're going to
have every officer

579
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:52,540
in California looking for you.

580
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,610
They don't scare me.

581
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:56,580
Nobody scares me.

582
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,770
I'm going to give you
a choice, big man.

583
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:02,680
You die now, or
you fix that car.

584
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:05,590
I'll give you 15
minutes to fix it.

585
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:07,560
Why should I fix it?

586
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:09,320
You'll only kill
us when I get done.

587
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,830
I'm giving you 15 more
minutes of life, mister.

588
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:14,560
If you don't want it, I'll
blow your head off right now.

589
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:15,930
Hers too.

590
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:21,935
It's 1 o'clock.

591
00:56:22,035 --> 00:56:23,842
You got until 1:15.

592
00:56:23,942 --> 00:56:25,750
You start working.

593
00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:16,940
Who would ever believe
something like this?

594
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:37,130
How could he
shoot two officers?

595
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:39,250
There were two of them.

596
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:40,690
Two of them.

597
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,300
Judy, give me that gun.

598
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:54,760
15 minutes.

599
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,341
What are we going to do?

600
00:57:59,311 --> 00:58:01,610
All units, all units,

601
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:04,920
be on the alert for two Arizona
murder suspects believed to be

602
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:09,770
in California, possibly driving
a green 1958 Ford sedan,

603
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:13,900
license number Mary
Nora 4-6-9-8-3.

604
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,080
Suspects hitched ride with the
driver of this car, a sailor

605
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:18,870
en route to San Diego.

606
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:21,730
The sailor was found murdered
two miles east of Needles

607
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:24,211
approximately 10:30 this date.

608
00:58:24,311 --> 00:58:27,910
Tibbs, Charles A, male
Caucasian, age 20.

609
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:29,630
Light brown hair, blue eyes.

610
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:33,431
Height 6'1", Weight
approximately 180 pounds.

611
00:58:33,531 --> 00:58:34,311
Fair complexion.

612
00:58:34,411 --> 00:58:37,241
Wearing Levi jacket
pants when last seen.

613
00:58:37,341 --> 00:58:41,930
This suspect is armed and to be
considered extremely dangerous.

614
00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:43,560
In company with
suspect number one

615
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:47,351
is Bradshaw, Judy,
female Caucasian, age 18.

616
00:58:47,451 --> 00:58:48,960
Black hair, blue eyes.

617
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:51,550
Height approximately
5'4", weight

618
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:53,850
approximately 100 pounds.

619
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:55,301
Dark complexion.

620
00:58:55,401 --> 00:58:58,120
Wearing a yellow flowered
dress when last seen.

621
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:07,950
If only that radio call had
come two minutes earlier.

622
00:59:08,050 --> 00:59:09,440
We've got to do something.

623
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,391
Looks like we'll
have to run for it.

624
00:59:24,927 --> 00:59:27,730
Move closer.

625
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:29,250
Get in front of me.

626
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,201
I got an idea.

627
00:59:34,301 --> 00:59:36,721
It may not work, but
at least it's a chance.

628
00:59:36,821 --> 00:59:39,241
It's obvious he doesn't
know much about cars.

629
00:59:39,341 --> 00:59:41,380
Now look, when I
get the pump in,

630
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,780
I'll ask you to get in
the car and start it.

631
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,181
Leave it in neutral.

632
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:46,690
I'll race the motor from here.

633
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:49,560
When I give you the
first signal-- uh,

634
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:51,040
I'll scratch my shoulder.

635
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:54,620
When I do, you shift into drive
and push down on the brake.

636
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:55,320
Got that?

637
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:56,520
Yes.

638
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,530
When I give you
the second signal--

639
01:00:03,630 --> 01:00:06,460
I'll wink-- hold on tight
because I'll be pulling

640
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,430
the gas pedal to the floorboard.

641
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:11,370
I'm going to try to lure
him in front of the car.

642
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,260
Oh, Ed.

643
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:22,490
It's just a chance.

644
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:25,680
We might not hit him, but if
we can at least startle him,

645
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:27,191
it may give me the
few seconds I need.

646
01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:34,640
Let's just pray this
doesn't kick out on us.

647
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:37,715
What if it does?

648
01:00:37,815 --> 01:00:40,690
Run for it.

649
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:43,890
What if he won't let
me get in the car?

650
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:47,090
It's a chance we'll
just have to take.

651
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:31,580
You got 11 minutes.

652
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:36,220
Doris.

653
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:55,040
Damn it.

654
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:30,010
I can't fix the car
with you starting it.

655
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,740
This
is Dick Woods bringing you

656
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:35,160
music from Dodger
Stadium as we do

657
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:37,480
every Sunday preceding
the ball game.

658
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:40,730
Talking about baseball,
those red hot Cincinnati Reds

659
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:43,840
are in town, riding a
nine-game winning streak.

660
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:46,950
It's going to be Bob
Purkey going for the Reds

661
01:04:47,050 --> 01:04:48,670
and Sandy Koufax
for the Dodgers.

662
01:04:48,770 --> 01:04:51,570
It should be quite
a pitchers' battle.

663
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:53,700
There's still plenty of
good seats to be had,

664
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:57,050
so if you're not doing anything,
come out to Dodger Stadium

665
01:04:57,150 --> 01:05:01,291
and see exciting
National League baseball.

666
01:05:01,391 --> 01:05:04,155
It's a beautiful
day for a ball game.

667
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:07,228
Time is 1:10, still
time to come on down.

668
01:05:07,328 --> 01:05:10,301
And now stay tuned
for Dodger warm-ups.

669
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:21,810
If we could just get them away
from the car long enough to--

670
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:24,600
Music.

671
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:33,020
All those people laughing
and yelling, so happy.

672
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:41,251
Oh Ed, I don't want to die.

673
01:05:41,351 --> 01:05:43,740
I don't want to die.

674
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:45,340
You're
not going to die, Doris.

675
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,681
Four minutes.

676
01:06:12,231 --> 01:06:13,300
Doris, get in the
car and start it

677
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,260
so I can see if the
pump holds pressure.

678
01:06:17,450 --> 01:06:21,121
Doris, get the car and start it.

679
01:06:21,221 --> 01:06:23,001
Just a minute.

680
01:06:23,101 --> 01:06:23,960
You want the car to run.

681
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:27,445
I want to live those
extra few minutes.

682
01:06:27,545 --> 01:06:30,930
Now I have to check
the pump for pressure.

683
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:33,160
All right.

684
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:35,030
But it better run good.

685
01:07:24,091 --> 01:07:25,330
Start it up.

686
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:39,350
You ain't got much more time.

687
01:07:42,910 --> 01:07:44,110
Two minutes.

688
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:49,081
How does it feel when
you're about to die?

689
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:55,050
Try it now.

690
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,570
I think you're yellow belly.

691
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:16,961
Yeah.

692
01:08:17,061 --> 01:08:18,550
One of them squirmers.

693
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:53,670
Get out.

694
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:59,150
I said get out!

695
01:10:05,031 --> 01:10:06,230
Move.

696
01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:26,710
You must think I'm stupid.

697
01:10:26,810 --> 01:10:28,270
You trying something?

698
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:46,590
You did something.

699
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:48,250
I did nothing.

700
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:49,880
It was running pretty
good a few seconds ago.

701
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:50,920
You must have did something.

702
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:52,490
Look, this pump has
been in a wrecked car

703
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:53,500
for who knows how long.

704
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:55,850
Now sometimes they get clogged
and don't hold a pressure.

705
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:57,330
I should take it
out and clean it.

706
01:10:57,430 --> 01:10:58,675
You ain't got time for that.

707
01:10:58,775 --> 01:11:00,483
It's not holding pressure.

708
01:11:00,583 --> 01:11:02,191
It needs to be cleaned.

709
01:11:02,291 --> 01:11:04,350
You're out of time, ain'tcha?

710
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:06,410
It won't take very long.

711
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:08,870
You ain't taking nothing out!

712
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:11,250
You think you're
fooling me, don't you?

713
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:14,920
Think I don't know nothing
about cars, don't you?

714
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:18,025
That thing right there,
that's a carburetor.

715
01:11:18,125 --> 01:11:21,131
The car can't run unless
there's gas in it.

716
01:11:21,231 --> 01:11:23,870
All you gotta do is prime it.

717
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:26,840
Now, I seen that
done, so you prime it.

718
01:11:29,221 --> 01:11:29,820
Well, go on.

719
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,420
There's a gas pump over there.

720
01:12:00,910 --> 01:12:03,211
Doris, get in the car and
start it when I tell you to.

721
01:12:03,311 --> 01:12:06,420
Nobody gets in that car but me.

722
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:07,790
Well, if I'm going
prime it, somebody

723
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:08,990
has to pump the gas pedal.

724
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:10,011
Just never you mind.

725
01:12:10,111 --> 01:12:11,760
You just put that gas
in that carburetor.

726
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:11,020
Charlie!

727
01:13:16,001 --> 01:13:18,490
Oh my god, Judy!

728
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:32,220
Judy, no.

729
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:35,195
Judy.

730
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:44,121
Judy, Judy, Judy.

731
01:14:17,330 --> 01:14:19,810
I
know you're hiding!

732
01:14:19,910 --> 01:14:21,625
I'll find you.

733
01:14:21,725 --> 01:14:23,097
I'll find you.

734
01:14:23,197 --> 01:14:25,070
I'll kill you!

735
01:17:55,190 --> 01:17:58,135
Doris, run!

736
01:30:31,030 --> 01:30:32,400
Purkey's out again.

737
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:35,520
Gets the sign,
wind up once more.

738
01:30:35,620 --> 01:30:36,850
Ball low, outside.

739
01:30:36,950 --> 01:30:42,220
A curveball just missed the
outside corner, Fairly swung.

740
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:44,560
Ball one, strike one to Fairly.

741
01:30:44,660 --> 01:30:47,520
Say, incidently, there are lots
of good seats here for you fans

742
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:48,930
to enjoy the Dodgers
and the Redlegs.

743
01:30:49,030 --> 01:30:51,170
If you're close by,
won't you come on down?

744
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:54,190
You'll enjoy it here at Dodger
Stadium, a gorgeous day.

745
01:30:54,290 --> 01:30:57,210
Shirtsleeved crowd, everybody
having a wonderful time.

746
01:30:57,310 --> 01:30:58,850
OK, we're set to go.

747
01:30:58,950 --> 01:31:01,520
The bases loaded, bottom
of the first inning,

748
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:05,260
Ron Fairly up there, Purkey the
great pitcher of the Redlegs

749
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:06,065
set to go.

750
01:31:06,165 --> 01:31:07,027
He faces in.

751
01:31:07,127 --> 01:31:07,890
He has his sign.

752
01:31:07,990 --> 01:31:09,430
There's the wind up, the pitch.

753
01:31:10,130 --> 01:31:11,230
Fairly belts it.

754
01:31:11,330 --> 01:31:12,180
Oh, what a smash.

755
01:31:13,130 --> 01:31:14,300
SPORTCASTER (ON
Frank Robinson

756
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:16,731
is He's going
back. races

757
01:31:16,831 --> 01:31:17,830
towards the wall.

758
01:31:17,930 --> 01:31:19,731
Back, back, back, he goes.

759
01:31:19,831 --> 01:31:21,680
Oh, it's a home run!
