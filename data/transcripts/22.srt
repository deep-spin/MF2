00:01:55,582 --> 00:01:56,804
Hi Frankie.

2
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,378
Hello.

3
00:02:07,896 --> 00:02:09,500
Get in here.

4
00:02:29,928 --> 00:02:32,536
Nothing like that first drink of the day

5
00:02:34,608 --> 00:02:37,401
Go on, drink up! Enjoy

6
00:02:38,214 --> 00:02:42,139
They tell me, you're quite a dancer?
No? Well
how about a dance anyway?

7
00:03:07,893 --> 00:03:11,221
Hey give them back. What's the big idea?

8
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,755
Frankie...

9
00:03:15,335 --> 00:03:18,019
Frankie, when did you get back? How are you?

10
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:20,429
You all right? You know.....

11
00:03:21,512 --> 00:03:24,304
- The monkey is gone.
- Let me look at you.

12
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:30,171
- Not even a postie card.
- You can't read anyway.

13
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,219
- You're good at drawing pictures.
-Oh, you goof-ball.

14
00:03:34,764 --> 00:03:36,138
How's the lost dog business?

15
00:03:36,797 --> 00:03:40,048
As soon as they see me walking around, people start
locking up their mutts.

16
00:03:40,365 --> 00:03:44,161
l tell you folks just don't have that trust in their fellow
man anymore.

17
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,607
- Hey Antic, look who's out.
- Frankie!

18
00:03:50,952 --> 00:03:55,131
- You all right? Good kid.
- Enough already, buy me a drink.

19
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:58,860
- Look what the cat dragged in.
- Frankie!

20
00:03:59,251 --> 00:04:01,204
You've been gone so long, l thought maybe you'd
been made warden.

21
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,074
- Well you're looking good.
- Put on 6 pounds.

22
00:04:04,353 --> 00:04:04,964
6 pounds!

23
00:04:05,274 --> 00:04:07,532
He's been gone so long, l thought maybe he'd been
made warden.

24
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:10,752
- How was it down there Frankie?
- Greatest place you've ever seen.

25
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,318
l'm telling ya, ball games, great food. l even learned
how to play the drums.

26
00:04:16,552 --> 00:04:20,534
You make it sound as if l missed something by not
going to jail years ago. lt's a prison, no?

27
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:23,731
More of a hospital kind. Let me show you something.

28
00:04:24,007 --> 00:04:26,800
Ah, Federal Pens is always best. Ask anybody.

29
00:04:27,613 --> 00:04:30,406
He's been gone so long, l think he's been made
warden.

30
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,202
Ever see anything so pretty.

31
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:36,617
- Don't touch!
- Hey, how'd you sneak them out Frankie?

32
00:04:36,858 --> 00:04:39,651
- Them guys gave them to me in the band.
-They let you have a band?

33
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:42,720
Yeah, l was in it. They chipped in and bought me
these when l left.

34
00:04:44,262 --> 00:04:48,262
Long time. How was it there? Bad?

35
00:04:51,717 --> 00:04:56,005
- lt wasn't bad.
- Six months. You could hardly wait, l bet?

36
00:04:58,468 --> 00:05:02,909
- Come over to my place
- No thanks.

37
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:06,210
You broke? Now ain't you being stupid? lt's for free.

38
00:05:07,023 --> 00:05:09,478
l don't need it, that's all. l kicked it.

39
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,207
Oh, kicked it?

40
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,150
- One of them.
- l mean it.

41
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,846
Sure

42
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:23,408
l'll be around.

43
00:05:28,096 --> 00:05:31,816
Frankie, don't do it. Don't start up with that peddlar
again.

44
00:05:33,505 --> 00:05:35,644
l'd rather chop my arm off, before l'd let him touch it.

45
00:05:36,766 --> 00:05:41,530
this Dr. Lennick who took care of me down at the
hospital, real good guy he told me at least 10
times........

46
00:05:41,957 --> 00:05:45,939
He told me Frankie, you get out of here and take one
fix, you're hooked again.

47
00:05:48,555 --> 00:05:50,159
Don't worry about me buddy boy

48
00:05:52,775 --> 00:05:54,423
Let's get out of here. Thanks Antic.

49
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:59,210
Take care of the dog for me. l've got a customer
coming to get it.

50
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:11,432
- Don't let him give you no gas.
- Him? l ain't going to be around here long enough to
let him bother me.

51
00:06:11,432 --> 00:06:12,429
- Don't let him give you no gas.
- Him? l ain't going to be around here long enough to
let him bother me.

52
00:06:12,429 --> 00:06:15,909
- l'm going to get me a job in a big-name band.
- You're kidding?

53
00:06:16,457 --> 00:06:21,443
What do you think l stretching my wrist for buddy-o?
The guy that teaches drumming down there, says l'm
a natural.

54
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:24,200
l can't miss he says. Arm's made of pure gold.

55
00:06:24,513 --> 00:06:26,116
You mean a job winding these drums?

56
00:06:26,584 --> 00:06:34,415
- l've got everything planned too. Going to call myself
Jack Duvall.
- Probably l ain't going to see you around so much
then, huh?

57
00:06:35,382 --> 00:06:38,448
Maybe l can set something up for you. Carrying the
instruments or something.

58
00:06:39,448 --> 00:06:43,965
- Travelling around the country high-type night clubs.
- How does that sound to you? When is it going to
be, when??

59
00:06:44,397 --> 00:06:49,383
Right away, today. l'm the kind of guy boy that when
l move, watch my smoke. But l'm going to need
some good clothes.

60
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:53,921
- Well you go on up. l'm going to find you some.
- Yeah, yeah, size 39.

61
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,376
- 39.
- Stripes.

62
00:06:55,688 --> 00:06:57,062
Something nice.

63
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:09,880
You stop that noise! You and your husband or l throw
you both out.

64
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:16,280
Who is landlord? Me! You do as l say.

65
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:19,491
Your mother's eye socks, l do like you say!

66
00:07:20,764 --> 00:07:23,557
Frankie...

67
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,892
You look great! How're ya feeling Frankie? l mean....

68
00:07:28,398 --> 00:07:34,650
- Fine, fine, just fine. Hi ya landlord.
- She and husband fight all the time. Hollerthrow
things!

69
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,669
- Nothing changes.
- This is respectable house, and l am respectable
man!

70
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:42,942
Respectable my eye! Go on get out, you're late for
the parole board.

71
00:08:05,814 --> 00:08:08,123
Frankie...

72
00:08:14,151 --> 00:08:16,943
You're home.

73
00:08:18,677 --> 00:08:21,470
Oh Frankie, l love you so much!

74
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:27,531
l've missed you so.

75
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:36,904
l've been so lonely Frankie, without you.

76
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:40,395
- l've been so lonely without you.
- Sssh, stop crying.

77
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,042
Let me look at you.

78
00:08:44,814 --> 00:08:47,607
- My eyes are going to be all red.
- No, you look fine.

79
00:08:49,878 --> 00:08:53,358
- ls the cold sore gone?
- Yeah, you look real good.

80
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:09,092
l've had this cold sore, and l wanted to look real nice
for you when you came back. l was afraid that it
wouldn't be gone, so l put this cream on.

81
00:09:12,364 --> 00:09:15,156
Everything is going to be all right..

82
00:09:17,082 --> 00:09:24,574
Oh, you didn't see. Look, V got the cake by the
bakery, but the sign l made. Sort of like a welcome
home.

83
00:09:28,258 --> 00:09:30,091
Gee, it's like a real party or something.

84
00:09:32,094 --> 00:09:34,047
Real nice.

85
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,802
- How are you Frankie?
- l'm clean.

86
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,764
Sure?

87
00:09:40,687 --> 00:09:43,480
- l kicked it for keeps.
- Did it hurt?

88
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,861
How was it there for you?

89
00:09:47,309 --> 00:09:51,395
They treated me fine down there. There was this
doctor, Dr. Lennex, he was real good to me.

90
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:58,030
Frankie! Did you miss me?

91
00:09:59,343 --> 00:10:02,518
Of course l missed you. What kind of silly question is
that?

92
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:07,543
Of course l missed you. Honest, no kidding.

93
00:10:09,701 --> 00:10:13,385
- What have you got there?
- You'll see. Oh, l brought you something.

94
00:10:17,846 --> 00:10:22,363
- Oh, it an exquisite thing.
- You like it? l made it myself, out of cigarette
wrappers.

95
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:27,314
lt's just an exquisite thing, that's all.
-You made it? Yeah.

96
00:10:27,744 --> 00:10:32,839
Yeah, for a hobby like. You see part of the cure, was
to keep yourself busy, doing things you enjoy

97
00:10:33,805 --> 00:10:38,493
Like for instance, l wanted to learn to drum and
music. And Dr. Lennex got them to help me do it.

98
00:10:40,838 --> 00:10:46,130
During the day I was kept busy enough, butduring the
night I'd get restless and I wanted to keep my mInd of
the craving.

99
00:10:46,784 --> 00:10:48,616
l made that.

100
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:52,492
- There's something important l've got to tell you.
- What?

101
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,252
l forget right now.

102
00:10:57,141 --> 00:10:58,406
A whistle?

103
00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:03,626
l was scared sometimes being alone. So Vi got it for
me and l should blow for her when l wanted her

104
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:06,544
Go on, you were telling me.

105
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:11,110
The first thing you do when you get there, is you talk
to a doctor for about 2 hours..

106
00:11:11,693 --> 00:11:13,952
l know! l know what it is. l know what l wanted to tell
you.

107
00:11:14,263 --> 00:11:17,788
Vi took me to this movie and the girl's kid brother had
a friend and who do you think he looked like?

108
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:20,170
- Who?
- You!

109
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:28,622
That was a good movie. Stage show was real good
too. We owe Vi 80 cents for the movie, l was broke.
We owe her for the cake too.

110
00:11:30,311 --> 00:11:33,944
How come you didn't have any money? Swrick didn't
kick in regualr?

111
00:11:34,377 --> 00:11:36,908
- No.
- Well, he was suppose to.

112
00:11:37,983 --> 00:11:40,776
lt was his joint they raided, not mine. l was just the
dealer.

113
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,805
l kept my mouth shut and took the rap.

114
00:11:46,691 --> 00:11:50,444
- lf he didn't send 50 a month regular, how much did
he?
- Well he sent 50, but not regular

115
00:11:51,218 --> 00:11:53,298
See Vi had to kick in for me sometimes.

116
00:11:56,525 --> 00:11:59,471
She took good care of you? You had fun with her?

117
00:12:00,246 --> 00:12:03,038
Yeah.....but not like when you're here.

118
00:12:04,312 --> 00:12:10,749
lt was terrible being alone Frankie...and my legs when
they hurt, she don't massage like you.

119
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:17,726
- What do they say by the clinic?
- l stopped going by that goofy clinic.

120
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:22,577
The clinic must know what right. You got to start the
clinic again. You got to get well.

121
00:12:23,582 --> 00:12:29,212
Vi dreamed that this new doctor around the corner, he
cured me. l'd have gone to him already, but he ain't
free like the clinic.

122
00:12:30,104 --> 00:12:32,896
But now you're back making money again, and l'll go.

123
00:12:34,132 --> 00:12:36,924
l'm finished with Shrika. l won't deal for him no more.

124
00:12:37,968 --> 00:12:41,601
But you always deal. You're a dealer. You're the best
dealer in the business.

125
00:12:42,124 --> 00:12:44,453
No more. l'm a drummer now..

126
00:12:46,688 --> 00:12:51,555
- Don't make jokes Frankie. l never know when
you're making jokes.
- Who's joking? Listen.

127
00:12:57,813 --> 00:12:59,843
Nice huh?

128
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:05,365
lt's Dr. Lennex. l told him my whole life story from
when l was born, almost.

129
00:13:05,908 --> 00:13:14,087
And about you and me. But he told me that if l lived
when l got out, like l lived before l went in there,
chances are l would be hooked again in no time...

130
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:18,956
So that's why l want to get with a band.

131
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:21,372
Listen.

132
00:13:26,175 --> 00:13:28,968
- How's that?
- Cute.

133
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:36,150
- What did you tell him about me, this doctor?
- l told him about getting some money and getting
you well.

134
00:13:37,696 --> 00:13:40,107
Then he said getting with a band was a good way to
go at it.

135
00:13:40,957 --> 00:13:43,750
He even gave me the name of a guy right here in
town, to get a job.

136
00:13:45,944 --> 00:13:50,047
l mean with this man, if he's ever heard of this great
doctor. Most time these things just don't come
through.

137
00:13:52,005 --> 00:13:54,035
- l got this.
- What is it?

138
00:13:54,345 --> 00:13:56,178
lt's a letter from the Doc.

139
00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:00,371
- l think l'll go call him now
- Now? Let's talk about it tomorrow.

140
00:14:00,918 --> 00:14:04,092
- You'll be all right.
- You've haven't even tasted the cake yet.

141
00:14:05,176 --> 00:14:05,790
- l'll only be a minute.
- l'll be right up. No, now Frankie.

142
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:13,500
- l'll only be a minute.
- l'll be right up. No, now Frankie.

143
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,482
First, taste a piece of nice....cake.

144
00:14:24,484 --> 00:14:26,972
- Hey, you coming baby?
- Yeah, l'm coming John.

145
00:14:33,921 --> 00:14:36,714
- Molly!
- Yeah, l'm coming John.

146
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:43,682
l want to talk to Mr. Harry Lane, please.

147
00:14:44,071 --> 00:14:46,610
- How about it huh?
- Machine, Mr. Franke Machine.

148
00:14:47,045 --> 00:14:49,868
Yeah, l've got a letter of introduction for him. From Dr
Lennex.

149
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:55,505
- Hello Frankie.
- Dr. Martin Lennex.

150
00:14:57,165 --> 00:14:59,303
- How have you been Molly?
- Okay.

151
00:14:59,658 --> 00:15:02,451
Come on baby, let's go.

152
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:05,633
A guy l met while you was away.

153
00:15:06,717 --> 00:15:10,590
- Mr. Lane. l've got a letter for you.
- Come on, what do you say kiddo?

154
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:15,244
This afternoon huh? Well l sure do appreciate it Mr.
Lane, thank you very much.

155
00:15:16,473 --> 00:15:19,266
Okay, good-bye.

156
00:15:20,501 --> 00:15:26,709
Frankie! A new thing, by Brax Department Store. No
sales girls, you just help yourself.

157
00:15:27,368 --> 00:15:29,659
lt's what they call an honor system.

158
00:15:30,283 --> 00:15:35,608
What's the matter Frankie? Feel that material. And l
figured, as long as l'm there....

159
00:15:37,724 --> 00:15:39,571
Nice huh?

160
00:15:40,232 --> 00:15:42,839
You all right? Frankie?

161
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:46,440
- l got the drummerjob.
-Already? Wow!

162
00:15:46,753 --> 00:15:48,706
When l move, l move like a streak.

163
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,759
Think it looks all right?

164
00:15:57,226 --> 00:16:00,019
How come you ask me all of a sudden?

165
00:16:01,024 --> 00:16:05,482
- l just want to know if it looks all right Sash?
-And my name ain't Sash, it's Sophia.

166
00:16:08,709 --> 00:16:10,127
What's the matter?

167
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:13,915
Nothing's the matter, 'cept how would you feel if your
spine was hurting?

168
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:22,019
- Why didn't you say so?
- On account of it being your first day back, and l
didn't want you to worry.

169
00:16:22,557 --> 00:16:28,157
- Don't be like that Sash.
- ls it bad? Maybe the new doctor will do me some
good huh?

170
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,922
- We'll go see him when l get back.
- Oh, take me now Frankie.

171
00:16:33,388 --> 00:16:36,181
Sash, l've got this appointment. You know how much
it means to me..

172
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,831
We'll go as soon as l get back.

173
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:42,280
- Please Frankie.
- l'll hurry.

174
00:16:42,863 --> 00:16:49,606
- Well give me a little more massage first then, huh?
- Sash, l'm doing this for you to get some money so
we can get you a good doctor.

175
00:16:50,267 --> 00:16:54,071
- Frankie...
- Look, l'll get you a dog too. Get her a dog, will ya?

176
00:16:54,461 --> 00:16:57,756
l'll give the job my personal attention. Just have
confidence in the management.

177
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,822
Wish me luck Sash.

178
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,609
Frankie!

179
00:17:10,573 --> 00:17:13,366
Wait. Wait Frankie!

180
00:17:45,277 --> 00:17:48,343
- Wishes or wants, what could l do?
- Yeah, she just don't realize.

181
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:52,641
- Shut up punk. Just don't realize. How would you
like to be nailed to a chair?

182
00:18:00,468 --> 00:18:05,793
Frankie, Frankie, how are you? Well, it didn't do you
no harm, did it Frankie?

183
00:18:07,476 --> 00:18:10,981
- You look good.
- That's right Shrika, it was a real country club.

184
00:18:13,562 --> 00:18:17,773
- They give you this when they let you out?
- They didn't give him nothing. l got it at Brax's.

185
00:18:18,434 --> 00:18:22,231
l come as soon as l hear you are out. l figured you
was worried about getting this job again.

186
00:18:22,961 --> 00:18:25,023
Don't worry. Shrika don't forget.

187
00:18:25,723 --> 00:18:28,515
- Job's waiting.
- You need a dealer, you say?

188
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:35,548
Do you? No! l've been dealing myself and l've built
up a game like nobody's business. l've got a great
following. The play is bigger than ever.

189
00:18:36,553 --> 00:18:39,041
- l hear that you wasn't doing so good.
- From who?

190
00:18:39,354 --> 00:18:42,146
When l say ''great'', l don't mean a lot, a few..loaded.

191
00:18:43,075 --> 00:18:47,024
- So, what do you want me for?
- Like l'm telling you. l take care of my friends.

192
00:18:47,908 --> 00:18:50,701
Can l polish your halo Shrika, only a quareter

193
00:18:51,745 --> 00:18:58,536
Look, l've been doing all right. But l don't say the
customers like me better than they like you. The
dealer makes the house.

194
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,493
- What do you say?
- No!

195
00:19:02,805 --> 00:19:07,552
- You're dealing for some otherjoint?
- l ain't dealing for nobody l ain't dealing for nobody
no more!

196
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:15,995
ls that the way you re-pay me? Didn't l send money
to Sash? Here, l've gone and told all my friends that
you'd be working for me again.

197
00:19:16,385 --> 00:19:19,178
What am l suppose to do? As far as l'm concerned,
you can go back to matching pennies with school
kids.

198
00:19:26,449 --> 00:19:28,172
Who is he?

199
00:19:34,313 --> 00:19:37,608
- ls that a thing with them?
- They see each other. You want to meet him?

200
00:19:38,955 --> 00:19:41,289
- See ya Frankie.

201
00:19:45,246 --> 00:19:46,983
Hey you...

202
00:19:50,361 --> 00:19:53,153
- Get in dealer.
- Who me? What for?

203
00:19:53,621 --> 00:19:55,531
- You too punk.
- l didn't do nothing.

204
00:19:56,077 --> 00:19:59,372
Now wait, listen. l'm on my way to get a job. lt's
important to me.

205
00:19:59,913 --> 00:20:04,430
- You can pick me up some other time.
- l just need an hour

206
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:18,216
Are you looking at being sued for liable or something.
l could sue you right now

207
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:24,510
- You're looking good Dealer, real good.
- When did they let you out? Monday

208
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:28,535
- What's the charge?
- Shop lifting from Brax, this suit.

209
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:31,758
- Who told you a thing like that?
- A little birdie.

210
00:20:32,226 --> 00:20:35,019
-A little bird with a cigar.
- Shrika.

211
00:20:35,717 --> 00:20:38,554
ls that all you could stay out of trouble, two days,
dealer?

212
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:44,890
Listen, l got a chance at a job, playing with a band.
Honest, if you don't believe me, call the guy on the
phone, he'll tell you..

213
00:20:45,665 --> 00:20:49,189
- Just give me half hour, please.
-Sure, you can have my badge too.

214
00:20:49,578 --> 00:20:53,211
- Book them and hold these two.
- Look, all l need is a half hour Give me a break, will
ya?

215
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:56,013
l don't make the rules dealer.

216
00:21:02,334 --> 00:21:10,265
You can't hold me. l'm incapable. l ain't smart
enough to be running around loose, but l'm too goofy
to be locked up.

217
00:21:10,766 --> 00:21:13,559
- Let go of the neck.
- Let go of the neck. l've got a complaint.

218
00:21:14,027 --> 00:21:15,979
Let go of the neck.

219
00:21:16,005 --> 00:21:17,958
Hey you, l'm talking to you.

220
00:21:19,535 --> 00:21:23,746
Oh the old silent treatment huh. Let's have your
number fella..

221
00:21:40,765 --> 00:21:42,903
Frankie, you got a cigarette?

222
00:21:47,171 --> 00:21:51,239
Do a cigarette trick, you knowjust to break the dirty
monotomy.

223
00:22:21,223 --> 00:22:26,548
Hello dealer. l come running as soon as l heard. You
want l should get you out dealer?

224
00:22:26,939 --> 00:22:34,719
The store will drop the charges, but 37 bucks is a lot
of dough. How do l know you'd pay me back?

225
00:22:35,378 --> 00:22:39,131
- You fink!
- lt'd be different if you was dealing for me.

226
00:22:40,787 --> 00:22:44,559
- lf you want to deal for me, l can get you out.
- You dirty lousy, stool pigeon.

227
00:22:45,212 --> 00:22:46,815
l don't know what you mean.

228
00:22:48,127 --> 00:22:50,309
Just trying to do you a favor.

229
00:22:52,078 --> 00:22:53,911
Yes, or no?

230
00:22:58,715 --> 00:23:00,668
Okay...

231
00:23:04,891 --> 00:23:08,924
He took off like a whipped dog. He's scared of you
Frankie.

232
00:23:11,118 --> 00:23:17,206
- Nobody's ever been scared of me.
-Them Krautz was scared of you. You was a big man
in the army.

233
00:23:17,525 --> 00:23:21,628
Big man. l was the guy that picked the fly spots out of
the pepper.

234
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,923
Get me out!

235
00:23:39,288 --> 00:23:42,081
Can you get me a fix?

236
00:23:57,503 --> 00:24:02,733
- Big Ace's and here we go down and dirty
- Better luck next time.

237
00:24:07,262 --> 00:24:10,055
l'll see that. Coffee!

238
00:24:12,441 --> 00:24:15,233
Doesn't mean a thing, unless you have the King. Bet
more, win more.

239
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:22,443
ou still take tips dealer? Or don't they pay in the
music game?

240
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:28,558
What happened to that big job you had lined up?You
stink out the joint? Give us a fresh deck..

241
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:31,820
l decide when we need a fresh deck at this table..

242
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:35,962
- Hey Louie. Borrow me a dirty dollar.
- Get back at the door, lame-brain.

243
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:40,111
- l take orders only from Frankie.
-Don't give me lip you cheap little hustler

244
00:24:41,109 --> 00:24:46,529
Hustler? l'm ligit compared to some. Ain't no 14 year
old junkies waiting around to see me.

245
00:24:48,564 --> 00:24:50,168
Do you want to die?

246
00:24:52,516 --> 00:24:54,468
nd here we go, down and dirty

247
00:25:04,446 --> 00:25:06,475
l'll deal the next one down..

248
00:25:09,586 --> 00:25:13,388
- Sorry.
- What's the sign of when a dealer's hands begin to
shake?

249
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,341
Take over for a while, will ya?

250
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,515
All right men, new deal.

251
00:25:24,598 --> 00:25:26,890
Okay men, here we go, down and dirty

252
00:25:27,514 --> 00:25:29,576
Ace.....seven.....

253
00:25:45,441 --> 00:25:52,915
You know what's eating at you? You showed up the
mob, for kicking it for keeps. So now you're ashamed
to think, well even what you think..

254
00:25:53,459 --> 00:25:54,833
Ain't that right?

255
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:58,247
You know l don't talk about my customers, so who'd
be the wiser?

256
00:25:59,405 --> 00:26:01,684
Why fight it dealer? Who, for what?

257
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,740
Come over to my place. What do you say?

258
00:26:11,156 --> 00:26:13,949
l'll be around.

259
00:27:03,852 --> 00:27:07,377
They told me you was working here, so l was passing
by and thought l'd come in and have a drink..

260
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:11,668
- Well, l've been here awhile.
- Doing any good?

261
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,622
All right. Small cut of the game, usual cut of the
drinks.

262
00:27:15,554 --> 00:27:19,782
- Ain't got all night.
- Right. Have something.

263
00:27:21,127 --> 00:27:23,080
- Fine.
- Two doubles.

264
00:27:23,468 --> 00:27:28,028
- You didn't have to do that Frankie.
- No reason you should be losing money by wasting
your time talking to me.

265
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:30,481
You know you're no waste.

266
00:27:31,255 --> 00:27:32,935
l was hoping you'd come see me.Y

267
00:27:34,631 --> 00:27:38,460
- You know how it is Molly.
- Sure, so busy now.

268
00:27:46,344 --> 00:27:49,136
Here's to it Mollyo.

269
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,973
Mollyo. l haven't heard that since you went away.

270
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,952
- You're looking good Frankie.
- Feel good.

271
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:04,558
- They tell me you're going to be a drummer now
- Yeah!

272
00:28:05,256 --> 00:28:08,088
- l've got an appointment with a man tomorrow.
- Oh, that's swell.

273
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,862
- Probably l won't get the job though.
- Sure you will.

274
00:28:12,174 --> 00:28:14,966
- l don't play good enough.
- l bet you play fine.

275
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:18,304
You were always whistling and drumming on tables
and things. Real good too.

276
00:28:20,345 --> 00:28:23,137
l mean it! You've got a natural rythm.

277
00:28:25,102 --> 00:28:28,582
l was thinking, maybe of taking a stage name. Jack
Duvall.

278
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,645
- Jack Duvall,Yeah, that's real class.
- lt is, ain't it?

279
00:28:33,354 --> 00:28:38,305
- That's a swell name. lt fits you Frankie.
- This guy l'm going to see tomorrow, he books all the
big bands.

280
00:28:39,193 --> 00:28:42,717
- lf l get on with him and wear a tux.
- You look swell in a tux.

281
00:28:43,144 --> 00:28:45,937
- l already got the drums.
- Pardon. l need a buck.

282
00:28:46,597 --> 00:28:48,429
Ante up kid.

283
00:29:00,957 --> 00:29:02,680
l got lonely..

284
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:09,273
l needed somebody and he's a poor beat guy who
needs somebody too.

285
00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:12,232
Everybody needs somebody.

286
00:29:13,884 --> 00:29:16,677
- But you can do better than him.
- Can l Frankie?

287
00:29:22,779 --> 00:29:24,859
Molly l....

288
00:29:27,093 --> 00:29:31,381
l thought a lot about you when l was away About you
and me and Sash.

289
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:37,218
lt would never work out between you and me as long
as she is sitting upstairs in that chair

290
00:29:39,906 --> 00:29:42,699
lt'd be different if she didn't love me, and she wasn't
so helpless.

291
00:29:45,508 --> 00:29:49,432
You can't make a fool of someone if they love you and
they're so helpless.

292
00:29:51,427 --> 00:29:56,064
That's why l didn't come around sooner. And that's
why l ain't coming around no more.

293
00:29:57,258 --> 00:29:58,752
You understand?

294
00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:03,082
Sure......sure l understand..

295
00:30:07,386 --> 00:30:11,027
- You're a good girl Molly.
- ...real good.

296
00:30:15,186 --> 00:30:16,680
Frankie...

297
00:30:21,055 --> 00:30:23,848
Good luck with that fellow tomorrow

298
00:30:32,777 --> 00:30:35,578
You're not the first to come to me with a letter from Dr
Lennex.

299
00:30:36,052 --> 00:30:38,496
- l've taken care of a lot of you people.
-The doctor told me.

300
00:30:38,774 --> 00:30:41,567
l like doing it, you understand. So don't feel that this
is charity, or anything like that.

301
00:30:43,838 --> 00:30:46,784
- Have you played professionally before?
- Only down at Lexinton.

302
00:30:47,329 --> 00:30:52,315
l see, then you wouldn't mind auditioning? l mean l
know some band leaders who might have an opening,
but they'd have to be sure that you can play

303
00:30:52,623 --> 00:30:54,881
- Oh sure, sure.
- Okay...

304
00:30:55,999 --> 00:30:59,173
There's only one thing Frankie. You see......

305
00:31:00,027 --> 00:31:05,293
A good many people like yourself, they mean well, but
they're weak. They let me down.

306
00:31:06,484 --> 00:31:11,580
l mean l go to all this trouble. Vouch for them, and
they go back on the habit.

307
00:31:12,353 --> 00:31:15,528
- lt makes me look bad.
- Oh, l wouldn't honest!

308
00:31:15,844 --> 00:31:20,591
l'm telling you this because, once a man lets me
down, l'm done with him.

309
00:31:21,675 --> 00:31:25,434
Even if he comes back on his knees. And don't think
that some of them haven't.

310
00:31:26,179 --> 00:31:28,269
- l wouldn't let you down Mr. Lane.
- Good!

311
00:31:28,938 --> 00:31:33,117
l'll call you a week from Friday, about noon.Okay?

312
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,260
- l sure do appreciate it.
- Oh, forget it.

313
00:31:37,455 --> 00:31:39,178
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

314
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,725
Do you like my hair better this way, or swept up
Frankie?

315
00:31:52,214 --> 00:31:55,029
Well you could at least tell me. lt ain't my fault he
don't phone.

316
00:31:56,648 --> 00:32:00,128
What did l say? Just don't hold your breath to hear
from that guy, that's what l said.

317
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:06,879
He told you noon. Here it is almost 6 o'clock already
so how do you think he'll phone?

318
00:32:13,489 --> 00:32:17,783
l just don't want you should eat your heart out, is all.
Forget the whole thing Frankie, l bet he has.

319
00:32:17,783 --> 00:32:20,291
l just don't want you should eat your heart out, is all.
Forget the whole thing Frankie, l bet he has.

320
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:25,277
You think he's got nothing better to do than to worry
about you?

321
00:32:26,391 --> 00:32:28,114
Ha!

322
00:32:41,097 --> 00:32:43,263
Excuse me....

323
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:48,876
Hello. Oh, just a minute.

324
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,752
lt's for you.

325
00:32:52,605 --> 00:32:53,979
Hello..

326
00:32:59,356 --> 00:33:02,531
-Are you Dr. Dominaski?
- Yes, l came as soon as l could.

327
00:33:10,762 --> 00:33:12,715
Well, how you feel little lady?

328
00:33:13,371 --> 00:33:18,772
- See, the doctor asks how l'm feelilng.
- We'll have you feeling fine in one, two, three.

329
00:33:20,122 --> 00:33:21,148
What is this?

330
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:26,752
This happens to be an electric blood reverser and
spine manipulator.

331
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,709
- What's the gimmack?
- Gimmack?

332
00:33:30,097 --> 00:33:37,513
lt so happens brother, that l am a member of the
American Association of Medical Psycology,
Hydrology and Divine Healing. Where's the socket?

333
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,994
Cold hands.

334
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:47,402
Poor cirrculation. Eat lots of hot things. Chilies,
peppers, hot sauces.

335
00:33:47,832 --> 00:33:50,625
- Pickles?
- Not more than 3 a day.

336
00:33:53,893 --> 00:33:56,707
Now lean forward, and we'll vibrate the vertabres.

337
00:34:00,542 --> 00:34:05,681
- Know how l got like l am? My spine was hurt. Oh l
can see that. Your ligaments and vertabres are
locked together.

338
00:34:06,642 --> 00:34:09,937
ln a car accident it was hurt. Three years ago, May
11th.

339
00:34:10,785 --> 00:34:13,076
Maybe you read about it in the papers huh?

340
00:34:17,652 --> 00:34:23,907
This is the car that it happened in. That's me, laying
there. My husband was the one driving the car and
he was drunk.

341
00:34:24,224 --> 00:34:29,320
- Drunk?
- He got me in this accident and smashed me up
good, so that l can't walk anymore or dance anymore.

342
00:34:29,748 --> 00:34:32,541
-And he married me right here, in the hospital chapel.
- Sash!

343
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:47,603
- Feeling a little better?
- Yeah, much better.

344
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:09,053
Hey Frankie, guess what? l got that dog for Sash.

345
00:35:10,533 --> 00:35:15,129
Free spirit! Every claw and hair on him is a
champion. Champion of what?

346
00:35:15,786 --> 00:35:18,579
He brings back empties. Here, l'll show you.

347
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:26,402
He's all dog. You can make money out of him
Frankie.

348
00:35:28,021 --> 00:35:30,814
What he's really good at, is catching those squirrels in
the park, and shaking the peanuts out of them.

349
00:35:31,972 --> 00:35:37,035
Only thing he is trained to chase is a certain kind of
squirrels and they're getting kind of rare in Chicago,
because of the climate changing. You know what l
mean?

350
00:35:39,274 --> 00:35:42,721
So he's just hanging around, waiting for the climate to
change back a little.

351
00:35:43,455 --> 00:35:46,783
He's got a real fighting heart. He's dizzy, but he still in
there trying.

352
00:35:54,733 --> 00:35:58,567
- Take the dog up to Sash.
- Frankie! You're not going with him!

353
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:00,507
No!

354
00:36:12,085 --> 00:36:14,300
ln a minute dealer.

355
00:37:18,565 --> 00:37:23,434
- Five bucks.
- Last time, it was two.

356
00:37:24,975 --> 00:37:27,767
lt was more than 6 months ago, before you went
away..

357
00:37:29,003 --> 00:37:31,795
They keep raising the price on me.

358
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:43,045
lf they keep doing that, l'll have to find something to
take its place.

359
00:37:45,587 --> 00:37:50,301
The monkey's never dead dealer. The monkey never
dies.

360
00:37:52,569 --> 00:37:57,555
When you kick him off, he just hides in a corner,
waiting his turn.

361
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:25,027
The monkey will die waiting. He ain't climbing up on
my back no more.

362
00:38:27,031 --> 00:38:29,829
Never again. l mean it.

363
00:38:31,544 --> 00:38:34,363
Sure.....

364
00:38:43,616 --> 00:38:48,023
Look Frankie! Look how he drinks it. lt's so cute.

365
00:38:50,482 --> 00:38:53,275
He's got a thirst like a bar-fly.

366
00:38:55,327 --> 00:38:56,837
Hello.....

367
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:02,574
You still expecting that connection to call? For you
own piece of mind, forget him.

368
00:39:04,689 --> 00:39:07,481
The Doc said that l could count on Mr Lane, and the
Doc doesn't lie.

369
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:11,890
The Doc. Look at me, a doc told you l'd be up and
around in no time, and am l?

370
00:39:14,931 --> 00:39:18,106
Have you seen my sticks? Have you seen my
drumsticks anywhere?

371
00:39:19,189 --> 00:39:23,412
You know what l'm going to get for this little dog? A
little rain coat, like for when it rains.

372
00:39:24,189 --> 00:39:26,982
Plaid maybe, or maybe all yellow

373
00:39:27,795 --> 00:39:29,398
Where are my drumsticks, Sash?

374
00:39:32,168 --> 00:39:34,961
- How'd they get up here?
- You liked that, didn't you?

375
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:38,723
- Sash, l never keep them up here.
- You drank it all up didn't you?

376
00:39:39,035 --> 00:39:40,638
Sash!

377
00:39:46,112 --> 00:39:50,705
I put them there. I stood right up and I putthem there,
aII right?

378
00:39:51,093 --> 00:39:55,653
- No kidding?
- Maybe Vi, when she was straightening up for me. l
don't know. Stop picking on me.

379
00:40:04,251 --> 00:40:05,975
Frankie...

380
00:40:06,284 --> 00:40:09,077
You can't keep stoning yourself about it..

381
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,989
There must be a million drummers that play better
than you, who can't getjobs.

382
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:16,037
Just remember that and you're going to feel better

383
00:40:17,345 --> 00:40:19,298
Yeah sure, l will.

384
00:40:23,214 --> 00:40:25,124
Can the noise.

385
00:40:37,867 --> 00:40:40,674
- What's this for Sash?
- What?

386
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:46,658
Oh Vi. She laid it out for groceries. We owe her even
more.

387
00:40:48,661 --> 00:40:51,072
- You got any?
- No.

388
00:40:52,612 --> 00:40:54,751
l don't know what we're doing with all our money

389
00:41:00,256 --> 00:41:03,078
Don't you get enough cards by Shrika?

390
00:41:03,434 --> 00:41:07,316
- l just do it to kill passtime, that's all.
- Well, what about my passtime?

391
00:41:09,849 --> 00:41:13,723
- What did you say this was for?
- l sit here all the time and you don't even talk to me.

392
00:41:16,255 --> 00:41:19,048
We got any more beer? l'd like some.

393
00:41:20,207 --> 00:41:24,156
Beer bloats Sash, when you can't exercise. Here pick
a card.

394
00:41:25,164 --> 00:41:28,725
Nothing is good for me. l am only 25 and it's like l'm
an old lady already.

395
00:41:29,349 --> 00:41:34,096
- ls it my fault l can't exercise?
- Do you want to pick a card, or don't you want to pick
a card?

396
00:41:34,643 --> 00:41:38,702
No, I don'twantto pick a card. AlI I want isjust, isjust
a Iittle....

397
00:41:40,704 --> 00:41:43,497
-A little what Sash?
- Oh, just a little.....

398
00:41:45,653 --> 00:41:47,835
A little beer, a little fun, a little anything.

399
00:41:48,453 --> 00:41:51,266
l can't dance anymore, l can't swim and l can't even
drink beer.

400
00:41:52,204 --> 00:41:57,779
l don't even know what kinds they got anymore. What
other kinds they got these days Frankie?

401
00:42:00,665 --> 00:42:04,953
All right! Pretend l ain't here. You're wishing all the
time that l'd have gotten killed that night.

402
00:42:05,844 --> 00:42:07,873
l don't wish any such thing.

403
00:42:09,642 --> 00:42:12,434
lf l don't talk, you get mad. lf l say anything, you bite
my head off..

404
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:15,906
l don't know whether l'm coming or going Sash.

405
00:42:19,397 --> 00:42:20,969
l told you, it gives me headaches.

406
00:42:21,853 --> 00:42:25,486
Well, l've got to practice sometime Sash. lf the job
comes along, l want to be ready.

407
00:42:26,227 --> 00:42:30,208
The job, the job! Take it to your girlfriend if you're
going to practice.

408
00:42:38,272 --> 00:42:40,002
What?

409
00:42:40,548 --> 00:42:42,708
Take them down and give her the headache.

410
00:42:47,108 --> 00:42:49,901
Do you know what you're saying Sash? Do you know
wht you are talking about?

411
00:42:50,791 --> 00:42:55,657
- Don't give me that innocent look.
- l haven't said two words to her since l come back.

412
00:42:56,775 --> 00:43:00,834
- Just cause l sit here, you don't think l know what
goes on?
- Not two words.

413
00:43:01,609 --> 00:43:03,409
l know plenty.

414
00:43:08,362 --> 00:43:10,784
Cut it out will ya Sash.

415
00:43:11,212 --> 00:43:15,041
Take them down to that tramp if you want to make
noise. Take them down to her, why don't you?

416
00:43:18,385 --> 00:43:19,760
All right, l will.

417
00:43:28,743 --> 00:43:31,602
Frankie.....Frankie, l didn't mean.....

418
00:43:39,804 --> 00:43:44,790
- l have 12 cents to a beer. lf l had 15, l'd be all right.
- l've got 6 cents, here ya go.

419
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:50,192
l ain't going to stand it much longer The heartaches
my old man gives me.

420
00:43:51,274 --> 00:43:58,868
You know what he likes to do most? Tear the dates
off the calendar, watching him. That's suppose to be
my big Saturday night pleasure.

421
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:04,856
Sometimes he loses all control and tears off the whole
week at once. He'll eat them like a billygoat.

422
00:44:05,941 --> 00:44:08,581
- Know what would fill up that empty spot in your life?
- What?

423
00:44:08,971 --> 00:44:14,983
A dog. Ask a satisfied customer. Frankie that dog l
got you, it makes a big difference in your life, doesn't
it.

424
00:44:15,377 --> 00:44:16,752
Yeah.

425
00:44:19,214 --> 00:44:20,248
l want to see.

426
00:44:22,272 --> 00:44:25,088
- l want to see you.
-After the inning.

427
00:44:43,432 --> 00:44:45,165
Hi Frankie.

428
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,382
- You make out all right with the fellow with the job?
- The drumming job? Yeah, fine, fine.

429
00:44:52,268 --> 00:44:55,061
Well not so fine. He sort of tapped out on me.

430
00:44:56,526 --> 00:44:58,359
He promised to call me, but..

431
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:00,624
lt's too bad.

432
00:45:01,015 --> 00:45:03,807
There's a million drummers in the world and how do l
rate?

433
00:45:04,851 --> 00:45:06,454
Maybe he lost your number?

434
00:45:06,884 --> 00:45:08,258
lt happens.

435
00:45:09,032 --> 00:45:11,541
Maybe he just wishing you'd keep in touch.

436
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:15,060
He'd think l was a pest.

437
00:45:15,912 --> 00:45:19,207
Why should he? A good drummer, that's something
that don't turn up everyday

438
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,693
Come on Frankie, call him.

439
00:45:25,042 --> 00:45:26,307
Call him Frankie.

440
00:45:40,706 --> 00:45:43,499
Come on Molly, watch the game huh?

441
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:47,716
Oh l don't feel like it Johnnie. Why don't you go
ahead, l'll wait for you.

442
00:45:54,439 --> 00:45:58,389
Yes studio B, Monday morning, thank you Mr Lane.

443
00:46:01,093 --> 00:46:05,186
Monday! l got an audition Monday Me! He told me
to join the union and get ready to work.

444
00:46:05,615 --> 00:46:09,140
- Oh that's wonderful.
- You know, he did lose my phone number

445
00:46:09,528 --> 00:46:12,932
He was trying to find me all week long. Here l was
ready to forget the whole thing. Gee, if you hadn't
opened your mouth, l wouldn't have called him.

446
00:46:13,364 --> 00:46:16,157
- Sure you would have.
- l've got an audition with a big band.

447
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:19,303
- Me on TV.
- Practice a lot Frankie.

448
00:46:19,656 --> 00:46:23,987
Practice? l'll beat those heads to a shred. Only l got
to find a place where.

449
00:46:24,723 --> 00:46:27,541
Sash can't stand the noise.

450
00:46:28,194 --> 00:46:33,957
Molly? Do you think l could put the drums in your
place and sort of drop in once in a while?

451
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:39,631
Why not?
Molly, why not?

452
00:46:42,362 --> 00:46:45,995
- Johnny wouldn't understand.
- So, what could he do?

453
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:52,792
lt ain't a question of what he could do Frankie. A
fellow like Johnnie can't do much of anything.

454
00:46:53,528 --> 00:46:58,633
lt's a question of what it does to him. l'm all he has in
the world, and l don't want to hurt him.

455
00:46:59,407 --> 00:47:04,579
- Molly, for crying out loud....
- l want you to know Frankie, a fellow like him.......

456
00:47:06,811 --> 00:47:10,106
- ...Sometimes when we're all alone....
- What does he do? Cry?

457
00:47:10,762 --> 00:47:14,059
He's a lush Molly. He's a 100%/% habitual drunk!

458
00:47:14,682 --> 00:47:17,500
Look, everybody's a habitual something. With him it's
liquor, that's all.

459
00:47:18,436 --> 00:47:21,851
- Please Molly. Mollyo.
- lt ain'tjust that Frankie....

460
00:47:24,388 --> 00:47:30,476
l don't want it to start with us again. Look what you
said about us not seeing each other, it was the truth.

461
00:47:32,943 --> 00:47:35,736
Even if we went away, l'd try to.....

462
00:47:38,122 --> 00:47:41,321
ltjust doesn't add up. lt never did, it never can.

463
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:47,180
- Well give it a chance. l told you it would one day
-All my life's been ''one day''.

464
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:55,394
- On and on and on.
- l've got drums, l'm headed for a good job. ls that so
on and on and on?

465
00:47:56,049 --> 00:47:59,345
l make some money, l make Sash well. What's so on
and on about that?

466
00:48:00,538 --> 00:48:03,330
- Don't shut me out Molly l'm trying.
- You wanted to see me?

467
00:48:04,691 --> 00:48:07,508
- No!
- What do you mean ''no''?

468
00:48:16,202 --> 00:48:18,994
- Vi! Here, for what we owe. Frankie, Vi says can't
trust me.

469
00:48:19,578 --> 00:48:22,370
Tell her Frankie, what an honest hustler l am.

470
00:48:23,184 --> 00:48:27,701
Frankie! l guess maybe you could drop in once in a
while.

471
00:48:32,308 --> 00:48:35,119
Thanks Mollyo.

472
00:48:44,832 --> 00:48:47,625
See you tonight Molly.

473
00:49:57,254 --> 00:50:00,046
- How's that?
-Real nice.

474
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:08,991
- You should have heard what l did a little while ago. ..
- Good huh? l hope the neighbors liked it too.

475
00:50:11,127 --> 00:50:15,899
l'm very big with the neighbors. They keep banging
on the pipes to let me know how much they
appreciate it.

476
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:22,733
- l won't let it go to my head though.
- You keep playing drums at 5 a.m.....

477
00:50:23,045 --> 00:50:25,838
and you'll see what goes to your head.

478
00:50:28,915 --> 00:50:34,326
Slip me a smile and l'll give you my autograph. You
won't have to fight your way through the bobby soxers
to get to me.

479
00:50:34,643 --> 00:50:37,503
l bet those bobby-soxers go for that.

480
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:45,722
Tired?

481
00:50:46,497 --> 00:50:50,021
Yes, but in a very nice way. l've been feeling good all
night.

482
00:50:52,443 --> 00:50:55,738
- l joined the muscian's union today.
- Shrika loan you the money?

483
00:50:57,622 --> 00:51:01,863
- Him? Who did?
- Nobody. l'm going to hock the drums.

484
00:51:02,606 --> 00:51:05,414
- Oh Frankie!
- l've got it figured out pretty good.

485
00:51:06,227 --> 00:51:10,515
When l get a job, l'll take an advance and get the
drums out again. ln the meantime, l'll use the
practice pads.

486
00:51:11,176 --> 00:51:13,969
-You should have asked Shrika.
- Haven't even seen him.

487
00:51:14,897 --> 00:51:17,963
- You didn't go to work?
- No, l've been practicing here all night.

488
00:51:19,846 --> 00:51:24,031
- l quit the game Molly. .
- lt woulnd't have hurt you to wait a couple of days
Frank.

489
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:29,678
l wanted to quit. l'm quitting a couple of things.

490
00:51:35,970 --> 00:51:37,694
ls it bad?

491
00:51:41,341 --> 00:51:43,174
Not too bad.

492
00:51:47,325 --> 00:51:51,179
- You shouldn't have started again.
- Who knows why l started in the first place?

493
00:51:54,203 --> 00:52:01,100
l guess in the beginning you do it only for kicks. l got
my first shot for nothing.

494
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:09,430
l thought l could take it or leave it alone. So l took it.
And l took it again and again.

495
00:52:12,004 --> 00:52:15,746
One day Louie wasn't around. l nearly went crazy till l
found him.

496
00:52:17,641 --> 00:52:19,609
Lord l was sick!.

497
00:52:21,377 --> 00:52:26,473
l was so sick. You can't be that sick and live.

498
00:52:27,669 --> 00:52:29,960
That's when l knew l was hooked.

499
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:39,641
There was a 40 pound monkey on my back. The only
way to get along with a load like that, is to keep
getting a fix.

500
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:50,959
Don't.....

501
00:52:55,148 --> 00:52:57,439
l'm one of the lucky ones, Molly.

502
00:52:58,984 --> 00:53:04,208
l kicked it and l'm not too far hooked to kick it again.
l've had my last fix.

503
00:53:08,347 --> 00:53:12,110
Tell me something. Do you think those bobby-soxers'
will really go for me?

504
00:53:15,876 --> 00:53:18,669
Yes, they will.

505
00:53:20,173 --> 00:53:22,965
Maybe l'll get Sparrow a job with the orchestra.

506
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:32,669
And when l can get enough money together, l can get
Sash into a real good hospital, so she can walk and
dance again.

507
00:53:35,376 --> 00:53:37,024
And then maybe...

508
00:55:10,415 --> 00:55:13,228
- Who is it?
- Shrika, open up!

509
00:55:14,164 --> 00:55:15,926
Just a minute.

510
00:55:21,995 --> 00:55:24,636
- All right where is he?
- Frankie?

511
00:55:24,949 --> 00:55:27,011
- Frankie! Where is he?
- Well what is it, what did he do?

512
00:55:27,443 --> 00:55:30,617
What'd he do? You know what he did, he quit! No
notice, no nothing.

513
00:55:30,819 --> 00:55:34,934
He sends words by that mistress that he's through. l
had to take the spot myself. Where is he?

514
00:55:37,178 --> 00:55:40,756
- He wasn't at the game?
- Would we be looking for him all over, if he'd been at
the game?

515
00:55:41,649 --> 00:55:47,323
He eats my bread. Six years, he eats my bread. He
gets put away, l send you money regular. He gets out
and l give him his job back.

516
00:55:47,634 --> 00:55:50,426
- Shut up!
-What do you mean ''shut up''?

517
00:55:50,818 --> 00:55:53,884
Do you think it was easy talking men like Williams and
Marquee up to a two-bit game like you?

518
00:55:54,193 --> 00:55:55,688
- Louis.......Louis.....
- l sold them on Frankie.

519
00:55:55,881 --> 00:55:56,722
Why are we getting excited?

520
00:55:56,917 --> 00:56:01,150
They were a bat in the pocket and hungry for action.
We finally get a chance to score big....

521
00:56:02,048 --> 00:56:04,016
..and you lose the deal.

522
00:56:05,101 --> 00:56:09,541
Look Louie l swear. When Marquee and Williams
come, the dealer will be there. Or a playerjust as
good. ...

523
00:56:09,973 --> 00:56:11,150
There ain't none as good.

524
00:56:11,776 --> 00:56:14,568
- Why didn't you offer him more money, a piece of the
play.
- From your end or mine?

525
00:56:15,075 --> 00:56:18,403
What's the difference, whose end? You expect me to
stand here and argue about pennies?

526
00:56:30,164 --> 00:56:31,690
Look.

527
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:33,264
l'm a musician..

528
00:56:33,578 --> 00:56:34,843
Well, how does it feel?

529
00:56:35,036 --> 00:56:36,333
Well, it feels like....

530
00:56:37,529 --> 00:56:39,362
You'd better hang on to my arm, or l'll go up like a
balloon.

531
00:56:40,598 --> 00:56:42,551
l'm a musician.

532
00:56:43,974 --> 00:56:46,766
- Where are we going?
- l don't know, but l want to buy you something.

533
00:56:48,078 --> 00:56:50,045
- No.
- l've got to spend some money or l'll bust.

534
00:56:50,358 --> 00:56:52,666
- How about one of those, only in green?
- Frankie...

535
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:56,446
- Maybe a color TV set. They're pretty.

536
00:56:58,295 --> 00:57:00,019
Would you look at this production. ..

537
00:57:01,134 --> 00:57:03,545
And only for cooking. Now who would want a thing
like that?

538
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:08,799
- Boy, it's goofy huh?
- lt's pretty huh?

539
00:57:10,418 --> 00:57:12,479
- l wonder what he does for a living?
- Him?

540
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:18,196
He must make a nice dollar. Look at the way he
dresses her and a kitchen like that.

541
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:23,737
l notice he doesn't help her. l bet he didn't even
marry the girl. Look she ain't even wearing a ring on
her finger.

542
00:57:24,394 --> 00:57:28,605
She takes it off when she cooks, maybe and he's tired
after a hard days' work.

543
00:57:29,611 --> 00:57:34,826
Okay, let him sit there, but at least he could talk to her
once in a while. He doesn't have to sit there with his
nose buried in a magazine.

544
00:57:35,595 --> 00:57:38,390
- l would talk to her.
- What would you say?

545
00:57:39,325 --> 00:57:42,446
l'd say, how you been? How did it go today? What's
for supper?

546
00:57:42,764 --> 00:57:45,574
Steaks for supper and everything went fine today

547
00:57:46,081 --> 00:57:49,954
Steaks! Good. Now how about you and me stepping
out tonight after we eat.

548
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:55,286
- Why don't we just stay home and listen to music?
- Yeah.

549
00:57:56,477 --> 00:58:00,688
l like that better. We'll just stay home and turn on
some music.

550
00:58:02,576 --> 00:58:04,649
l wish it were Monday already.

551
00:58:07,595 --> 00:58:09,441
- Hi Sash!
- Where have you been?

552
00:58:10,338 --> 00:58:12,749
- Shrika has been here. He said you quit.
-Where have you been? Look!

553
00:58:13,292 --> 00:58:17,044
- Why did you quit him? l've got a try-out on Monday
-lf the band leader likes me, l'm hired.Jeg har måske
fået etjob med et band.

554
00:58:17,358 --> 00:58:22,377
Frankie, go tell Shrika you was fooling, you'll deal.
Maybe this band leader won't like how you play

555
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:24,872
Sash look. l joined a muscian's union.

556
00:58:26,642 --> 00:58:33,038
Why do you got to go around changing things? Why
can't it be like always? Why do you got to quit dealing
Frankie?

557
00:58:33,817 --> 00:58:37,002
- How we going to live with no money coming in?
- lt'll start coming in Monday.

558
00:58:37,319 --> 00:58:40,767
Suppose they call this great ''try-out'' of. You can't tell
me it's a sure thing, can you?

559
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:45,985
Frankie, deal for Shrika like always. Forget this
''great'' job!

560
00:58:46,832 --> 00:58:53,886
l quit dealing Sash. l can't take the chance, don't you
understand? lf the joint gets raided and l get picked
up again, Mr. Lane would be through with me.

561
00:58:54,553 --> 00:58:59,025
-And then how will l play with a band?
- How you going to play if Shrika gets your arms
broke?

562
00:59:00,809 --> 00:59:04,366
- What?
-Yeah, right here he said it. And he wanted to slap me
around too.

563
00:59:05,796 --> 00:59:08,588
Why can't it be like always?

564
00:59:35,837 --> 00:59:37,441
Antek!

565
00:59:43,088 --> 00:59:47,419
- You miserable piece of humanity.
- l've got a right to quit if l want.

566
00:59:47,921 --> 00:59:51,369
- Marquee and Williams are coming tomorrow.
- Don't you realize the signifigcance? Leave me
alone.

567
00:59:52,259 --> 00:59:56,160
l'll leave you alone. ln the alley with the cats looking.

568
00:59:56,586 --> 00:59:59,396
That's enough Shrika. lf he don't want to deal, he
don't want to deal.

569
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:03,657
- What are you talking about?
- Don't you raise your voice to me, you slob.

570
01:00:04,621 --> 01:00:07,152
He's no slave. You can't force him, so what's the
use?

571
01:00:07,805 --> 01:00:10,598
- He....
- We've had the best of him all these years. Don't be
a pig!

572
01:00:11,641 --> 01:00:13,933
He ain't interested.

573
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:20,177
All right, all right. Marquee and Williams have never
heard of him. Money? Something to blow your nose
on.

574
01:00:21,069 --> 01:00:22,574
l wash my hands.

575
01:00:25,503 --> 01:00:27,106
He's just a pig, that's all.

576
01:00:28,456 --> 01:00:34,589
Still you can't blame him, so much. Let the biggest
ones get away, because the best dealer isn't working
for you anymore.

577
01:00:35,822 --> 01:00:37,196
That ain't easy to swallow.

578
01:00:38,085 --> 01:00:39,689
You're the best all right.

579
01:00:40,118 --> 01:00:45,051
- You're a squeeze player Louis.
-Been tried on you before?

580
01:00:45,785 --> 01:00:47,860
NNah, l'm new around here..

581
01:00:48,643 --> 01:00:52,204
- Are we really asking so much dealer?
- One night. l will...

582
01:00:52,599 --> 01:00:57,846
You help us make a bundle and we'll spread that
sunshine around. Couldn't you use a couple of
hundred?

583
01:00:59,273 --> 01:01:02,066
Maybe 2 5 0?

584
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,593
2 5 0 pays a lot of doctor bills.

585
01:01:09,612 --> 01:01:10,644
- Tomorrow huh?
- Frankie...

586
01:01:10,963 --> 01:01:12,622
Let him make up his own mind.

587
01:01:15,091 --> 01:01:20,306
Okay, but for one night. Win or lose. Sunup, l case
the deck.

588
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:25,749
Sure, you're the dealer. What a load off. Now l can
sleep. Take care of that arm.

589
01:01:28,786 --> 01:01:34,708
Quite a character huh? Are you jacking up the price
right now, or do you really have that music job?

590
01:01:39,348 --> 01:01:41,410
lf they like what they hear.

591
01:01:42,877 --> 01:01:46,980
Chancy huh? Nervous?

592
01:01:50,435 --> 01:01:53,227
-So, what are we waiting for?
- Don't talk about it. lt's tough enough.

593
01:01:53,964 --> 01:01:57,372
l know, l know. l put down a craving once.

594
01:01:58,734 --> 01:02:03,434
No, candy, sweets. l used to be eating it all the time.

595
01:02:04,526 --> 01:02:09,545
Got examined for the army and they said you've got
sugar in your blood friend. You've got to give up
sweets forever, or it's good-bye Charlie.

596
01:02:11,431 --> 01:02:17,137
- l had to give up candy.
- My gums bleed for you. lt's awful.

597
01:02:18,106 --> 01:02:24,375
lt was. That unfinished feeling that you got all the
time. Well, l don't have to tell you.

598
01:02:24,917 --> 01:02:28,388
- So don't!
-l mean you got this one thing on the mind all the
time.

599
01:02:29,819 --> 01:02:32,612
- Can't stop thinking about it.
-You're just a mine of information aren't you?.

600
01:02:33,463 --> 01:02:34,728
You know what l did?

about the dealer. The game's just going on a day and
a half, he'll come through.

710

Why not, with those educated fingers. Now you see
it, now you don't.

711
01:15:15,543 --> 01:15:20,821
You keep your dirty mouth off the dealer. Frankie
runs a clean game and there ain't nothing in the world
that could make him change that.

712
01:15:23,875 --> 01:15:25,713
Hey Antak....

Just a little longer l'm going to make a call, then l'll

725
01:16:27,471 --> 01:16:30,263
- Now where were we.

-l can't raise another cent
- De bliver ved at smide penge på bordet

728
01:17:14,335 --> 01:17:15,710
Every pot almost, they're raising and raising until we
are forced out.

729
01:17:16,369 --> 01:17:19,161
- What day is it?
- Kan du ikke finde nogen vi kan låne af?

-Shrika won't let me. He keeps nudging me to fold.

734
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:41,235
You can't be sure though. There's a way you can be
sure. You can do anything you want with those cards.

735
01:17:41,546 --> 01:17:43,728
That's only for fun. l haven't got nerve to do it for real.

736
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:45,534
- You want to get out of here, don't you?
- What?

737
01:17:45,845 --> 01:17:50,199
- You want to get to that try-out in good condition,
don't you?
- Yeah, l want to get there feeling good.

754
01:19:58,495 --> 01:20:01,296
How was l to know. You fellows, you know l've been
running an honest game. Tell them!

755
01:20:08,823 --> 01:20:10,197
Frankie...

756
01:20:13,119 --> 01:20:15,181
Everything's all right now Frankie.

757
01:20:18,932 --> 01:20:28,587
Frankie, what's a little cupping around huh? Nothing.
Am l right? You'll see.

758
01:20:35,573 --> 01:20:39,904
You should have seen Shrika's face, when Williams
said he'd get to him in a minute.

759
01:20:41,025 --> 01:20:43,832
He went white! lt was so funny

760
01:20:45,228 --> 01:20:47,191
Cut it out, you hear me!

761
01:20:48,313 --> 01:20:52,533
- You was the best sport l knew my whole life.
- You hear me?

762
01:20:56,224 --> 01:20:58,134
Stay away from me punk!

763
01:21:22,898 --> 01:21:25,691
- Hurry quick!
- l want to get some sleep.

764
01:21:27,425 --> 01:21:32,226
lt's beginning to wear off quit for you? You're a
graduating student. You're going to have to step it up.

765
01:21:33,079 --> 01:21:35,886
- Please hurry.
- All right

766
01:21:37,089 --> 01:21:39,897
- Let's see your money.
- Later, later!

767
01:21:40,826 --> 01:21:42,659
- Right now.
- Trust me this once, will you?

768
01:21:43,319 --> 01:21:44,465
No, l don't do that.

769
01:21:44,892 --> 01:21:47,685
l'll pay you twice as much later, but l got to do
something right now.

770
01:21:48,537 --> 01:21:50,031
l'll even push for you. Louis heard.

771
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:54,433
-A flipping junkie always says that.
- Louis, please.

772
01:21:55,212 --> 01:21:57,174
Get your dirty hands off me.

773
01:22:19,239 --> 01:22:20,660
Frankie...

774
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:23,776
- Wake up. Get up!
- Where did you put it?

775
01:22:24,593 --> 01:22:27,401
- Where do you keep it?
- Let him go.

776
01:22:28,680 --> 01:22:31,481
l can't find it.

777
01:22:32,563 --> 01:22:35,355
Frankie, please let me take you home.

778
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:40,112
l've got to be on time.

779
01:22:45,685 --> 01:22:47,417
Frankie...

780
01:23:09,057 --> 01:23:11,859
What's the matter. Come on, let's try to really cook it.

781
01:23:13,022 --> 01:23:14,865
- Mr. Machine.
- Mr. Lanes.

782
01:23:15,298 --> 01:23:16,679
- Can you read music?
- Yes.

783
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:20,032
Shelby, let Mr. Machine sit in on this one.

784
01:23:23,686 --> 01:23:25,104
Number 37, it's right in front of you.

785
01:23:27,905 --> 01:23:29,509
Do you know it Mr. Machine?

786
01:23:30,821 --> 01:23:34,269
Okay, let's try.

787
01:23:34,695 --> 01:23:38,816
Mr. Machine, the first four bars are all you. Come on,
let's try it again.

788
01:23:39,782 --> 01:23:42,589
One, two, three, four.

789
01:23:44,794 --> 01:23:47,590
- l'm sorry. .
-Are you all set?

790
01:23:48,979 --> 01:23:51,771
Once again. One, two, three, four

791
01:24:27,672 --> 01:24:29,558
Okay Shelby, let's go.

792
01:24:59,674 --> 01:25:03,082
- Sash, have we any money?
- l need some money. No, what's the matter?

793
01:25:04,781 --> 01:25:05,049
There was some around here yesterday, wasn't
there? l need some money Sash.

794
01:25:05,049 --> 01:25:07,581
There was some around here yesterday, wasn't
there? l need some money Sash.

795
01:25:07,581 --> 01:25:09,337
Well, there isn't any. What is it Frankie?

796
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:11,679
What is it?

797
01:25:55,482 --> 01:25:58,045
You can walk? Since when?

798
01:26:04,842 --> 01:26:09,116
What's the angle? What are you and Frankie trying to
prove?

799
01:26:11,586 --> 01:26:14,393
Come on tell me. One hustler to another

800
01:26:15,210 --> 01:26:21,224
Let me in on it or l'll croon for it, you hear? l'll tell
everybody you can walk, you always could.

801
01:26:22,117 --> 01:26:24,910
l'll tell them all you can walk, you old phoney!.

802
01:26:26,989 --> 01:26:29,782
No....Louis!.

803
01:26:32,216 --> 01:26:35,022
No Louis, you can't do that. You can't tell anybody
Please Louis.

804
01:26:35,724 --> 01:26:38,530
- Keep your hands off me.
- Please Louis.

805
01:27:32,549 --> 01:27:35,341
Molly...Molly.

806
01:27:56,935 --> 01:28:02,030
Ain't that the way it happened? They had a fight and
the next thing you know, Louis is falling.

807
01:28:03,149 --> 01:28:07,709
Come on, level Sash. Don't try to out-think me, you'll
only get tangled.

808
01:28:08,558 --> 01:28:13,135
l don't know anything about a fight. l was sleeping
the whole morning, right here in this chair

809
01:28:13,795 --> 01:28:18,026
Then for all you know, it did happen that way While
you were sleeping, Frankie shoved him over.

810
01:28:18,921 --> 01:28:21,721
- He didn't!
- How do you know it? You were sleeping.

811
01:28:23,685 --> 01:28:28,126
lt wasn't like l was sleeping, more like dozing kind of.
l'd have heard a fight, if there was one.

812
01:28:29,900 --> 01:28:31,547
Frankie didn't do it, he wasn't even here.

813
01:28:32,278 --> 01:28:35,073
- When wasn't he here?
- When it happened.

814
01:28:35,697 --> 01:28:38,504
How can you be sure if you was dozing?

815
01:28:39,205 --> 01:28:42,011
I was up when he Ieft. That's how I'm sure. I saw hIm
go.

816
01:28:42,983 --> 01:28:44,484
And he was home this morning.

817
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:48,778
Only a second. He didn't get in a fight, he was here
only a second.

818
01:28:50,014 --> 01:28:52,807
Why didn't he stick around? Was somebody after
him?

819
01:28:53,275 --> 01:28:56,493
Nobody was after him, nobody. He just wanted some
money is all.

820
01:28:56,919 --> 01:28:59,374
- Money? What for?
- l don't know what for.

821
01:28:59,374 --> 01:29:02,179
A fix! He wanted it for a fix from Louis.

822
01:29:03,266 --> 01:29:06,347
- lt had nothing to do with Louis.
- How do you know?

823
01:29:07,351 --> 01:29:11,577
Cause there was no money. Why would he want to
see Louis for a fix, he there was no money?

824
01:29:12,468 --> 01:29:14,421
To try and get one without money

825
01:29:16,189 --> 01:29:21,208
Okay, l can wait. Wherever he is, sooner or later he's
got to come up for a fix.

826
01:29:27,982 --> 01:29:30,788
Molly, Molly wait please.

827
01:29:31,065 --> 01:29:33,027
lt's finished Frankie. Like l told you.

828
01:29:33,687 --> 01:29:36,487
-But l've got to talk to you Molly,
- No!

829
01:29:37,531 --> 01:29:39,254
Once and for all!

830
01:29:39,909 --> 01:29:42,702
Molly, l've got to talk to you.

831
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:45,275
You got any money Molly? l need a few dollars.

832
01:29:46,239 --> 01:29:49,032
10 dollars would do it. l'd get it back to you in a few
days.

833
01:29:49,654 --> 01:29:53,303
Or 5 even. Five would be fine, please.

834
01:29:54,202 --> 01:29:58,892
l feel so sick Molly. l hurt all over. l feel so bad.

835
01:30:00,444 --> 01:30:04,776
Don't say no, please don't say no. Why not Molly
why not?

836
01:30:05,548 --> 01:30:08,340
Jump off a rope if you're going to kill yourself, but
don't ask me to help you.

837
01:30:10,074 --> 01:30:12,867
l'll do anything for you Molly...

838
01:30:13,565 --> 01:30:18,373
- But right now you've got to help me. l need a shot.
- No!

839
01:30:19,611 --> 01:30:24,302
Five would do it, or three or two even, but please
hurry.

840
01:30:25,045 --> 01:30:27,339
You mustn't take that dirty stuf no more.

841
01:30:27,772 --> 01:30:33,139
l know, l know you're right. l promise, but right now l
just need a fix. Just one fix.

842
01:30:34,101 --> 01:30:38,891
lt'll help me stop hurting. Then l promise you, l'll kick
it for good. Just a few dollars Molly.

843
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:48,903
Hello Molly. l just wanted to come and say hello.

844
01:30:49,685 --> 01:30:53,092
- Ain't you going to let me in?
- l asked you please to not bother me any more.

845
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:57,625
- l miss you.
- Look, l'm awfully tired Johnny.

846
01:30:58,051 --> 01:31:00,462
- l'll stay only a few minutes.
- No.

847
01:31:02,463 --> 01:31:06,224
- Who's in there with you?
- Go away Johnny and don't come back.

848
01:31:06,886 --> 01:31:09,691
Who is it? Not the dealer! You ain't hiding him, are
you?

849
01:31:10,546 --> 01:31:13,966
- You wouldn't be dumb enough to be an accessory
would you?
- What do you mean accessory?

850
01:31:14,631 --> 01:31:17,429
He killed Louis. The cops are looking for him this
minute.

851
01:31:18,012 --> 01:31:20,805
- Frankie Machine.
- ls he in there?

852
01:31:22,654 --> 01:31:24,302
- No.
- l'm coming in!

853
01:31:24,687 --> 01:31:26,672
Not if you ever want to see me again.

854
01:31:27,296 --> 01:31:31,516
- Will you meet me tomorrow.
- Yeah, l'll be around the bar

855
01:31:31,832 --> 01:31:33,674
Maybe not tomorrow, but soon.

856
01:31:34,107 --> 01:31:35,410
l miss you.

857
01:31:44,686 --> 01:31:47,479
Honest, l didn't.

858
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:51,507
What am l going to do?

859
01:31:52,819 --> 01:31:56,702
- Go tell Bedner, it wasn't you.
- l couldn't.

860
01:31:57,821 --> 01:32:00,122
l couldn't stand up to the cops the way l am.

861
01:32:02,136 --> 01:32:05,600
Look at me. l'd say anything they'd want me to say
just for a shot.

862
01:32:06,910 --> 01:32:12,049
- Then get cured first.
-What are you talking about? How am l suppose to
get cured.

863
01:32:12,588 --> 01:32:17,454
-You did it once..
-That was with help, with medicine and doctors.

864
01:32:18,802 --> 01:32:21,604
l can't go apply at Lexington with a murder hanging
over my head.

865
01:32:22,865 --> 01:32:24,936
Couldn't you do it without going there?

866
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:28,480
You mean just stop?

867
01:32:29,601 --> 01:32:31,557
Cold turkey?

868
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:35,006
You don't understand. The pain.

869
01:32:35,934 --> 01:32:37,582
What else can you do?

870
01:32:38,658 --> 01:32:41,451
All l need is just one shot, just one.

871
01:32:43,530 --> 01:32:45,369
Okay.

872
01:32:50,117 --> 01:32:52,188
All right, here take it!

873
01:32:52,853 --> 01:32:59,684
Here, go on take it all. Cause after that one shot, all
you're going to need is another.

874
01:33:00,115 --> 01:33:03,988
And then another and another Take it!

875
01:33:05,332 --> 01:33:07,165
Take it!

876
01:33:08,017 --> 01:33:14,863
- Why should you hurt, like other people hurt?
- You had a dog's life, but never a break.

877
01:33:16,452 --> 01:33:25,788
Why try to face it, like most people do? No just roll up
all your pains, into one big hurt and then flatten it with
a fix.

878
01:33:27,901 --> 01:33:30,192
What do you think you'll find just outside that door?

879
01:33:33,540 --> 01:33:37,889
Don't you think Bedner knows what you are, and what
you need?

880
01:33:39,010 --> 01:33:41,202
Just to get through that next hour...

881
01:33:43,325 --> 01:33:46,860
Don't you know, he's just waiting for you to come and
get it.

882
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:52,918
Go on. Let him kill you!

883
01:33:54,767 --> 01:33:58,400
Let him kill you. lt'll be quicker and better than doing
it your way.

884
01:34:04,766 --> 01:34:06,497
No!

885
01:34:08,504 --> 01:34:10,345
No!

886
01:34:11,927 --> 01:34:16,794
l won't let him kill me. No!

887
01:34:19,945 --> 01:34:22,127
And l won't run into no grave.

888
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:29,205
But kicking it......

889
01:34:31,756 --> 01:34:34,561
A guy can't do it by himself.

890
01:34:38,793 --> 01:34:40,975
l'll help.

891
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:48,452
You know what you are letting yourself in for? lt ain't
pretty.

892
01:34:49,651 --> 01:34:51,493
And it could be dangerous.

893
01:34:52,618 --> 01:34:55,424
lf they find you here, then they find you, is all.

894
01:34:56,125 --> 01:35:00,279
l don't mean dangerous from Bedner. l mean
dangerous for me.

895
01:35:03,626 --> 01:35:09,103
Sometimes a junkie will kill, to get away from the
treatment.

896
01:35:10,531 --> 01:35:11,828
Understand?

897
01:35:13,945 --> 01:35:18,065
So if you've got any knives or scissors in the house,
you've got to put them away for a while.

898
01:35:19,839 --> 01:35:25,921
And don't let me out of the room. No matter what l
say, or promise, or how much l beg.

899
01:35:27,001 --> 01:35:29,793
Cause if l get out, it'll only be for a fix.

900
01:35:31,642 --> 01:35:33,366
That's the way it is. Do you understand?

901
01:35:34,251 --> 01:35:38,582
Just lock me in the room. And if l try to make a break
for it, just stop me any way you know how

902
01:35:40,125 --> 01:35:45,516
And no matter how much you see it hurting me, don't
try to help me with pills or dope or anything else.

903
01:35:50,027 --> 01:35:52,823
Do you think you can handle it?

904
01:36:09,773 --> 01:36:11,503
Here we go.

905
01:36:12,817 --> 01:36:14,427
Down and dirty.

906
01:36:17,702 --> 01:36:21,334
You can't hold me.

907
01:36:23,494 --> 01:36:25,556
Sit down.

908
01:36:26,410 --> 01:36:30,748
You can't hold me. l ain't got all my marbles, you
know that Captain.

909
01:36:31,869 --> 01:36:34,060
Write down the cases Sparrow.

910
01:36:34,951 --> 01:36:37,756
- l didn't do nothing.
- But Frankie did something all right.

911
01:36:38,457 --> 01:36:40,188
Now, l want you to tell me about it.

912
01:36:40,576 --> 01:36:46,828
Whoever killed that peddlar, should get a ticker-tape
parade. Yeah, and maybe l'd lead the band, but l still
want you to tell me about it.

913
01:36:47,712 --> 01:36:53,036
Listen to me Sparrow. When we catch him, he stands
trial, whether you talk, or whether you don't.

914
01:36:55,314 --> 01:36:58,119
The only question is, do l ticket you as an accessory?

915
01:37:00,054 --> 01:37:04,097
Bedner, don't nail me to the cross. He's the only guy
l've ever had for a friend.

916
01:37:05,062 --> 01:37:11,239
He's nobody's friend anymore. He smash you with a
steam roller, if you got between him and a pop in the
arm.

917
01:37:12,199 --> 01:37:14,992
Come on talk Sparrow.

918
01:37:18,644 --> 01:37:20,638
Okay, beat it.

919
01:39:16,170 --> 01:39:18,963
Let me out!

920
01:39:49,985 --> 01:39:51,946
Yes?

921
01:39:59,654 --> 01:40:03,292
- l thought l'd come and see how you've been Sash.
-All alone, that's how l've been.

922
01:40:05,183 --> 01:40:07,976
Something to eat. Sausage.

923
01:40:09,019 --> 01:40:13,504
All alone and worried sick. Where is he? Do you
know where he is?

924
01:40:14,471 --> 01:40:16,080
Did he go to you?

925
01:40:18,014 --> 01:40:19,745
What do you want anyway?

926
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:25,520
What do you want anyway?

927
01:40:26,065 --> 01:40:29,938
l didn't tell Bedner anything. The papers, they twist
everything all up.

928
01:40:30,476 --> 01:40:32,538
They wouldn't be able to, if you didn't let them.

929
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:35,992
l can't help what they do. What do you expect me to
do, sitting here?

930
01:40:37,611 --> 01:40:41,255
Just tell Bedner that Frankie wasn't here when it
happened. That he didn't do it.

931
01:40:42,037 --> 01:40:46,496
- l never said he did.
- But that's how it sounds, if he was the only one
around at the time.

932
01:40:47,738 --> 01:40:49,578
And you know it was somebody else.

933
01:40:50,666 --> 01:40:52,849
What do you mean? Who?

934
01:40:53,621 --> 01:40:57,374
don't know. But maybe Bedner could figure it out if he
didn't think it was Frankie.

935
01:40:57,802 --> 01:40:59,755
What business is it of yours anyway?

936
01:40:59,950 --> 01:41:01,706
l just want to help, that's all.

937
01:41:02,789 --> 01:41:06,127
Who are you kidding? You think l don't know what
you really want?

938
01:41:07,331 --> 01:41:11,220
You think l don't know what you and him have been
up to behind my back, while l had to sit here all these
years?

939
01:41:12,108 --> 01:41:15,450
- Had to sit here all these years.
- No Sasha, you've got it wrong.

940
01:41:15,767 --> 01:41:22,129
No! You've got it wrong! He put me in this chair, and
as long as l sit here, he'll never leave me.

941
01:41:22,673 --> 01:41:25,466
- He knows he belongs to me.
- Sash, l came only to help.

942
01:41:26,049 --> 01:41:30,387
l wouldn't want to live it he left me, and l would rather
see him dead, than go to you.

943
01:41:30,815 --> 01:41:32,775
- Sash, please.
- YES, get out of here!

944
01:41:33,087 --> 01:41:35,158
GET OUT OF HERE YOU LOUSYTRAMP!

945
01:41:35,938 --> 01:41:38,743
Get out!

946
01:42:38,437 --> 01:42:39,931
Frankie NO!

947
01:42:41,698 --> 01:42:44,494
- l can't stand it any longer
-Just a little longer.

948
01:42:44,887 --> 01:42:47,691
Please help me. Keep me warm.

949
01:42:52,398 --> 01:42:55,202
l've got to get out and get a fix.

950
01:42:56,479 --> 01:42:59,883
Open the door, or l'll kill you..

951
01:43:00,661 --> 01:43:03,454
- l'll kill you.
- Frankie, listen, if you......

952
01:43:04,075 --> 01:43:06,868
- But l do have something put away to make it stop.
- Give it to me quick!

953
01:43:10,181 --> 01:43:12,141
Where? l'll get it.

954
01:43:17,461 --> 01:43:20,265
Molly! Molly!

955
01:43:21,427 --> 01:43:24,220
Let me out!

956
01:43:25,609 --> 01:43:28,401
Molly open the door.

957
01:43:40,945 --> 01:43:43,749
Frankie? Frankie, answer me.

958
01:43:52,052 --> 01:43:54,845
Frankie answer me. Are you all right?

959
01:43:56,004 --> 01:43:58,797
Don't think you can fool me into opening this door l
won't.

960
01:43:59,961 --> 01:44:02,765
Are you all right Frankie? Please answer me.

961
01:44:13,164 --> 01:44:17,267
Molly, if you love me, kill me, please!

962
01:44:18,228 --> 01:44:21,020
Oh, l'm so cold.

963
01:44:25,486 --> 01:44:28,290
Make me warm.

964
01:44:32,649 --> 01:44:35,453
Molly...

965
01:44:38,457 --> 01:44:40,519
Please Molly, make me warm...

966
01:44:45,247 --> 01:44:48,269
Oh Molly, l'm so cold!

967
01:45:00,215 --> 01:45:01,518
Oh God, O God.

968
01:45:01,908 --> 01:45:04,701
Please make me warm Molly.

969
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:09,113
l'm so cold..

970
01:45:46,730 --> 01:45:50,728
- l waited for you in the bar.
- l told you it might not be right away

971
01:45:51,042 --> 01:45:58,211
l thought maybe you were sick or something. l just
wanted to tell you, don't look for me at the bar
anymore. He threw me out last night, we had a little
argument.

972
01:45:58,714 --> 01:46:01,507
- So make it the Safari huh?
- Yeah, sure Johnny, sure.

973
01:46:08,134 --> 01:46:09,974
Pretty good, huh Molly?

974
01:46:12,447 --> 01:46:15,251
- Take it slow now.
- Oh, l'm all right.

975
01:46:15,643 --> 01:46:17,477
Just a little rocky.

976
01:46:31,503 --> 01:46:34,307
lt's the most gorgeous day l ever saw.

977
01:46:35,815 --> 01:46:38,619
l think it's the first day l ever saw.

978
01:46:39,590 --> 01:46:41,886
l've got a craving for something sweet. Have you got
anything sweet?

979
01:46:43,086 --> 01:46:45,038
- Sugar?
- Gimme!

980
01:46:51,372 --> 01:46:54,170
More, come on, more.

981
01:46:56,797 --> 01:46:59,600
How can you Frankie?

982
01:47:00,994 --> 01:47:07,069
I neverfeltthis good In my Iife. I feeI IIke aII the thIngs
Insise of me are settlIIng Into pIace.

983
01:47:09,069 --> 01:47:11,862
Thanks Molly. Mollyo!

984
01:47:13,366 --> 01:47:16,890
- Look out, you'll scrape your face off!
- l don't care.

985
01:47:18,933 --> 01:47:21,736
- You got a razor l can use?
- Can l trust you with one?

986
01:47:22,437 --> 01:47:24,507
Cross my heart.

987
01:47:46,498 --> 01:47:47,999
- ls this the place?
- Yeah.

988
01:47:48,424 --> 01:47:51,228
- Okay, come on.
- No please, you don't need me up there.

989
01:48:11,446 --> 01:48:14,250
-Where is he Molly?
- He didn't do it, honest.

990
01:48:14,666 --> 01:48:17,470
l'm not a judge. They pay me to bring him in, that's
all.

991
01:48:18,671 --> 01:48:22,082
lf you tell me where he is, l promise you that he'll get
every break a jockey can get.

992
01:48:22,515 --> 01:48:25,810
- He's no jockey either. That's finished.
- Oh sure, you bet.

993
01:48:26,811 --> 01:48:30,717
- You can see for yourself.
- He ain't running away from you. So, where is he?

994
01:48:32,450 --> 01:48:36,262
- With Sash.
-All right Molly. Let's go see.

995
01:48:46,887 --> 01:48:50,335
- Hello Sash.
- What are you doing here?

996
01:48:51,068 --> 01:48:55,324
- Frankie, don't you know that Bedner is looking for
you?
- Don't worry about it Sash, l ain't afraid.

997
01:48:56,171 --> 01:49:00,394
- l didn't do it and you know that
- Who did then?

998
01:49:01,865 --> 01:49:04,669
l've come to tell you something Sash.....

999
01:49:05,023 --> 01:49:08,944
- l'm leaving here.
- Bedner will arrest you. He told the newspapers
you.....

1000
01:49:11,183 --> 01:49:13,975
- What?
- l'm leaving.

1001
01:49:15,364 --> 01:49:19,804
You won't have to worry about money or anything. l
find a way to send some regular to you .

1002
01:49:21,118 --> 01:49:23,917
-And Vi will take good care of you.
-Leaving me!?

1003
01:49:25,658 --> 01:49:28,461
Not leaving you Sash, just leaving.

1004
01:49:30,085 --> 01:49:33,657
You saw what happened since l came back. Like Dr.
Lennex told me.....

1005
01:49:35,091 --> 01:49:38,652
l got in the same old routine and before l knew it, l
was on it again.

1006
01:49:39,851 --> 01:49:43,528
But you can't leave me. You've got to stay and take
care of me.

1007
01:49:45,184 --> 01:49:47,596
l know l'm responsible for how you are Sash....

1008
01:49:48,372 --> 01:49:51,174
but l can't go around the rest of my life stoning myself
about it.

1009
01:49:52,107 --> 01:49:57,802
l've been carrying my heart ever since it happened.
Even now it hurts me to think about it, but.....

1010
01:50:01,999 --> 01:50:04,791
Well, it's not that l want to leave, l've got to leave.

1011
01:50:06,525 --> 01:50:09,318
You mustn't leave Frankie! You mustn't.

1012
01:50:10,937 --> 01:50:12,541
Sash....

1013
01:50:13,858 --> 01:50:17,669
- Say good-bye to me Sash.
- You think you're fooling me?

1014
01:50:18,633 --> 01:50:20,702
l know what's pulling you away Molly!

1015
01:50:21,598 --> 01:50:24,401
- No.
- Yeah, you just go so that you can be with that little
tramp!

1016
01:50:27,292 --> 01:50:28,895
- Frankie no...
- Good-bye Sash.

1017
01:50:29,025 --> 01:50:30,977
No Frankie, please don't leave.

1018
01:50:32,170 --> 01:50:34,963
Frankie no, don't leave me.

1019
01:50:56,811 --> 01:50:59,102
Get dressed Sash..

1020
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:35,060
Sash!

1021
01:51:39,336 --> 01:51:40,868
Sash Stop!

1022
01:51:44,328 --> 01:51:45,702
Sash!

1023
01:52:01,472 --> 01:52:02,742
Sash!

1024
01:52:07,358 --> 01:52:09,889
Sash, don't move.

1025
01:52:10,887 --> 01:52:13,178
Don't try to talk. You're going to be all right.

1026
01:52:19,604 --> 01:52:22,408
l love you so much!
