1
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:56,609
At the next intersection,
why don't you turn south?

2
00:03:56,749 --> 00:04:00,341
Chocolate Mountains were east
last time we headed that way.

3
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:03,580
Who needs the mountains?
Head for San Felipe.

4
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,101
There's nothing to do
in San Felipe but fish.

5
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:07,547
Well...

6
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:10,448
That was the idea, wasn't it?

7
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:13,625
Yeah, I guess so.

8
00:04:14,465 --> 00:04:18,283
We might just pick up a drink in Mexicale.

9
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:22,780
- Remember Floribel at the Alhambra Club?
- Yeah.

10
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:26,171
She's probably dead by now.
It was a long time ago.

11
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:29,371
Yeah. Poor old Floribel.

12
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,691
Well, there's no harm
in drinking a toast to her.

13
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:33,991
Well, okay.

14
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:41,551
Except for the war, this is my first time
away from Maudie and the kids.

15
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:46,467
- D'you wanna turn back?
- No, no. We've come this far.

16
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:49,405
Mexicale's beginning to sound good.

17
00:04:58,593 --> 00:05:00,435
Guess maybes.

18
00:05:03,869 --> 00:05:06,274
I remember that joint.

19
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:39,267
Bienvenidos, caballeros!
Bienvenidos a Mexico...

20
00:05:39,367 --> 00:05:41,462
This is the place, señores, come in.

21
00:05:41,562 --> 00:05:45,301
Juanita's starting her famous fan dance.
You're just in time.

22
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:49,352
We might as well take a look.
Hey, Gil! Gil?

23
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:54,490
Sorry, friend, no sale.

24
00:06:01,557 --> 00:06:05,038
Oh, well. San Felipe, here we come.

25
00:06:24,154 --> 00:06:25,593
- Out of gas?
- Yeah.

26
00:06:25,693 --> 00:06:27,163
Hop in.

27
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:38,750
We're going to San Felipe, you can
pick up gas there and hitch a ride back.

28
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,924
- Waiting out there long?
- Yeah.

29
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,627
Light me a cigarette.

30
00:06:53,021 --> 00:06:54,579
Smoke?

31
00:06:55,818 --> 00:06:57,576
No.

32
00:06:58,716 --> 00:07:01,238
What are you doing, rolling 'em?

33
00:07:03,186 --> 00:07:05,234
Face front.

34
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,158
And keep driving.

35
00:07:10,754 --> 00:07:13,234
Sure, I'm Emmet Myers.

36
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:16,251
Do what I tell you, and no fast moves.

37
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:19,351
A lot of dead heroes back there got nervous.

38
00:07:23,263 --> 00:07:26,156
From now on, when you're driving,
keep both hands high on that wheel.

39
00:07:26,256 --> 00:07:29,033
You, keep one hand on the top of this seat,

40
00:07:30,123 --> 00:07:32,920
the other hand high on that window.

41
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,715
All right. Now turn off
the next side road we come to.

42
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,832
Pull up.

43
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:59,026
Open the glove compartment.

44
00:08:04,185 --> 00:08:05,701
What's the box?

45
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:08,595
- Cartridges, 22s.
- Give 'em to me.

46
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,928
Close it.

47
00:08:19,773 --> 00:08:22,700
Now this is how we get out, after this.

48
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,700
First, give me the keys.

49
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:30,702
Now we oughta
get out the same side, this one.

50
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,845
I get out first, then you.

51
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:36,565
Stand away from the car. And then you.

52
00:08:37,053 --> 00:08:38,958
Let's go.

53
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:48,468
Drop your jackets around your elbows.

54
00:08:57,562 --> 00:08:59,356
Turn around.

55
00:09:02,211 --> 00:09:05,710
We're gonna open the trunk. Move.

56
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,012
Pull your jackets up.

57
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,745
You, open the trunk.

58
00:09:18,855 --> 00:09:21,335
Both of you, keep your hands on the lid.

59
00:09:24,987 --> 00:09:26,863
Throw me the keys.

60
00:09:27,803 --> 00:09:29,480
Now get the blankets.

61
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,496
You'd never make it!

62
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:35,997
Get the groceries, you.

63
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:41,705
- Whose gun is that?
- Mine.

64
00:09:41,805 --> 00:09:44,505
- Do you like to shoot?
- Yeah.

65
00:09:44,644 --> 00:09:49,517
So do I. So I'm warning you,
don't try anything smart with me.

66
00:09:49,617 --> 00:09:51,599
Move!

67
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,461
I told you my name. What's yours?

68
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:42,314
Mine's Gilbert Bowen. He's Roy Collins.

69
00:10:42,414 --> 00:10:44,492
What do you do for a living?

70
00:10:44,592 --> 00:10:48,148
I'm a draughtsman. He runs a garage.

71
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,364
That makes you smarter.

72
00:10:50,464 --> 00:10:52,790
Or does it?

73
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,320
You're lucky. It hit an empty chamber.
I used it a while back.

74
00:11:00,431 --> 00:11:04,748
No fast moves!
The last guy made that mistake.

75
00:11:34,032 --> 00:11:36,309
When are you due back?

76
00:11:36,749 --> 00:11:39,141
No particular time.

77
00:11:39,842 --> 00:11:42,542
We told our wives to expect us home
when we got there.

78
00:11:42,781 --> 00:11:46,060
You got wives, huh? Any kids?

79
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:48,172
I have.

80
00:11:48,272 --> 00:11:51,472
Just keep thinking how nice
it'll be to see 'em again.

81
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,603
There's a checkpoint.
Slow down. No talking.

82
00:11:59,703 --> 00:12:02,282
If I give you the word, step on it.

83
00:12:31,947 --> 00:12:34,283
This car rides pretty good.

84
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:37,590
When I get where I'm going,
I think I'll sell it.

85
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,447
Where are we going?

86
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:45,676
Pull in at the next pump.
We'll fill up and get a road map.

87
00:12:46,116 --> 00:12:48,152
I got an idea.

88
00:12:48,342 --> 00:12:51,066
A pretty good one.

89
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:11,767
- Aquí estás, señor.
- Gracias.

90
00:13:11,867 --> 00:13:14,522
- Speak English, you.
- He doesn't understand English.

91
00:13:14,622 --> 00:13:16,023
I don't understand Mexican.

92
00:13:16,123 --> 00:13:18,123
Never mind the change, let's get out of here.

93
00:13:23,657 --> 00:13:24,961
Loco!

94
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:30,785
Gimme the map.

95
00:13:45,148 --> 00:13:47,763
Take the first side road we come to.

96
00:14:07,398 --> 00:14:09,105
Pull up.

97
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:14,589
Keys.

98
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:18,651
All right, now get out like I told you.

99
00:14:23,683 --> 00:14:28,004
Here, you're the smart guy.
Spread the map out on the hood.

100
00:14:32,351 --> 00:14:36,702
Get your hands up on the car.
Look for a town called Santa Rosalia.

101
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,296
How far is it?

102
00:14:42,736 --> 00:14:45,329
- About 500 miles.
- Is it on the Gulf of California?

103
00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:49,329
- Yeah.
- Say anything about a ferry across the Gulf?

104
00:14:49,968 --> 00:14:51,452
Friday.

105
00:14:52,248 --> 00:14:54,284
Not bad.

106
00:14:55,124 --> 00:14:57,421
We're loaded with time.

107
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:00,157
We can make that easy.

108
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:07,435
After that, I won't need you guys any more.

109
00:15:10,846 --> 00:15:13,458
I guess we won't be having rabbit for dinner.

110
00:15:13,798 --> 00:15:15,943
I wasn't trying.

111
00:15:23,371 --> 00:15:24,524
Collins.

112
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:27,648
Put the can on that rock there.

113
00:15:31,377 --> 00:15:33,677
Gimme the map.

114
00:15:41,168 --> 00:15:44,831
Not that one! The other one.

115
00:15:46,147 --> 00:15:48,653
That's it.

116
00:15:51,093 --> 00:15:53,792
All right, Collins.
Put the can back on the rock.

117
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:05,636
Don't forget, this is loaded too.
You try. Let's see how good you are.

118
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:13,595
Go ahead.

119
00:16:19,553 --> 00:16:21,991
Not bad.

120
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:24,045
Collins.

121
00:16:24,285 --> 00:16:26,611
Pick up the can.

122
00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:31,575
Take it onto that point there.

123
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:34,610
If you don't, I'll let Bowen have it.

124
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:37,206
Onto the point, that's right.

125
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:40,492
Further.

126
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:49,294
Now hold it up. You won't get hurt,
your buddy's good with guns.

127
00:16:50,334 --> 00:16:54,752
- You're crazy! I won't do it.
- It's just a game. Go ahead.

128
00:16:54,852 --> 00:16:57,933
Collins, hold it closer to you.

129
00:16:58,594 --> 00:17:03,197
What's the matter, are you scared?
Hold it closer.

130
00:17:03,437 --> 00:17:06,464
You want me to try?
I might miss this time.

131
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,491
Shoot.

132
00:17:41,074 --> 00:17:43,418
Come on Gil, get going.

133
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,180
Nervous? Relax.

134
00:17:54,036 --> 00:17:56,674
All right, Collins, come on in.

135
00:17:56,774 --> 00:17:58,056
Fun's over.

136
00:18:01,431 --> 00:18:04,514
You guys worked up quite a sweat.

137
00:18:28,376 --> 00:18:29,934
Collins.

138
00:18:31,794 --> 00:18:34,524
- Collins!
- What do you want?

139
00:18:34,624 --> 00:18:36,963
- Turn on the radio.
- Why bother?

140
00:18:37,063 --> 00:18:41,983
- All you get is Mexican commercials.
- Never mind. Turn it on.

141
00:18:50,952 --> 00:18:53,947
- Get something else.
- Like what?

142
00:18:54,047 --> 00:18:57,247
One of those news guys from the States.

143
00:19:01,755 --> 00:19:05,092
Scheduled for 10am at the White House.

144
00:19:05,192 --> 00:19:09,687
On the crime front, the police of 9 western
states, from Washington in the north

145
00:19:09,787 --> 00:19:11,626
to Colorado and Utah in the east,

146
00:19:11,726 --> 00:19:13,980
have been alerted to keep a continue search

147
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,880
for Kansas desperado, Emmet Myers.

148
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,777
Reports have placed the killer in Florida,
Detroit and Seattle,

149
00:19:21,877 --> 00:19:26,825
although the police have discounted
most of these. His latest victim,

150
00:19:26,925 --> 00:19:30,597
William Johnson, a salesman
from Portland, Oregon,

151
00:19:30,697 --> 00:19:34,336
was found late yesterday
in Imperial County, California.

152
00:19:34,436 --> 00:19:38,712
The victim's car, possibly with Myers
in it, has not yet been found.

153
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:42,914
- The United Nations...
- Shut it off.

154
00:19:44,906 --> 00:19:47,400
They're not even close!

155
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,918
You guys don't have to worry.

156
00:19:50,018 --> 00:19:52,015
Not yet.

157
00:19:52,255 --> 00:19:55,739
You can start sweating
when they put me in this car...

158
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:57,939
If they ever do.

159
00:20:01,686 --> 00:20:05,361
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
Sam Hayes reporting.

160
00:20:05,461 --> 00:20:07,300
At the top of the news tonight
there's a report

161
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,049
that Hitch-hike murderer,
Emmet Myers, is still at large.

162
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:12,049
Yesterday, the devil thumbed another ride

163
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:17,018
and William Johnson of Portland
asked him to hop in. Now, he is dead.

164
00:20:17,118 --> 00:20:18,962
In an all-out effort to apprehend Myers,

165
00:20:19,062 --> 00:20:22,337
the police have set up roadblocks
on all major highways of the western states,

166
00:20:22,437 --> 00:20:24,976
and all border stations
are being closely watched.

167
00:20:25,076 --> 00:20:29,011
Myers is slight, 28 years of age,
is wearing a dark shirt,

168
00:20:29,111 --> 00:20:31,950
dark grey trousers
and a black leather jacket.

169
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,882
His right eyelid is partially paralysed.

170
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,083
If you are in possession of any information

171
00:20:36,183 --> 00:20:38,221
regarding the whereabouts of this individual,

172
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:40,555
please communicate
with your nearest office of police

173
00:20:40,655 --> 00:20:43,855
or office of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

174
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:56,269
Pull up.

175
00:21:01,532 --> 00:21:03,056
Keys.

176
00:21:06,927 --> 00:21:08,417
Out.

177
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,421
Move.

178
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,581
Each of you take one.

179
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:38,617
Get around the car.

180
00:21:41,027 --> 00:21:43,632
We'll camp here tonight.

181
00:21:53,681 --> 00:21:56,216
I know what you're thinking, Collins.

182
00:21:56,456 --> 00:21:59,101
You haven't got a chance.

183
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:06,267
You guys are gonna die, that's all.
It's just a question of when.

184
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:10,908
Santa Rosalia, that's the end of the line.

185
00:22:11,148 --> 00:22:14,296
If the cops find out we're together

186
00:22:14,636 --> 00:22:17,515
or if you try to cross me up...

187
00:22:24,187 --> 00:22:29,368
You know, you make
pretty good targets from where I sit.

188
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,554
Anyway, you couldn't tell
if I was awake or asleep.

189
00:22:35,489 --> 00:22:38,001
I've one bum eye.

190
00:22:38,101 --> 00:22:40,943
It won't stay closed.

191
00:22:41,283 --> 00:22:43,789
Pretty good, huh?

192
00:23:48,542 --> 00:23:51,039
We're getting out here and buy some grub.

193
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:53,078
We get out of the car like usual.

194
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:55,692
You guys go in the store ahead of me.

195
00:23:55,792 --> 00:23:58,531
No Mexican. I'm talking to you.

196
00:23:58,631 --> 00:24:02,447
When he tells you how much, you pay.
Is that clear?

197
00:24:02,547 --> 00:24:05,722
One other thing.
I'll have my hand in my pocket.

198
00:24:05,822 --> 00:24:09,557
So far, my record in Mexico's clean,
I wanna keep it that way.

199
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,467
Let's go.

200
00:24:19,027 --> 00:24:21,227
Buenos días, señores.

201
00:24:35,546 --> 00:24:37,805
Buenos días, señores. Provisiones?

202
00:24:37,905 --> 00:24:41,481
Tengo un gran surtido de frutas y legumbres

203
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:43,455
al mismo precio que existen en Tijuana.

204
00:24:43,555 --> 00:24:44,956
What did he say about Tijuana?

205
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:47,994
He says their prices
are about the same as in Tijuana.

206
00:24:48,094 --> 00:24:50,571
Never mind the kid.

207
00:24:52,011 --> 00:24:54,550
- What do you want?
- Some beans and stuff.

208
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,550
And tomato soup. I like that.
Get four cans.

209
00:24:58,088 --> 00:25:02,816
He wants four cans of beans
and tomato soup, three cans of chilli.

210
00:25:03,397 --> 00:25:05,649
It's no use. He doesn't
understand English.

211
00:25:05,749 --> 00:25:10,649
You're not talking Mexican. Take
the cans. Give them to Collins.

212
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,808
I can take some more.

213
00:25:32,141 --> 00:25:34,330
Go on, load it up.

214
00:25:35,997 --> 00:25:38,716
That'll hold us. Pay him.

215
00:25:39,935 --> 00:25:43,591
Quince pesos, diez centavos, señor.

216
00:25:51,314 --> 00:25:54,834
Dame una manzana. Dame una manzana.

217
00:25:54,934 --> 00:25:57,436
Dame una manzana.

218
00:26:00,428 --> 00:26:02,672
Get her away from me.

219
00:26:04,642 --> 00:26:07,296
Put the kid down. Let's get
outta here. Come on, Collins.

220
00:26:07,396 --> 00:26:10,496
Hasta luego señores. Muchas gracias.

221
00:26:14,191 --> 00:26:16,464
Vaya usted con Dios.

222
00:26:16,604 --> 00:26:18,943
- What did you say to her?
- You wouldn't understand.

223
00:26:19,043 --> 00:26:21,343
What did you say to her?

224
00:26:22,882 --> 00:26:25,843
I said, "Go you with God, little one".

225
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:45,114
Get in.

226
00:26:47,011 --> 00:26:48,409
Hey, mister.

227
00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:53,350
You live in El Centro. I live there
some time. Nice place, huh?

228
00:28:05,003 --> 00:28:07,339
Where'd you get the watch, Bowen?

229
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,282
My wife gave it to me.

230
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:12,295
Throw it over here.

231
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:20,624
Didn't you hear me?
I told you to throw it over here.

232
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:42,254
I had a watch like this once, when I was 17.

233
00:28:43,594 --> 00:28:45,571
Nobody gave it to me.

234
00:28:45,671 --> 00:28:47,387
I took it.

235
00:28:47,487 --> 00:28:52,523
I knocked off a broken-down
jewellery store outside of Tulsa.

236
00:28:53,863 --> 00:28:55,884
It was a cinch.

237
00:28:57,224 --> 00:28:59,872
You guys are soft.

238
00:29:02,888 --> 00:29:05,385
You know what makes you that way?

239
00:29:06,425 --> 00:29:09,102
You're up to your necks in IOUs.

240
00:29:10,442 --> 00:29:12,980
You're suckers.

241
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,944
You're scared to get out on your own.

242
00:29:16,044 --> 00:29:19,099
You always had it good, so you're soft.

243
00:29:20,838 --> 00:29:22,965
Well, not me.

244
00:29:24,022 --> 00:29:26,518
Nobody ever gave me anything.

245
00:29:26,618 --> 00:29:29,297
So I don't owe nobody.

246
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:33,732
My folks were duff.

247
00:29:33,832 --> 00:29:36,487
When I was born,
they took one look at this...

248
00:29:36,587 --> 00:29:39,526
puss of mine and told me to get lost.

249
00:29:39,626 --> 00:29:43,729
I didn't need 'em.
I didn't need any of em.

250
00:29:44,169 --> 00:29:47,355
I got what I wanted my own way.

251
00:29:48,895 --> 00:29:51,913
When you get the know-how
and a few bucks in your pocket,

252
00:29:52,013 --> 00:29:55,913
you can buy anything or... anybody.

253
00:29:56,809 --> 00:30:02,349
Especially if they're at the point
of a gun. That really scares 'em.

254
00:30:03,021 --> 00:30:05,794
You ever been at the other end of a gun?

255
00:30:06,195 --> 00:30:09,695
No. And I never will be.

256
00:30:13,485 --> 00:30:16,288
I'm gonna listen to the news.

257
00:30:32,286 --> 00:30:34,483
Turn it up.
We'd like to hear what's going on.

258
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:39,683
You just get the grub ready.
Anything interesting, I'll let you know.

259
00:30:41,312 --> 00:30:45,666
We've got to raise the hood
and put that radio out of commission.

260
00:30:46,306 --> 00:30:49,203
When he finds out they're looking
for us together, we're through.

261
00:30:49,303 --> 00:30:54,676
- Never mind the radio. We gotta get him.
- You can't beat him that way.

262
00:30:54,776 --> 00:30:57,370
Give him one good reason and he'll kill us.

263
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:59,009
We gotta take the chance.

264
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:02,742
As long as he needs us, we'll stay alive.

265
00:31:02,843 --> 00:31:06,378
When he's ready to jump us,
we'll jump him. Not before.

266
00:31:06,478 --> 00:31:08,900
Maybe today, maybe tomorrow.

267
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,525
All right, now.

268
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,474
They've found Johnson's car.

269
00:31:22,269 --> 00:31:24,767
They know I'm in Mexico.

270
00:31:25,716 --> 00:31:30,432
And they're looking for you, too,
in the Chocolate Mountains.

271
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,493
Where are the Chocolate Mountains?

272
00:31:34,568 --> 00:31:37,014
- In Arizona, near home.
- Not in Mexico?

273
00:31:37,114 --> 00:31:38,635
No.

274
00:31:41,061 --> 00:31:43,647
Well, what d'you know?

275
00:31:44,963 --> 00:31:47,787
That's where you told your wives
you were going, uh?

276
00:31:47,988 --> 00:31:50,588
Then you came to Mexico.

277
00:31:51,966 --> 00:31:54,083
What for?

278
00:31:54,723 --> 00:31:56,121
Dames?

279
00:31:57,761 --> 00:32:00,778
You boys oughta be ashamed of yourselves.

280
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:04,774
Causing all that trouble, telling lies.

281
00:32:05,932 --> 00:32:10,087
You've got everybody looking
for you in them mountains.

282
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:25,728
- I told you, turn the radio on.
- I did.

283
00:32:25,868 --> 00:32:28,422
It takes time to warm up.

284
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:32,112
Try another station.

285
00:32:35,393 --> 00:32:38,673
- Stop it. Stop it!
- I can't. I gotta pull up and disconnect it.

286
00:32:38,773 --> 00:32:40,767
Then pull up!

287
00:32:52,715 --> 00:32:56,263
Come on, raise the hood.
And keep your hands on it.

288
00:32:59,308 --> 00:33:01,626
Come on, Collins, get to work.

289
00:33:01,726 --> 00:33:04,164
Get the right one the first time.

290
00:33:05,903 --> 00:33:08,224
Don't pull the radio wire!

291
00:33:16,227 --> 00:33:18,390
Faster, faster!
I thought you were a mechanic.

292
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:21,283
I'm going as fast as I can.

293
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,686
Watch it.

294
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,849
Come on.

295
00:33:58,634 --> 00:34:01,158
Throw the tools in the back.

296
00:34:16,497 --> 00:34:19,475
The radio, remember? Make it work.

297
00:34:22,948 --> 00:34:25,014
I can't.

298
00:34:26,721 --> 00:34:28,525
Pull up.

299
00:34:30,177 --> 00:34:33,123
So you did bust it, Collins.

300
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:38,166
Cut it out! He didn't do it.
It's the static in the hills.

301
00:34:38,266 --> 00:34:40,726
The stations aren't strong enough
in the daytime, tonight it'll work.

302
00:34:40,826 --> 00:34:44,426
Tonight it'd better. Take the wheel.

303
00:34:46,698 --> 00:34:49,775
Now, in Punta Prieta,

304
00:34:49,875 --> 00:34:52,675
in August 7th, three Americans stopped

305
00:34:52,775 --> 00:34:56,514
for provisions at a store
owned by José Andrade.

306
00:34:56,614 --> 00:35:00,881
Andrade gave a description of Myers
as being one of them.

307
00:35:00,981 --> 00:35:04,475
Another witness stated
that three men left the store

308
00:35:04,575 --> 00:35:08,650
and drove away in a green sedan
bearing the same plates.

309
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:12,186
This confirms our theory that Collins
and Bowen are with him.

310
00:35:12,286 --> 00:35:16,125
He seems to be heading south,
staying clear of main highways.

311
00:35:16,225 --> 00:35:19,815
Exactly. To the west,
this is more or less barren

312
00:35:19,915 --> 00:35:22,254
and would afford no means of escape.

313
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:27,690
His most logical move would be Santa Rosalia.

314
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:31,573
Then Guaymas.

315
00:35:32,401 --> 00:35:36,863
Make sure that fire's out.
Pour the coffee on it.

316
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,618
Get down!

317
00:35:49,841 --> 00:35:53,417
I've gotta get a closer look at that car.
On your feet.

318
00:35:53,557 --> 00:35:57,795
Through there.
At the other end, lie flat. Get going!

319
00:36:32,194 --> 00:36:35,487
- Get a move on!
- Are you trying to wreck it?

320
00:36:35,587 --> 00:36:37,587
Drive like I tell you.

321
00:36:57,411 --> 00:36:59,397
Out!

322
00:37:03,153 --> 00:37:08,269
- What did I tell you?
- Shut up! Get that spare tyre out. Move!

323
00:37:27,405 --> 00:37:31,725
Keep working. Keep your traps shut,
no matter what. I'll be watching.

324
00:37:44,171 --> 00:37:46,206
Buenos días, señores.

325
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:50,006
Son Americanos? Do you need any help?

326
00:37:50,707 --> 00:37:55,007
Que raro, no me contestan. Bueno, vámos!

327
00:38:00,469 --> 00:38:02,762
The search for Gilbert Bowen and Roy Collins,

328
00:38:02,862 --> 00:38:06,400
believed to have been last seen
with Emmet Myers, mass killer,

329
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,689
is being stepped up by the hour.

330
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:11,790
Helicopters are working in shifts,
scouring the entire area

331
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,728
from El Centro south
to the Gulf of California.

332
00:38:14,828 --> 00:38:17,562
The planes are maintaining
close liaison with the ground,

333
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:20,101
reporting isolated cars and campers.

334
00:38:20,201 --> 00:38:24,945
The Mexican police have now joined
this strange race against death.

335
00:40:41,295 --> 00:40:43,480
Hold it right there.

336
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:48,318
Around.

337
00:40:59,194 --> 00:41:01,374
Break the lock.

338
00:41:23,743 --> 00:41:26,568
Okay, one of you on the pump.

339
00:42:14,386 --> 00:42:19,265
"Maudie and Gilbert Bowen".

340
00:42:19,566 --> 00:42:23,266
Mayo 12 del '41.

341
00:42:23,631 --> 00:42:26,328
Sí, sí, pronto.

342
00:42:26,868 --> 00:42:30,994
Now, as you will notice,
when interrogated at the road block,

343
00:42:31,094 --> 00:42:33,538
the man and his wife
were very definite in their statement

344
00:42:33,638 --> 00:42:37,577
that they only saw two men.
This was below El Arco.

345
00:42:37,677 --> 00:42:40,714
There is a point, however,
which we feel is of importance.

346
00:42:40,814 --> 00:42:44,346
The couple stated that the behaviour
of the men seemed strange.

347
00:42:44,446 --> 00:42:46,385
That they refused to talk to them.

348
00:42:46,485 --> 00:42:52,001
It's possible that Myers my have
been concealed nearby, covering them.

349
00:42:52,101 --> 00:42:54,150
We'll consider that possibility.

350
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:57,968
Now, on the assumption that Myers
is listening to the radio,

351
00:42:58,068 --> 00:43:00,207
we're issuing these broadcasts in the state,

352
00:43:00,307 --> 00:43:02,692
containing false information
as to his whereabouts

353
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:04,793
and not connecting the two men with him.

354
00:43:04,893 --> 00:43:08,693
We'd appreciate your cooperation
and following the same procedure.

355
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,270
- This ought to be the main highway.
- It isn't.

356
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:31,910
- What do you mean?
- Looks like an abandoned airstrip.

357
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:35,310
It's okay for tonight. Get over there.

358
00:43:43,026 --> 00:43:46,051
- No, you're wrong, you're wrong!
- It's no use to try to talk me out of it.

359
00:43:46,151 --> 00:43:48,090
- Tonight I'm gonna chance it.
- You're out of your mind!

360
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:51,165
I've played it your way long enough.
From now on we're each on our own.

361
00:43:51,265 --> 00:43:53,104
It's no good, we've got to stay together.

362
00:43:53,204 --> 00:43:56,269
I've got a break I'm gonna take it,
you do whatever you want...

363
00:45:45,141 --> 00:45:48,089
Across the runway, there's trees.

364
00:45:58,678 --> 00:46:00,685
Keep going!

365
00:46:16,078 --> 00:46:20,715
- You guys are really dumb.
- Why, you dirty...

366
00:46:22,709 --> 00:46:25,326
You thought I was asleep, huh?

367
00:46:26,266 --> 00:46:28,827
You're beginning to get ideas...

368
00:46:28,927 --> 00:46:31,227
I don't like that.

369
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:33,741
Load him in the car.

370
00:46:33,841 --> 00:46:37,060
Your buddy's all washed up for tonight.

371
00:47:17,304 --> 00:47:19,323
Over there.

372
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:23,023
Move!

373
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,018
You, Collins, throw a rock down that shaft.

374
00:47:52,984 --> 00:47:55,129
Nice and deep.

375
00:48:05,707 --> 00:48:06,999
This is fine.

376
00:48:07,099 --> 00:48:09,434
Cut it out! If you're gonna kill us,
do it and get it over with.

377
00:48:09,534 --> 00:48:12,138
I thought you never killed without a reason.

378
00:48:12,238 --> 00:48:16,274
Go get the rest of the canned goods
out of the car.

379
00:48:16,374 --> 00:48:19,074
We'll have a real good meal.

380
00:48:57,647 --> 00:49:01,174
Save 'em for the next guy that picks you up.

381
00:49:02,946 --> 00:49:05,185
Anything you say.

382
00:49:05,825 --> 00:49:08,178
We interrupt this hour of music
to bring you a flash bulletin.

383
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:12,113
The Californian and Mexican police
have abandoned their theory

384
00:49:12,213 --> 00:49:13,907
that Emmet Myers is connected

385
00:49:14,007 --> 00:49:18,111
with the disappearance
of Gilbert Bowen and Roy Collins.

386
00:49:18,546 --> 00:49:22,443
They have been missing since last Sunday,
supposedly on a fishing trip.

387
00:49:22,543 --> 00:49:24,797
The police of both sides
of the border now feel

388
00:49:24,897 --> 00:49:26,698
that Myers is travelling alone

389
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:28,999
and has apparently abandoned his intention

390
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:33,199
of seeking escape by way of Santa Rosalia.

391
00:49:37,128 --> 00:49:40,035
What d'you know?!

392
00:49:40,135 --> 00:49:43,035
This kind of changes my plans.

393
00:49:44,222 --> 00:49:47,452
Looks like you and me
are going fishing after all.

394
00:49:49,571 --> 00:49:53,211
On your feet. Back to the car. Let's go.

395
00:49:54,447 --> 00:49:56,523
We're not going anyplace.

396
00:49:57,663 --> 00:49:59,427
Stand up!

397
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:13,556
- What did you do to it?
- There's a big hole in that crankcase.

398
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:21,623
All right, we'll walk.

399
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:27,008
Just what that sore ankle of yours needs,
Collins, a nice, long hike.

400
00:50:34,172 --> 00:50:35,956
Get up!

401
00:50:40,272 --> 00:50:43,809
Now get the fishing gear
out of the back. Move!

402
00:51:16,534 --> 00:51:19,379
Stay with it.
He'll never leave you out here alive.

403
00:51:19,479 --> 00:51:22,298
- Yeah.
- Cut the gab.

404
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:37,097
Get down!

405
00:51:46,418 --> 00:51:48,150
Let's get going.

406
00:51:54,307 --> 00:51:56,610
Maybe we'll have to leave you here.

407
00:51:57,111 --> 00:51:59,211
Too bad.

408
00:52:02,956 --> 00:52:05,277
Come on, Roy, try.

409
00:53:03,821 --> 00:53:07,517
Here we are! Here we are!

410
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:10,182
Can't you see us?

411
00:53:11,214 --> 00:53:15,368
Look! Here we are! Down here.

412
00:53:15,696 --> 00:53:19,170
Oh, please, God! Hear me!

413
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:21,530
Hear me!

414
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:26,118
Come back! Come back.

415
00:53:33,745 --> 00:53:37,809
Leave him alone.
Can't you see he's praying?

416
00:54:45,339 --> 00:54:47,483
Get under the bridge, quick!

417
00:55:10,071 --> 00:55:11,989
Relax.

418
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:36,624
Go ahead if you can stand that filthy stuff.

419
00:55:51,704 --> 00:55:55,777
You know, Collins?
You're just about my size.

420
00:55:55,877 --> 00:55:59,295
Put you in a black shirt and dark pants...

421
00:55:59,395 --> 00:56:01,895
with a leather jacket...

422
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:05,551
you'd look just like Emmet Myers,

423
00:56:05,651 --> 00:56:08,431
to anyone who never saw him.

424
00:56:09,071 --> 00:56:12,243
And nobody in Santa Rosalia ever saw him.

425
00:56:14,074 --> 00:56:16,040
Let's change.

426
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:24,808
Get up on the bank and take your clothes off.

427
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,305
Come on, get up!

428
00:58:01,947 --> 00:58:04,883
- Looks great, doesn't it?
- You won't be there long.

429
00:58:04,983 --> 00:58:09,374
Collins! There are cops down there.
In those clothes, they might shoot you.

430
00:58:09,714 --> 00:58:12,531
That'd solve your problems, wouldn't it?

431
00:58:12,631 --> 00:58:15,970
Not if they found they made a mistake.

432
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:18,963
We'll hit a joint on the outskirts.

433
00:58:19,063 --> 00:58:23,163
I might even buy you boys a beer.
Get moving.

434
00:58:30,495 --> 00:58:34,945
- Buenas tardes, señores.
- Buenas tardes. Give us three beers.

435
00:58:35,385 --> 00:58:37,982
Yo no hablo Inglés.

436
00:58:38,722 --> 00:58:40,656
He doesn't speak English.

437
00:58:40,756 --> 00:58:43,237
- Tres cervezas.
- Sí, sí.

438
00:58:43,337 --> 00:58:46,255
When I want you to talk Mex, I'll tell you.

439
00:58:46,355 --> 00:58:50,255
Sit down, Collins. Rest your sore foot.

440
00:58:53,574 --> 00:58:56,724
You can talk it now.
Ask about the ferry to Guaymas.

441
00:58:56,824 --> 00:59:01,960
I'll be watching his face.
If he looks frightened, I shoot.

442
00:59:03,061 --> 00:59:05,461
Cuándo sale el chalana para Guaymas?

443
00:59:06,662 --> 00:59:09,844
Los martes y viernes a las 9 de la noche

444
00:59:09,944 --> 00:59:12,802
Friday, that's today,
and Tuesday, 9 o'clock.

445
00:59:12,902 --> 00:59:16,667
- Ask him where we catch it.
- Dónde puedo embarcar?

446
00:59:16,767 --> 00:59:19,268
En el muelle.
Pero ahora no pueden embarcarse,

447
00:59:19,368 --> 00:59:23,268
porque el mes pasado se quemó
y lo están reparando en Guaymas.

448
00:59:24,786 --> 00:59:30,643
You're out of luck. The ferry burned up.
It's being repaired in Guaymas.

449
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,876
You're lying.

450
00:59:33,416 --> 00:59:35,395
Ask if he knows anyone who speaks English.

451
00:59:35,495 --> 00:59:39,395
Yo no hablo bien español, no comprendo.

452
00:59:40,596 --> 00:59:42,297
Usted no habla Inglés?

453
00:59:42,397 --> 00:59:46,120
Yo no, pero mi primo José, sí.
Venga conmigo.

454
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:48,955
He says his cousin speaks English,
follow him.

455
00:59:49,055 --> 00:59:50,152
Up.

456
00:59:50,255 --> 00:59:53,955
José! Levántate, despierta!

457
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:59,297
- José, José, despierta!
- Que pasó?

458
00:59:59,397 --> 01:00:02,097
Estos americanos quieren hablar contigo.

459
01:00:03,398 --> 01:00:07,998
Los dejo aquí con mi primo.
Si algo necesitan... confianza.

460
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:14,289
What can I do for you?

461
01:00:14,389 --> 01:00:16,661
We wanna find out about the ferry to Guaymas.

462
01:00:16,761 --> 01:00:18,961
You wanna go fishing?

463
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:23,476
Too bad. No ferry more for
the next two months maybe.

464
01:00:23,576 --> 01:00:25,776
- She burned up.
- Thank you.

465
01:00:26,015 --> 01:00:31,203
Fishing is good here. Not as good
as Guaymas or La Paz, but okay.

466
01:00:31,303 --> 01:00:34,581
- You have motor boat?
- You know someone who has a boat?

467
01:00:34,681 --> 01:00:39,936
Sure, sure. My friend Jaime,
he have one. Motor runs good.

468
01:00:40,036 --> 01:00:42,768
- How do we get to this Jaime?
- In the mine, where he works.

469
01:00:42,868 --> 01:00:45,669
- Let's go.
- He's not finished until six.

470
01:00:45,769 --> 01:00:49,669
- I'll fix it for you tomorrow morning.
- I wanna go now.

471
01:00:50,646 --> 01:00:54,143
- At six, then.
- By the time he gets the boat ready,

472
01:00:54,243 --> 01:00:56,243
there is no sun.

473
01:00:57,833 --> 01:01:01,649
My friend does not like using
too much boat at night.

474
01:01:03,728 --> 01:01:09,281
- He sees his wife and kids only at night.
- Give him some more.

475
01:01:09,521 --> 01:01:11,179
- For me?
- Yeah.

476
01:01:11,319 --> 01:01:13,618
- You pay my friend too?
- Yeah.

477
01:01:13,758 --> 01:01:18,917
You be at pier at 8.30.
The name of the boat is Estrella.

478
01:01:20,695 --> 01:01:23,196
A thousand thanks, señor.

479
01:01:24,886 --> 01:01:26,824
Good.

480
01:01:28,161 --> 01:01:33,203
We'll go to town and wait
by the water till dark. Let's go.

481
01:02:09,488 --> 01:02:13,085
- Hold it a minute, will you?
- Hang on.

482
01:02:41,251 --> 01:02:43,875
Better go fishing when you've got the chance.

483
01:02:43,975 --> 01:02:47,075
That's what you
came down here for, wasn't it?

484
01:02:48,166 --> 01:02:50,988
You guys are really fools.

485
01:02:52,228 --> 01:02:55,673
If you wanted, one of you
would have got away.

486
01:02:55,773 --> 01:03:00,888
But you kept thinking about each other.
So you missed some chances.

487
01:03:01,028 --> 01:03:04,551
You got tired. You slowed down.

488
01:03:05,745 --> 01:03:08,100
Now it's pretty late.

489
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:11,332
Yeah, tomorrow I'll be in Guaymas.

490
01:03:12,643 --> 01:03:16,449
Too bad you're not making
the whole trip with me.

491
01:03:17,089 --> 01:03:20,091
That'd be kinda silly, wouldn't it?

492
01:03:24,758 --> 01:03:27,395
You stink, Myers!

493
01:03:27,495 --> 01:03:30,795
You smell. Just like your clothes.

494
01:03:30,935 --> 01:03:33,410
Sure, you'll get to Guaymas,

495
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:38,048
but they'll catch up with you
and put you out of your misery.

496
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:42,500
You haven't got a chance.
You haven't got a thing except that gun.

497
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:44,492
You'd better hang on to it,

498
01:03:44,592 --> 01:03:46,893
because without it, you're nothing.

499
01:03:46,993 --> 01:03:50,393
- You're finished!
- Shut up!

500
01:03:53,368 --> 01:03:55,404
Gracias, Carlos.

501
01:04:04,990 --> 01:04:06,794
Caramba!

502
01:04:08,887 --> 01:04:12,349
Pronto! Llame la policía!
Este hombre está en la cantina de mi primo!

503
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:16,350
Se va esta noche en la estrella!
El barco de mi amigo Jaime!

504
01:04:16,450 --> 01:04:20,150
No Carlos, no estoy borracho!
Llame a la policía!

505
01:04:21,632 --> 01:04:26,625
Bueno. La policía. No, no, no, la policía!

506
01:04:57,450 --> 01:04:59,398
Hold it.

507
01:05:06,959 --> 01:05:11,522
All right, Collins. Now you get
to take a nice walk all by yourself.

508
01:05:11,622 --> 01:05:15,222
Down the alley and out on the dock.
Me and Bowen will follow.

509
01:05:15,322 --> 01:05:18,161
If you try to tip anyone off,
I'll let Bowen have it.

510
01:05:18,261 --> 01:05:22,525
You wouldn't want that, would you?
Get going.

511
01:06:24,934 --> 01:06:26,815
Go ahead, Collins.

512
01:06:26,915 --> 01:06:30,622
All the way out. Keep under the lights.

513
01:08:07,063 --> 01:08:10,279
Alto!

514
01:08:10,379 --> 01:08:12,596
Alto ahí!

515
01:08:12,697 --> 01:08:16,097
I'm not Myers! I'm not Myers!

516
01:08:16,736 --> 01:08:19,712
D'you hear me? I'm not Myers!

517
01:08:27,415 --> 01:08:29,819
Alto! Alto!

518
01:08:35,747 --> 01:08:38,147
