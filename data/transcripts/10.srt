25.000

3
00:02:09,713 --> 00:02:15,677
Look Mr. Connell. I just can't aford to be without
work. I've got a mother and two kid sisters.

4
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,054
More Good-luck telegrams...

5
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,850
You know how it is. I've just got to keep on working,
see?

6
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:27,689
Sorry sister. I was sent down here to clean house. I
told you I can't use your column anymore.

7
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:35,905
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get 30 dollars a week. I'll
take 25, 20 if necessary. I'll do anything you say

8
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:41,870
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. We need
fireworks.

9
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,457
I can do that. I know this town inside and out. Oh,
give me a chance!

10
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,334
Come in, come in, come in...

11
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:52,839
Cashier's got your check. Who are these people?
Gabs, Connie, Fonygan and Chiles...

12
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:57,844
Hey sister, don't forget to get out your last column
before you pick up your check.

13
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,452
Big, rich slob like D.B. Norten buys the paper and 40
heads are chopped off!

14
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,414
- Did you get it too?
- Yeah, you too?

15
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:32,045
Oh Joe. I'm sorry darling. Why don't we tear the
building down.

16
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,215
Before you do ma'm, perhaps you'd better finish this
column.

17
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,259
Lavendar and Old Lace.

18
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,304
Wait Joe! Wait.

19
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,478
He want fireworks huh? Okay.

20
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,997
Here.

21
00:04:08,707 --> 00:04:14,421
Below is a letter which reached my desk this morning.
It's a commentary on what we call a civilized world.

22
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:20,468
Dear Miss Mitchell. Four years ago, I'd been fired out
of my job. Since then, I haven't been able to get a
new one.

23
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:27,392
At first I was sore at the administration, because of all
the politics here, we have all this unemployment.

24
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:35,108
But in looking around, it seems the whole world is
going to pot. So in protest, I am going to commit
suicide...

25
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:39,154
...by jumping of the City Hall roof. Signed a
disgusted, American citizen, John Doe.

26
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:44,659
Editor's note, if you ask this column, the wrong people
are jumping off the roofs.

27
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:50,040
- Hey, this is the old fake-a-roo,
- Never mind that Joe, go ahead.

28
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:16,149
And it's because of all the slimy politics that we have
all this unemployment here.

29
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,236
There it is. There's D.B. Norten's opening attack on
the Governor.

30
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:24,574
- Why Jim, it's just a letter sent into a column.
- No, no, I can smell him, that's Norten.

31
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,911
- Good-morning gentlemen.
- Good-morning Governor.

32
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,539
- Governor, did you happen to see this in the New
Bulletin?

33
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:35,877
- Yes, I had it served with my breakfast this morning.
- Jim thinks it's D.B. Norten at work...

34
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:36,961
Of course it is.

35
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:41,883
Oh come now. That little item. D.B. Norten does
things in a much bigger way

36
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:45,303
This is his opening attack on you Governor. Take my
word for it.

37
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:49,557
Why did he buy a paper for? Why did he engage a
high-pressure editor like Connell for? '

38
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,228
He's in the oil business. I tell you Governor, he's after
your scalp.

39
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:57,649
All right Jim. Don't burst a blood vessel. I'll look into
it.

40
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,319
- Yes sir?
- Get me Spenser of the Daily Chronical please.

41
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:11,746
Yes, yes I saw it Governor. And if you ask me, that's
a phony letter.

42
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:16,543
- Why that gag has got whiskers on it. Ok I'll get the
Mayor and maybe the Chamber of Commerce to go
after them.
- Sorry the Mayor is busy on the other phone.

43
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:21,756
Yes I know Mrs. Brewster, it's a terrible reflection on
our city. I've had a dozen calls already.

44
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:22,549
- Spencer from the Chronical.
- Hold him.

45
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,968
- Spencer from the Chronical.
- Hold him.

46
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,344
Yes Mrs. Brewster. I'm listening.

47
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:33,393
I insist that this John Doe be found, and given a job at
once. If something isn't done about it, I'll call the
whole auxiliary.

48
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:44,696
Yes Spencer? Who? The Governor? Well what
about me? It's my building he's jumping off of and I'm
up for re-election too.

49
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,948
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bullentin.

50
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,160
- He's liable to go right past my window
- Get me Connell.

51
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:51,327
- What was that?
- What?

52
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,872
- Out the window Something just flew by
- I didn't see anything.

53
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:56,666
Don't stand there you idiot. Go and look. Open the
window.

54
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,837
Oh why did he have to pick on my building? Is there
a crowd in the street?

55
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,466
- No sir!
- Maybe he's caught on the ledge, look again.

56
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:09,471
- I think it must have been a sea gull
- A sea gull? What's a sea gull doing around City
Hall?

57
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,933
- That's a bad omen, isn't it?
- Oh no sir. The sea gull is a lovely bird.

58
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:22,067
It's all right Mrs. Brewster. It was just a sea gull.
Nothing's happened yet. I'm watching. Don't worry
just leave it all to me.

59
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,904
Spencer, I'll call you back. Hello Connell?

60
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,782
This is... What are you doing? This is the Mayor.

61
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,702
Yes Mayor Lovitt, how many times are you going to
call me?

62
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,539
Got everybody out looking for him. Did you see the
blacks I'm running?

63
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:42,962
An appeal to John Doe. Think it over John. Life can
be beautiful, says Mayor.

64
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:46,716
If you need a job, apply to the editor of this paper and
so forth and so forth.

65
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,887
Okay Mayor. I'll let you know as soon as I have
something. What?

66
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,932
Well, pull down the blinds.

67
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:57,143
- I just came from Mrs. Mitchells house, and boy is
she in a bad way.
- Where is she?

68
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,189
- Did you know that she supports a mother and two
kids.
- What do you know about that?

69
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:05,151
Did you find her? No, her mother is awful worried
about her. When she left the house, she said she
was going on a roaring drunk!

70
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,946
- Go out and find her.
- Sure.

71
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:14,452
But the biggest thing I didn't tell you, is her old man is
Dr. Mitchell. You know the doc that saved my
mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it. You
remember that?

72
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,996
Okay boss, I'll go and look for her.

73
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:26,506
Holy smokes Commissionair, you've had 24 hours.
Okay, grab a pencil, here it is again.

74
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:35,348
About 5 foot 5, brown eyes, light chestnut hair, and a
fine of pair of legs as...

75
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,977
...ever walked into this office.

76
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:47,277
- Did you want to see me?
- No. I've had the whole army and navy out searching
for you because it's a game we play here everyday.

77
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:53,283
- I remember distinctly being fired.
- That's right, but you have a piece of paper that still
belongs to this paper.

78
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:54,534
- What's that?
- The letter.

79
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,369
- What letter?
- The letter from John Doe.

80
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,540
The whole town isin an uproar. We've got to find him
and the letter is the only clue.

81
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:05,545
- There is no letter.
- Then get a handwriting expert to... What?

82
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,797
There is no letter.

83
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:12,344
- Say that again.
- I made it up.

84
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,139
- You made it up?
- Yes, you said you wanted fireworks.

85
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:21,186
Don't you know there are 9 jobs waiting for this guy
22 families want to board him free.

86
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,898
Five women want to marry him and a man is ready to
adopt him.

87
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,276
- And you...
- Just called the ward boss and they said there's a
girl...

88
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:31,029
- Ann! Say why didn't you...
- Benny!

89
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,991
- Only one thing to do Hank. Drop the whole business
quickly
- How?

90
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:38,828
Run a story saying John Doe was in here and he was
sorry for writing the letter...

91
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,165
Sure. He came in here and we got him to change his
mind.

92
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,877
Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life. Why it's perfect.
I'll have Ned write it up.

93
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,838
- Oh Ned, I've got a story I want you...
- Wait a minute.

94
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,676
Listen you great, big, wonderful genius of a
newspaper man...

95
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:59,182
You came down here to shoot some life into this dying
paper, didn't you? Well the whole town is curious
about John Doe and just like that, you're going to bury
him.

96
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,851
There's enough cirrculation in that man to start an ink
shortage.

97
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,104
- In what man?
- John Doe.

98
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,774
- What John Doe?
- My John Doe! The one I made up.

99
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:13,196
Now look genius. Suppose there was a John Doe
and he walked into this ofice. What would you do?

100
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:17,992
Give him a job and forget about the whole business I
suppose huh? Not me! I'd make a deal with him.

101
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:19,244
A deal?

102
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:22,706
Sure, when you get hold of a stunt that sells papers,
you don't drop it like a hot potatoe.

103
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,916
Why this is good for at least a couple of months.
Why, do you know what I'd do?

104
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:31,297
Between now and let's say Christmas, when he's
going to jump, I'd run a daily starting with his
boyhood, schooling, firstjob.

105
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,970
Awide-eyed youngster facing a caotic world! The
problem of the average man, of all the John Doe's in
the world.

106
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:42,517
Now, then comes the drama. He meets
discouragement, he finds the world a feet of clay his
ideals crumble. So what does he do?

107
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,604
He decides to commit suicide and protest against the
state of civilization.

108
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:51,067
He thinks of the river but no. He has a better idea.
City Hall. But why?

109
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:56,281
Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to
get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way
he can get himself heard...

110
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:57,782
- So?
- So?

111
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:01,494
So he writes me a letter and I dig him up. He pours
out his soul to me.

112
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,833
And from now on we quote: I protest, by John Doe.
He protests against all the evils in the world.

113
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,879
The greed, the lust, the hate, the fear All of man's
inhumanities.

114
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:21,514
Arguments will start. Should he commit suicide, or
should he not? People will write in with pleading for
him. But John Doe will remain adament. On
Christmas Eve hot or cold, he goes!

115
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,475
See?

116
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:30,357
Very pretty indeed Miss Mitchell. But would you mind
telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?

117
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:32,317
- John Doe!
- What John Doe!?

118
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:37,280
- The one we hire for the job, you lunk-head.
- Wait a minute. Let me get this through this lame
brain of mine.

119
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:41,493
- Are you suggesting that we go out and hire someone
to say that he is going to commit suicide on Christmas
Eve?

120
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,995
- Now you're catching on.
- Who for example?

121
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:51,628
- Anybody, Benny will do.
- Sure... what, who me... jump of a... anytime but
Christmas.

122
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:02,597
Miss Mitchell, do me a favor. Go on out and get
married and have a lot of babies, but stay out of
newspaper business.

123
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:09,854
- Better get that story in Hank, it's getting late.
- You're suppose to be a smart guy If it was raining
100 dollar bills, you be out looking for a dime you lost
some place.

124
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:16,403
- Holy smokes. Wasting my time, listening to this mad
woman.
- Look Chief at what the Chronical is writing on John
Doe.

125
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:21,533
Why the no good! John Doe story amature
journalism.

126
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:26,496
It's probably phony and it's a wonder that anyone is
taking it seriously. What do you think of those guys?

127
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:34,295
That's fine! Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead.
Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing
off. You know what that's going to sound like on top
of this.

128
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,798
- That's all.
- All right.

129
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:45,640
- Amature journalism huh? Why those bunch of
sophomores, I can teach them more...
- Hey boss, get a load of this.

130
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,101
- What?
- Look.

131
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,316
- What do they want?
- They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.

132
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:58,361
- Oh, they all wrote the letter?
- Tell them all to wait.

133
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:05,285
Mr. Connell, one of those men is your John Doe.
They're desparate and will do anything for a cup of
coffee. Pick one out and you can make the Chronical
eat their words.

134
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:10,582
- I'm beginning to like this.
- If you ask me Hank, your beginning to play around
with dynomite.

135
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:17,505
No, no, no, the gal's right. Can't let the Chronicel get
the laugh on us. We've got to produce a John Doe
now. Amature journalism!!

136
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:24,054
- I'll show those guys.
- Sure, and there's no reason for them to find out the
truth, because naturally I won't say anything.

137
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,641
- Kay sister, you'll get yourjob back
- Plus a bonus.

138
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:33,438
- What bonus?
- Oh the bonus of 1000 dollars that the Chronicel was
going to pay me for this little document.

139
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:39,277
- You'll see it says, I Miss Mitchell,
- do hereby certify that the John Doe letter was
created by me... I can read, I can read.

140
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,237
Sorry...

141
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:46,201
- You think this is worth 1000 dollars do you?
- The Chronicel will consider it dirt cheap.

142
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:51,289
Packs everything, including a gun. Okay sister,
you've got yourself a deal.

143
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:57,337
Now let's take a look at the canidates. The one we
pick has got to be the typical average man. Typical,
American and can keep his mouth shut.

144
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,174
Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut,
and I'll eat him.

145
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,969
Okay Benny, bring them in, one at a time...

146
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,202
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?

147
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,830
- No, I didn't.
- Why are you here then?

148
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:18,043
Well the paper said there was some jobs around.
Thought there might be one left over.

149
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:21,588
- Have any schooling?
- Yeah, a little.

150
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:25,008
- What do you do when you work?
- I used to pitch.

151
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,469
- Baseball?
- Yeah.

152
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:31,514
- Where'd you play?
- Bush leagues, mostly

153
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:35,435
- How about family? Got any family?
- No.

154
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,565
- Oh, just travelling through huh?
- Yeah, me and a friend of mine. He's outside.

155
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:49,074
- He looks all right.
- Oh, he's perfect and a baseball player What could
be more American?

156
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:53,703
- Wish he had a family though.
- Be less complicated without a family His face is
wonderful.

157
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,331
They'll believe him! Come on.

158
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:03,088
- What's your name?
- Willaby. John Willaby they called me in baseball.

159
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:06,716
Would you like to make some money?

160
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:14,224
- Yeah... maybe...
- Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter and
stick by it.

161
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:24,150
I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.

162
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:32,826
- That's our man, he's made to order.
- I don't know. He doesn't seem like the kind of guy
that will fall in line.

163
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:38,289
When you're desparate for money, you'll do a lot of
things Mr. Connell. He's our man, I tell you...

164
00:16:39,624 --> 00:16:43,086
- He's fainted. Get some water, quickly
- Sit him up.

165
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,464
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

166
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,467
How many is that, six?

167
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,312
Pretty hungry, weren't you?

168
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:06,443
- All this John Doe business is batty if you ask me.
- Well, nobody asked you.

169
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:12,115
Trying to improve the world by jumping of buildings.
You couldn't improve the world, if the buildings
jumped on you.

170
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:16,870
- Don't mind him, he hates people.
- He likes you well enough to stick around.

171
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,372
That's cause we both play doo-hickies.

172
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:28,048
I met him in a boxcar a couple of years ago. I was
fooling around with my harmonica and he comes over
and joins in. I haven't been able to shake him since.

173
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:54,991
- All right boys, here he is.
- No, no, no, you can't take pictures of him like that,
eating a sandwich and with a beard.

174
00:17:55,575 --> 00:18:00,455
- But he's going to jump of a building.
- Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not
news. This man's going to jump as a matter of
principal.

175
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:04,376
- Maybe you're right.
- We'll clean him up, put him in a hotel under
bodyguards and make a mystery out of him.

176
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:10,548
- Did you speak to Mr. Norten?
- He thinks it's terrific. He says for us to go the limit.
Wants us to build a bonfire under every bigshot in the
state. Oh swell!

177
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,634
- Is that the contract?
- Yeah.

178
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,887
- What's he doing here?
- A friend of his, they play duets together

179
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,432
- Duets? But can we trust him?
- I trust him.

180
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:24,187
- Oh you trust him, well that's fine.
- I suppose he trusts you too. Oh stop it now He's all
right.

181
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:30,944
Okay, but we don't want any more than a couple on
this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy
of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.

182
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:36,574
- I've got it already here.
- That's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement.

183
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:41,746
It gives us an exclusive story under your name, day
by day, from now until Christmas.

184
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:47,168
On December 26, you get one railroad ticket, out of
town.

185
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:53,758
And they agree to have your arm fixed. That's what
you want, isn't it? Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone,
Set or Brown.

186
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,137
Here sign it. Meanwhile, here is 50 dollars, spending
money.

187
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:03,143
That's fine. Benny, take charge of him. Get him a
suite at the lmperial and some bodyguards.

188
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:06,980
- He needs some new clothes Benny.
- Do you think we'd better have him de-loused?

189
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:10,900
- Both of them?
- Yes, both of them, but don't let them out of your
sight.

190
00:19:11,401 --> 00:19:13,236
- Hey Benny, grey suit huh?
- Yeah.

191
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:15,530
Okay fellows...

192
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,996
Take it easy John Doe.

193
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:33,590
And you, start pounding that typewriter Oh boy this is
terrific. No responsibilites on our part, just statements
from John Doe and we can blast our heads of.

194
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:37,093
Before you pop your head off, don't forget to make
that check out for 1000.

195
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:45,977
You sit outside the door, to make sure no one comes
in. You two fellows sit in here.

196
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,480
Pretty nifty huh?

197
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,649
- He ain't going to get me to stay here.
- Sure you are.

198
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,986
No sir, that spot under the bridge, where we slept last
night, is good enough for me...

199
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,239
- Say, what do I do with this baggage?
- Stick them in the bedroom.

200
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,700
Give me mine, I ain't staying.

201
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:07,248
- You know we were headed for the Columbia River
Country before all this John Doe business came up,
don't you?
- Sure, I remember.

202
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,085
Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator?
Mine did.

203
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,339
Oh Long John, I tell you it's no good. You're going to
get used to a lot of stuf that's going to wreck you.

204
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:18,927
Why that 50 bucks in your pocket is beginning to
show up on you already...

205
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:24,974
- Stop worrying. I'm going to get my arm fixed out of
this.
- Hey, here are some cigars the boss sent us. Have
one.

206
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,268
- You?
- No.

207
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:39,239
Say I bet you the Major Leaguer's don't rate an outfit
like this.

208
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:44,786
- Here make yourself comfortable. Paper?
- I don't read no papers, and I don't listen to no radios
either.

209
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:48,790
I know the world has been shaved by a drunken
barber, and I don't have to read it.

210
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:58,800
I've seen guys like you go under before. Never had a
worry, then got a hold of some dough and went goofy.

211
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:01,594
- Hey did you get a load of the bedroom?
- No.

212
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:09,769
The first thing that happens to guys like that is he
wants to go into restaurants and sit down at a table
and eat salads and cupcakes and drink tea.

213
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:13,106
Boy what that kind of food does to your system.

214
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:26,953
The next thing the dope wants is a room. Yes sir, a
room with steam heat! And he can't sleep unless he
has a bed.

215
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,832
Hey stop worrying. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.

216
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:34,294
I've seen plenty of fellows start out with 50 bucks and
wind up with a bank account.

217
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:41,468
- What's the matter with a bank account?
- Let me tell you Long John that when you become a
guy with a bank account...

218
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,762
...they got you! Yes sir, they've got you.

219
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:47,932
- Who's got him?
- The Heelots!

220
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:52,437
Hey there's the City Hall's tower I'm suppose to jump
off of. It's even higher than this.

221
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:56,858
- Who's got him?
- The Heelots!

222
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:02,530
Hey, wait a minute! You're not suppose to jump until
Christmas Eve. Do you want to get me into a jam?

223
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:06,368
If it's going to get you in a jam, I'll do you a favor I
won'tjump.

224
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:12,957
- And when they've got you, you've got no more
chance than a road-rabbit.
- Who'd you say was going to get him?

225
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:17,045
- Hey is this one of those places where you ring if you
want something?
- Yeah, just use the phone.

226
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:19,339
Boy, I've always wanted to do this.

227
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:24,844
Look Doc, give me that again, will you? Who's going
to get him?

228
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:30,266
- The Heelots. Who are they?
- Listen sucky, ever been broke?

229
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,102
Sure, mostly often.

230
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:36,690
All right you're walking alone. Nota nickle In your
jeans, you're asfree as the wind, nobody bothers you.

231
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:45,365
Hundreds of people pass you by in every line of
business. Shoes, hats, automobiles, furniture,
everything. And they're all nice lovable people.

232
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:47,492
And they let you alone, is that right?

233
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:50,578
Then you get a hold of some dough, and what
happens?

234
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:56,376
All those sweet, lovable people become Heelots!

235
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:03,258
A lot of heels. They begin creeping up on you, trying
to sell you something. They get long claws...

236
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:09,973
. then they get a strangle-hold on you. And you squirm
and you duck and you holler and you try to push them
away, but you haven't got a chance. They've got you!

237
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:17,063
First thing you know, you own things. A car for
instance. Now your whole life is messed up with a lot
more stuff.

238
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:23,820
You get license fees, and number plates, and gas, oil,
taxes, insurance...

239
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:34,247
...and identifcation cards, and letters and bills and then
flat tires, dents and trafic tickets and a million and
one other things.

240
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,083
And what happens?

241
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:45,216
You're not the free and happy guy you used to be.
You've got to have money to pay for all those things.

242
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:49,763
So you go after what the other fellow's got. And there
you are, you're a Heelot yourself.

243
00:23:57,896 --> 00:24:08,073
- You win, here take the 50. Go on, get rid of it.
- You bet I will, just as fast as I can. I'm going to get
some canned goods, a fishing rod and the rest, I'm
going to give away.

244
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:12,660
- Give away?!
- Hey, get me a pitcher's glove. I've got to get me
some practice.

245
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:19,501
- Say, he's giving it away. I'm going to get me some of
that.
- Hey come back here, you Heelot.

246
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:28,968
Will you send up 5 hamburgers with all the trimmings,
5 chocolate ice-cream sodas, and 5 pieces of apple
pie?

247
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:33,932
- No, apple, with cheese. Yep, thanks.

248
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,407
Hello there!

249
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:57,122
- Well, well, if it isn't the man about town.
- All set Miss Anne.

250
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:04,212
Oh yes, let's go. Let's see, we want some action in
these pictures.

251
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,506
- Action?
- Yes.

252
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:12,887
No, no! This man is going to jump of a roof. Wait a
minute. Let me comb your hair.

253
00:25:14,014 --> 00:25:15,724
Sit down.

254
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,563
There, that's better.

255
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:32,115
- You know, he's got a nice face, hasn't he?
- Yeah, he's pretty.

256
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,786
Here sit down. Quiet egg-head.

257
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:40,957
- All right, now a serious expression.
- Can't, I'm feeling too good.

258
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:44,711
Oh come on, this is serious. You're a man disgusted
with all of civilization...

259
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,922
- With all of it?
- Yes, you're sore at the world, come on now!

260
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:50,592
- Crabby guy huh?
- Yeah!

261
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:54,846
No, no!

262
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:58,224
No...

263
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:03,980
Now look, you don't have to smell the world.

264
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:09,110
- But all those guys in the pictures.
- Never mind those guys. All right, stand up.

265
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:13,031
- Now let's see what you look like, when you protest.
- Against what?

266
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:16,034
Against anything. Just protest.

267
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:18,912
You got me...

268
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:24,709
Look I'm the umpire. You just cut the heart of the
plate with your fast ball, and I called it a ball. What
would you do?

269
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:28,630
Why can't you call them right, you bone-headed...

270
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:35,220
I PROTEST!

271
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:42,936
AGAINST CORRUPTIOIN IN POLITICS

272
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:49,401
AGAINST COUNTRY HOSPITAL SHUTTING
DOORS TO NEEDY!

273
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:30,108
I don't care whose picture they're publishing. I still
say this John Doe person is a myth and you can
quote me on that.

274
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:43,038
And I'm going to insist on his being produced for
questioning. You know as well as I do, that this whole
thing is being engineered by a vicious man with a
vicious purpose Mr. D.B. Norten.

275
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:11,024
- Connell and Mitchell are at the house.
- Are they now? Come on.

276
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:17,864
Personally, I think it's just plain stupidity to drop it.
Now you should see his fan mail, thousands! This is
going over like a house on fire.

277
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:19,783
Personally, I think it's just plain stupidity to drop it.
Now you should see his fan mail, thousands! This is
going over like a house on fire.

278
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:29,626
- Why are you afraid of Connell? It's doubled our
circulation.
- Eah, but it's got everybody sore. Hands are bing
pulled. The Governor is starting a liable suit.

279
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:34,923
So let them see him. We'll go one better, they can
also hear him. You own a radio station Mr. Norten,
why not put him on the air?

280
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:40,929
Watch out for this dame D.B., she'll drive you batty
We can't let them get to this bush-league pitcher and
they start pumping him.

281
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:47,477
No telling what the screw-ball might do. I walk in
yesterday, and here he is standing on a table with a
fishing pole.'

282
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:53,149
- Ake my advice and get him out of town, before this
whole thing explodes in our faces.
- If you do that Mr. Norten, you're just as much of a
dumb-cluck as he is.

283
00:28:53,775 --> 00:28:55,443
You've got yourself a meal-ticket and you hate to let
him go.

284
00:28:56,069 --> 00:29:00,615
Sure he's a meal ticket and I admit it. But, it is also a
wind-fall for somebody like Mr. Norten who's trying to
crash National politics.

285
00:29:01,032 --> 00:29:06,454
That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it?
You want to reach a lot of people, don't you? Put
John Doe on the air, and you can reach 130 million of
them.

286
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:13,503
He can say anything he wants, and they'll listen to
him. All right, we'll forget the Governor and the Mayor
and all the small-fry like that. This can arouse
National interest.

287
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:19,384
If he made a hit around here, he could do every other
place in the country And you'll be pulling the strings
Mr. Norten.

288
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:25,557
- Go down to the office and arrange for some radio
time.
- But D.B. You're not going to fall...

289
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,851
I want it as soon as possible.

290
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:34,399
Okay, I just came in to get warm myself. Come on,
let's go.

291
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,319
Now don't you go, I want to talk to you.

292
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:46,995
Sit down.

293
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:06,639
- So, this John Doe idea was yours huh?
- Yes.

294
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:15,482
- How much money do you get?
- 30 dollars.

295
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:23,448
- Hirty dollars... What are you after, I mean what do
you want? Ajournalistic career?
- Money!

296
00:30:25,325 --> 00:30:28,370
Money, well I'm glad to hear somebody admit it.

297
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:35,960
Do you suppose you could write a radio speech for
that fellow and hold him to it?

298
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,756
- Oh, I'm sure I can. Do it and I'll give you 100 dollars
a week.
- 100 dollars?!

299
00:30:40,173 --> 00:30:45,053
That's only the beginning. You play your cards right,
and you'll never have to worry about money again.

300
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:47,639
- Oh I knew it.
- Hello.

301
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:52,310
- Whenever there's a pretty woman around... my
nephew Ted Sheldon.
- How do you do?

302
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:56,773
- How do you do?
- All right Casanova, I'll give you a break. See that
Miss Mitchell gets a car to take her home.

303
00:30:57,565 --> 00:31:01,361
- Always reading my mind, aren't you?
- Thank you very much for everything.

304
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:06,491
Oh Miss Mitchell. I think from now on, you'd better
work directly with me.

305
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,327
Yes sir.

306
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:47,323
I thought you were asleep.

307
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:54,497
- Oh you little brats! .
- Come, come, come children. It's past your bedtime.

308
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:02,630
I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.

309
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:07,052
- Oh yes you willAnne dear, you're very clever.
- Yes, I know.

310
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:10,055
- What are you looking for?
- Your purse, I need 10 dollars.

311
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:15,727
- What for, I gave you 50 just the other day
- Yes I know dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby
yesterday.

312
00:32:17,062 --> 00:32:21,733
- And there wasn't a thing in the house.
- And the community lady came. And the 50 is all
gone. Who is the 10 for?

313
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:23,860
- Websters...
- Websters.

314
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:30,617
You remember those lovely people your father used to
take care of. I thought I would buy them some
groceries. Oh Anne dear, it's a shame those...

315
00:32:31,201 --> 00:32:36,456
You're marvelous! You're just like father used to be.
Do you realize that a couple of weeks ago, we didn't
have enough to eat ourselves?

316
00:32:37,415 --> 00:32:41,044
Yes I know dear, but these people are in such need.

317
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:47,258
If you are thinking of that 1000 dollars forget it. It's
practically gone. We owed everybody in town. None
you've just got to stop giving your money away

318
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:54,140
- Oh Anne... I'm sorry.
- Don't pay any attention to me.

319
00:32:55,308 --> 00:33:03,024
Here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere.
To give us security for once in our lives and here I'm
stuck. If I can put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have
6 babies.

320
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:07,237
- You mean this speech you're writing.
- Yeah, I don't know. I just can't seem to get it to gel.

321
00:33:07,696 --> 00:33:16,621
I created somebody who's going to give up his life for
a principal. Hundreds of thousands of people are
going to listen to him over the radio. And unless he
says something that is sensational, well, it's just no
good.

322
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:24,629
Well honey, of course I don't know what kind of
speech you're tying to write, butjudging from the
samples I've read, I don't think anybody will listen.

323
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:26,548
What?

324
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:33,304
Darling, there's so many complaining political
speeches, people are tired of hearing of doom and
despair on a radio...

325
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:38,935
...lf you can have him say anything, why not have him
say something simple and real. Something with hope
in it.

326
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:44,190
If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.

327
00:33:44,524 --> 00:33:47,110
Yeah, Father certainly would.

328
00:33:49,112 --> 00:33:50,989
Wait a minute.

329
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:12,260
- That's your father's diary Anne
- Father's? I never knew he had a diary.

330
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:16,848
There's enough in it for 100 speeches. Things people
ought to hear now-a-days.

331
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:21,811
You be careful of it, won't you dear? It's always help
keep your father alive for me.

332
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:24,272
You bet I will Ma.

333
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,320
Wait a minute. John Doe don't want to sign no
autographs.

334
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:34,366
- What does he do all day?
- What does he do all day? He's writing all these
memories.

335
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:42,540
Sorry Eddie, you can't see Mr. Doe. He wants to be
alone. No, he just sits around all day and commutes
with himself.

336
00:35:00,308 --> 00:35:03,353
I don't know how you're going to stand it around here
until after Christmas?

337
00:35:07,565 --> 00:35:10,151
I bet you ain't heard a crying whistle in two weeks?

338
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:19,869
Strike!

339
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:34,759
I know why you are hanging around.

340
00:35:41,766 --> 00:35:43,977
You're stuck on the girl.

341
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:49,566
That's all a guy needs, is to get hooked up with a
woman.

342
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:10,754
- What was that, a single?
- First baseman dropped the ball.

343
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:13,798
Butter-fingers!

344
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:25,060
If a guy has a woman on his hands, first thing you
know, his life is balled up with a lot more things...

345
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:40,825
Did you get him?

346
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:43,119
- You're out!
- Swell.

347
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:45,997
- What's this, the end of the eighth?
- Ninth!

348
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,129
Hey Benny, there's a couple of mugs from the
Chroncel snooping around out here...

349
00:36:57,008 --> 00:36:59,052
Come on angel-face.

350
00:37:01,596 --> 00:37:04,641
What's the score angel-face? Three to two.

351
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:18,863
- Hey you've got swell form there.
- You must have been a pretty good pitcher Pretty
good? I was just about ready for the Major League,
when I chipped a bone in my elbow

352
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:22,075
- I got it pitching a 19 inning game.
- 19?

353
00:37:23,034 --> 00:37:27,038
There was a Major League scout there watching me
too. He came down, after the game, with a contract.

354
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:31,376
You know what? I couldn't lift my arm to sign it.

355
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:35,630
- I'll be Okay though, as soon as I get it fixed up.
- It's too bad.

356
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,844
- What do you mean too bad?
- Huh, or that's you'll never be able to play again.

357
00:37:41,803 --> 00:37:46,516
- What are you talking about, I just told you I was...
- Well you know how they are in baseball. If a guy is
messed up in a racket...

358
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:52,147
- A racket? What do you mean?
- I was just thinking about this John Doe business.

359
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:57,110
As soon as it comes out that it was all a fake, you'll be
washed up in baseball, won't you?

360
00:38:00,238 --> 00:38:03,283
Yeah...

361
00:38:04,117 --> 00:38:07,162
I never thought about that.

362
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:18,548
And another thing. What about all the kids in the
country? Kids that idolize ball players. What are they
going to think about you?

363
00:38:20,925 --> 00:38:23,678
Yeah, hey Colonel!

364
00:38:26,598 --> 00:38:31,644
- Did you hear that?
- I've got to figure some way out of this thing.
Elevators are still running.

365
00:38:33,855 --> 00:38:36,900
- I know one way you can do it.
- How?

366
00:38:37,776 --> 00:38:43,323
Well when you get up there on the radio, all you've
got to do is say the whole thing is a frame-up. It'll
make you a hero, sure as you're born.

367
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:53,416
- Yeah but, how am I going to get my arm fixed?
- That's a cinch. I know someone who'll give you
5000 dollars,

368
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:57,879
- 5000 dollars?
- Yeah, 5000 dollars and he gets it right away

369
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:00,674
You don't have to wait until Christmas.

370
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:06,346
- Look out Long, they're closing in on you.
- Say, who's putting up this dough?

371
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:10,100
The fellow that runs the Chronicel.

372
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:14,813
Here's a speech you can make, and it's all written out
for you.

373
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:21,945
5000 dollars. Holy Mackeral, I can just see the
Heelots coming, the whole lot of them.

374
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:27,617
It's on the level.

375
00:39:38,336 --> 00:39:43,717
- No I'm sorry. Tickets for the broadcast are all gone.
- Phone the Bulletin.

376
00:39:55,854 --> 00:39:59,482
- Hello John, all set for the big night?
- Turn around.

377
00:40:00,442 --> 00:40:03,486
- Big smile Mr. Doe.
- Hold still.

378
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,031
Okay that's enough, take them out.

379
00:40:06,823 --> 00:40:12,037
Here's the speech. It's in caps and double spaced,
you won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous,
are you?

380
00:40:12,662 --> 00:40:14,164
- No!
- Of course not, he wouldn't be.

381
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:16,416
- Who?
- John Doe, the one in there.

382
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:21,713
- Don't let your knees rattle, it picks up on the mike.
- You don't need to be nervous John, all you need to
remember is be sincere.

383
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:24,632
- Take the phone Miss Mitchell. It's for you.
- Yes?

384
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:32,057
- Hello mother.
- Oh thank-you darling. Oh there he is, the poor dear
man.

385
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:44,402
- Have you got the speech I gave you?
- Yeah.

386
00:40:45,445 --> 00:40:51,701
I'll give this money to the Colonel just as soon as you
get started. We'll have a car at the side entrance
waiting for you.

387
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:55,372
- How'd you get in here?
- Oh, I just came in to wish him luck.

388
00:40:55,872 --> 00:41:01,795
Out. My mother wishes you luck too. John, when you
read that speech, please believe every word of it.

389
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,839
- He turned out to be a wonderful person John.
- Who?

390
00:41:05,256 --> 00:41:06,966
John Doe, the one in the speech.

391
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,595
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with
him.

392
00:41:11,805 --> 00:41:14,849
- All right, there he is
- Come on. What's the idea?

393
00:41:17,143 --> 00:41:19,145
Not so much, that's it.

394
00:41:19,604 --> 00:41:23,775
- This is not the time for cheap publicity Mr. Connell.
- Listen, if that guy lays an egg, I want to get
something out of it.

395
00:41:24,734 --> 00:41:29,239
Okay, that's enough. Now everybody get out. Come
on.

396
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:36,621
- How're you doing?
- Okay Benny, bring him in.

397
00:41:39,416 --> 00:41:43,253
- Here you are boss, just like you ordered.
- Symbols of little people. Okay get them up.

398
00:41:44,212 --> 00:41:47,257
This is ridiculous Mr. Connell. Come on, give me a
chance. The man in on the air in a few minutes.

399
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:03,356
- Come on snucks, you'd better bail out.
- Say good-bye Mr. Doe.

400
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:14,784
- Better get ready, one minute to go.
- One minute to go and the score is nothing to nothing.
Please John, you won't let me down, will you?

401
00:42:17,162 --> 00:42:23,793
Will you? Of course you won't. If you think of
yourself as the real John Doe... Listen...

402
00:42:24,753 --> 00:42:31,217
Everything in that speech, are things a certain man
believed in. He was my father John, and when he
talked, people listened...

403
00:42:32,385 --> 00:42:38,308
And they'll listen to you too. Funny you know what
my mother said the other night?

404
00:42:39,267 --> 00:42:42,312
She said to look into your eyes, and I'd see father
there.

405
00:42:45,857 --> 00:42:48,902
- Hey, what do you say?
- Okay, we're coming, come on.

406
00:42:49,736 --> 00:42:52,781
Now listen John, you're a pitcher so get in there and
pitch.

407
00:42:54,866 --> 00:42:56,368
Good luck!

408
00:42:56,826 --> 00:42:58,161
Let him through.

409
00:43:12,384 --> 00:43:15,136
- Hey, let's get out of here.
- There's a door right there. Hey, what are you doing
here?

410
00:43:15,595 --> 00:43:17,430
- That's what I'd like to know.
- Come on out now.

411
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:20,934
- He's a friend of mine. Let him alone, he's all right.

412
00:43:23,019 --> 00:43:25,063
I'll be right over there, pulling for you.

413
00:43:28,149 --> 00:43:30,193
No John, over hrere...

414
00:43:35,073 --> 00:43:36,741
Stand by...

415
00:44:07,647 --> 00:44:10,692
Phone the Chronicel, tell them to start getting those
extras out.

416
00:44:33,131 --> 00:44:36,426
Good evening ladies and gentlemen. This is Kevin
Fry speaking for the New Bulletin.

417
00:44:37,052 --> 00:44:44,934
Tonight we give you something new and entirely
different. Standing beside me is the young man who
has declared publicly on Christmas Eve he intends to
commit suicide.

418
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:50,607
Giving as his reason and I quote: I protest against the
state of civilization, end quote.

419
00:44:51,399 --> 00:44:59,074
Ladies and gentlemen, the New Bulletin takes
pleasure in presenting the man, who is fast becoming
the most talked up person in the whole
country... John Doe.

420
00:45:23,098 --> 00:45:25,100
Ladies and Gentlemen.

421
00:45:27,686 --> 00:45:34,317
I am the man you all know as John Doe. I took that
name, because it seems to describe...

422
00:45:37,779 --> 00:45:41,783
. because it seems to describe the average man.

423
00:45:42,742 --> 00:45:44,786
And that's me.

424
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:54,337
Well it was me, before I said I was going to jump of
the City Hall roof at midnight on Christmas Eve...

425
00:45:55,672 --> 00:46:01,761
Now, I guess I'm not average anymore. Now, I'm
getting all sorts of attention, from big shots too.

426
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,265
- We've been double-crossed.
- . The Mayor and the Governor for instance.

427
00:46:06,474 --> 00:46:11,354
- They don't like those articles
- I've been writing. You're an imposter young fellow
That's a pack of lies you are telling.

428
00:46:13,023 --> 00:46:14,691
Who wrote that speech for you?

429
00:46:28,413 --> 00:46:34,544
- Spencer...
- Ladies and Gentlemen, the disturbance you just
heard, was caused by someone in the audience who
tried to heckle Mr. Doe.

430
00:46:35,337 --> 00:46:36,838
The speech will continue.

431
00:46:43,094 --> 00:46:52,395
People like the Governor and that fellow there, can
stop worrying. I'm not going to talk about them, I'm
going to talk about us.

432
00:46:53,563 --> 00:47:02,864
The average guys. The John Does. If anybody
should ask you what the average John Doe is like,
you couldn't tell him, because he is a million and one
things.

433
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:12,082
He's Mr. Big and Mr. Small. He's simple and he's
wise. He's honest, but he has a streak of arsonary in
his heart.

434
00:47:12,874 --> 00:47:18,088
He seldom walks up to a public telephone, without
shoving his finger into the slot to see if somebody left
a nickle there.

435
00:47:30,225 --> 00:47:36,523
He's the man the ads are written for. He's the fellow
everybody sells things to. He's Joe Doks, the world's
greatest stooge and the world's greatest strength...

436
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:52,872
He's the man the ads are written for. He's the fellow
everybody sells things to. He's Joe Doks, the world's
greatest stooge and the world's greatest strength...

437
00:47:52,872 --> 00:47:59,170
We're a great family, us John Does. We are the meek
who are suppose to inherit the earth.

438
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:08,138
You'll find us everywhere. We raise the crops, we dig
the mines, work the factories, keep the books, fly the
planes, and drive the buses.

439
00:48:08,555 --> 00:48:13,143
When a cop yells stand back there you, he means us,
the John Doe's.

440
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:15,437
What kind of speech is that? Didn't you read it?

441
00:48:16,438 --> 00:48:31,369
We've existed since time began. We built the
pyramids. We saw Christ curcified, pulled the oars for
Roman Empires, sailed the boats for Columbus.

442
00:48:36,082 --> 00:48:46,551
Retreated from Moscow with Napeleon, and froze
with Washington at Valley Forge. We've been in
there, dodging left hooks since before history began
to walk. In our struggle for freedom, we've hit the
canvass many a time, but you always bounce back,
cause we're the people.

443
00:48:52,891 --> 00:48:58,021
There's been a lot of talk about free people going soft,
that we can't take it. That's a lot of hooey!

444
00:48:59,898 --> 00:49:04,819
A free people can beat the world at anything, from war
to tiddlely-winks, if we all pull in the same direction.

445
00:49:13,995 --> 00:49:18,750
I know a lot of you are saying: What can I do? I'm
just a little punk, I don't count.

446
00:49:20,251 --> 00:49:27,676
You're dead wrong. The little punks have always
counted, because in the long run, because the
character of our country is the sum total of the
character of its little punks...

447
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:42,899
But we've all got to get in there and pitch. We can't
win if we don't have the old teamwork and that's
where every John Doe comes in.

448
00:49:44,067 --> 00:49:50,782
It's up to him to get together with his teammate. And
your teammate, my friends, is the guy next door to
you!

449
00:49:52,117 --> 00:49:58,456
Your neighbor, he's a terribly important guy that guy
next door. You're going to need him and he's going to
need you, so look him up.

450
00:49:59,624 --> 00:50:05,588
If he's sick, call on him, if he's hungry, feed him. If
he's out of a job, find him one.

451
00:50:06,589 --> 00:50:10,802
To most of you, your neighbor is a stranger. A guy
with a barking dog and a high fence around him.

452
00:50:11,594 --> 00:50:17,058
Now you can't be a strangerto any guy that is on your
own team.

453
00:50:18,393 --> 00:50:25,817
Tear down the fence that separates you. Tear down
the fence and you tear down a lot of hates and
prejudices. Tear all the fences down in the country
and you'll really have teamwork.

454
00:50:35,201 --> 00:50:41,166
I know a lot of you are saying to yourselves: He's
asking for a miracle to happen. He's expecting
people to change all of a sudden.

455
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:49,049
Well, you're wrong. It's no miracle because I see it
happen once a year.

456
00:50:49,507 --> 00:50:51,551
And so do you, at Christmas time.

457
00:50:52,344 --> 00:50:57,807
There's something swell about the spirit of Christmas,
to see what it does to people. All kinds of people...

458
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:04,064
Now why can't that spirit, that same warm Christmas
spirit, last all year round?

459
00:51:06,649 --> 00:51:13,198
If each and every John Doe would make that spirit
last 365 days of the year,

460
00:51:13,615 --> 00:51:19,996
we'd develop such a strength, we'd create a tidal
wave go good, that no human force could stand
against it

461
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:28,755
Yes my friends. The meek can only inherit the earth,
when the John Doe's start loving their neighbors.

462
00:51:30,632 --> 00:51:35,011
You'd better start right now Don't wait until the game
is called on account of darkness.

463
00:51:37,597 --> 00:51:40,642
Wake up John Doe, you're the hope of the world.

464
00:51:48,858 --> 00:51:51,277
John, you were wonderful.

465
00:51:58,326 --> 00:52:01,371
- Let's get out of here.
- Now, you're talking.

466
00:52:19,806 --> 00:52:24,352
I knew you'd wake up sooner or later. Boy am I glad
we got out of that mess.

467
00:52:25,687 --> 00:52:28,732
462. I had the 5000 bucks sewed up. I could have
been on my way to Doc Brown.

468
00:52:31,776 --> 00:52:35,613
You're a pitcher John. Now go in there and pitch.
What a sucker...

469
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:39,284
She's a Heelot, just like the rest of them. Lucky you
got away from her.

470
00:52:40,368 --> 00:52:44,039
What was I doing up there making a speech anyway?
Me huh? The more I think about it, the more I...

471
00:52:44,664 --> 00:52:49,753
Tear down all the fences? Why if you tore one picket
off, he'd sue you.

472
00:52:50,545 --> 00:52:52,255
5000 bucks, had it right in my hand.

473
00:52:52,714 --> 00:52:56,551
What do you mean he ran away? Well go after him,
find him. That man is terrific.

474
00:53:05,393 --> 00:53:07,437
Here we come!

475
00:53:56,194 --> 00:53:57,362
Jitterbug!

476
00:54:00,448 --> 00:54:02,367
- How much money have we got left?
- A little bit.

477
00:54:02,951 --> 00:54:04,494
- Better make it doughnuts huh?
- Yeah

478
00:54:17,465 --> 00:54:18,633
What'll it be gents?

479
00:54:19,426 --> 00:54:27,183
- Have you got a couple of steaks, about that big and
about that thick?
- And with hash brown potatoes, and tomatoes and...

480
00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:30,979
. and doughnuts, yeah, I know Hey Mark, seekers.

481
00:54:32,105 --> 00:54:35,150
On its way.

482
00:54:40,864 --> 00:54:44,909
Hey, look! Join the John Doe club.

483
00:54:46,786 --> 00:54:48,496
John Doe Club?

484
00:54:57,881 --> 00:54:59,382
- You John Doe?
- Who?

485
00:54:59,632 --> 00:55:02,052
- John Doe!
- Ah, you need glasses buddy

486
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:05,555
- Well, it's the spitting image of John Doe.
- Yeah, well his name is Willaby

487
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:11,353
- John Willaby. I'm a baseball player.
- I'd know that voice anywhere. You can't kid me.

488
00:55:12,354 --> 00:55:17,609
- You're John Doe.
- John Doe?!

489
00:55:18,443 --> 00:55:21,029
- Sitting right there! .
- You mean he's alive?

490
00:55:21,279 --> 00:55:22,655
John Doe. Right there.

491
00:55:35,418 --> 00:55:40,715
Hey operator, tell everybody in town, John Doe was
just in my place.

492
00:55:41,508 --> 00:55:43,551
Yeah, he ordered doughnuts.

493
00:56:01,152 --> 00:56:05,365
- What did John Doe look like, Mr. Mayor?
- He's one of those outdoor-type men.

494
00:56:05,824 --> 00:56:08,868
No, you can't see him, cause you didn't vote for me
last time. Shame on you!

495
00:56:10,453 --> 00:56:11,037
Has Mr. Norten come yet? He should have been here
15 minutes ago. There he comes now.

496
00:56:11,037 --> 00:56:20,296
Has Mr. Norten come yet? He should have been here
15 minutes ago. There he comes now.

497
00:56:20,296 --> 00:56:23,967
Now everybody, on your dignity Don't do anything to
disgrace the little town.

498
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:30,932
- Better let me talk to him.
- But present it to him as a great cause for the
common man.

499
00:56:34,602 --> 00:56:37,647
Here he comes.

500
00:56:38,356 --> 00:56:41,401
How do you do Mr. Norten. I'm the Mayor.

501
00:56:42,819 --> 00:56:46,239
Let me go, you darn fool, I'm the Mayor! Mr. Norten!

502
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:50,535
- I'm the Mayor. Your office told me to hold him.
- That's fine, how is he?

503
00:56:51,244 --> 00:56:56,708
Oh he's fine. He's right in my office there. It's an
honor having John Doe here.

504
00:56:59,085 --> 00:57:02,839
The folks are so excited and proud. Call the paper
and tell them Mr. Norten is here.

505
00:57:04,132 --> 00:57:07,886
Right inside Mr. Norten. My office, very comfortable
Mr. Norten. I just had it air-conditioned.

506
00:57:09,637 --> 00:57:13,266
Gang way. Here he is Mr. Norten, well taken care of...

507
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:17,771
Hello John...

508
00:57:20,565 --> 00:57:22,609
Mr. Mayor, if you don't mind, we'd like to talk to him
alone.

509
00:57:23,068 --> 00:57:26,112
Certainly, certainly, all right everybody, clear out.

510
00:57:36,456 --> 00:57:39,501
Don't argue with me here, wait until we get home.

511
00:57:40,043 --> 00:57:41,586
Don't you push me around like that, even though I am
your wife.

512
00:57:42,003 --> 00:57:45,048
Look Mr. Norten, I think you have a lot of nerve,
having those people hold us here...

513
00:57:47,217 --> 00:57:51,763
- There's nobody holding you here Mr. Doe.
- Well, if there's no one holding us here, let's get
going.

514
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:57,310
- Incidently, my name isn't Doe, it's Willaby.
- Look John, something terribly important has
happened.

515
00:57:57,936 --> 00:58:01,773
- They are forming John Doe clubs.
- We know of eight all ready and they say... John
Doe clubs? Why?

516
00:58:02,232 --> 00:58:04,651
To carry out the principals you talked about in your
radio speech.

517
00:58:04,901 --> 00:58:08,196
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I
don't care for being stopped.

518
00:58:08,655 --> 00:58:13,743
But you don't know how big this thing is. You should
see the thousands of telegrams we've received and
what they're saying about you.

519
00:58:14,536 --> 00:58:19,499
Look it started as a cirruculation stunt, didn't it? Well
you got your cirrculation, so why don't you leave me
alone.

520
00:58:19,916 --> 00:58:27,716
Oh it started as a cirrculation stunt, but it isn't
anymore. Mr. Norten wants to back it, and start John
Doe clubs all over the country He wants to send you
on a lecture tour.

521
00:58:28,842 --> 00:58:34,681
- Me?
- With your ability to influence people, it might grow
into a glorious movement.

522
00:58:35,473 --> 00:58:42,564
Say, let's get something straight here. I don't want
any part of this. If you've got some idea that I'm going
around to lecture people, why you're crazy

523
00:58:43,523 --> 00:58:45,775
Baseball is my racket, and I'm sticking to it.

524
00:58:46,568 --> 00:58:51,322
- Come on Colonel,
- Please, please, I just got rid of one crowd.

525
00:58:51,948 --> 00:58:55,785
Please Mr. Mayor, tell him the John Doe club wants to
talk to him

526
00:58:56,578 --> 00:59:04,002
- Let them in Mr. Mayor, let them come in.
- Okay folks, but remember your manners, no
stampedeing. Walk slow, like you do when you come
to pay your taxes.

527
00:59:11,968 --> 00:59:15,013
- Give me a chance.
- Come right in.

528
00:59:17,307 --> 00:59:22,437
My name is Bert Hansen Mr. Doe. I'm the head soda-
jerkeratthe drug store.

529
00:59:23,396 --> 00:59:29,235
Well sir, me and the wife heard your broadcast and
we got quite a bang out of it, especially my wife.

530
00:59:30,195 --> 00:59:35,825
Kept me up half the night saying: That man's right
honey. The trouble with the world is nobody gives a
hoot about his neighbor.

531
00:59:36,284 --> 00:59:44,250
And that's why everybody is sore and cranky to each
other in town. I kept saying that's fine, but how does
a guy go around loving the kind of neighbors we've
got?

532
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:47,295
Old Sourpuss for instance...

533
00:59:47,879 --> 00:59:55,512
See Sourpuss Smithers is a guy lives all alone next
door to us. He's a cranky old man, runs a second-
hand furniture store. We haven't spoken to him for
years.

534
00:59:57,389 --> 01:00:06,398
I always figured he was an ornery old gent, who hated
the world cause he was always slamming his garage
door and playing the radio so loud, he kept half the
neighbors up.

535
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:16,241
Well next morning, I'm out watering the lawn, and
there is old Sourpuss on the other side of the hedge,
straightening out a dent in his fender

536
01:00:17,409 --> 01:00:22,163
My wife yells to me out the window. Go on, speak to
him Bert.

537
01:00:22,747 --> 01:00:31,089
I yelled over to him Good-morning Mr. Smithers. He
went right on pounding his fender...

538
01:00:32,048 --> 01:00:36,970
Was I burnt. So I turned around to give my wife a
dirty look and she said louder, louder, he didn't hear
you.

539
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:43,435
So in a voice that you could have heard in the next
county, I yelled, Good morning Mr. Smithers...

540
01:00:44,769 --> 01:00:57,532
Well sir, you could have knocked me over with a
feather. Old Sourpuss turns around, surprised like and
puts on a big smile, came over and took my hand like
an old lodge brother and he said, good-morning
Hansen.

541
01:00:58,533 --> 01:01:06,499
I've been wanting to talk to you for years, but I
thought you didn't like me, and then he started
chatting away

542
01:01:07,292 --> 01:01:14,341
...like a happy little kid. Well, before we were through,
I found out Mr. Smithers is a swell egg, only he's
pretty deaf.

543
01:01:14,966 --> 01:01:19,179
And he says it's a shame, what little we know about
our neighbors, and then he got an idea and says...

544
01:01:19,804 --> 01:01:24,893
...how about inviting everybody some place where we
can all get together and get to know each other a little
better?

545
01:01:26,061 --> 01:01:32,233
I'm feeling so good by this time, I'm right for anything,
so, Smithers goes around the neighborhood, inviting
everybody to a meeting at the schoolhouse.

546
01:01:33,026 --> 01:01:37,072
And I tell everybody that comes in the store, including
my boss...

547
01:01:37,864 --> 01:01:40,116
Oh, I'm talking too much.

548
01:01:41,076 --> 01:01:42,410
No, no, tell more.

549
01:01:43,244 --> 01:01:52,796
Over 40 people showed up. None of us knew what to
do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad
everybody was and to say hello to one another.

550
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:59,761
- Oh yeah, we made Mr. Smithers Chairman.
- And we decided to call ourselves the John Doe club.

551
01:02:00,553 --> 01:02:03,014
Oh incidently, this is my wife. Come here honey.

552
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:06,559
- This is my wife Mr. Doe.
- How do you do Mr. Doe?

553
01:02:12,565 --> 01:02:18,363
- This is Sourpuss, or excuse me, Mr. Smithers, Mr.
Doe.
- That's all right, if you didn't call me Sourpuss, it
wouldn't feel natural.

554
01:02:21,491 --> 01:02:25,161
I guess everybody in the neighborhood came except
for the Laneys.

555
01:02:25,954 --> 01:02:30,709
The Laneys live in a big house, with an iron fence
around it and they always keep their blinds drawn.

556
01:02:31,668 --> 01:02:39,300
We always figured he was just an old miser, always
keeping his blinds drawn, so why bother inviting him?

557
01:02:39,926 --> 01:02:47,892
Until the milkman spoke up and said, say you've got
the Laney's all wrong. And then he tells us how they
cancelled their milk last week.

558
01:02:48,685 --> 01:02:55,025
And when he found a note in the bottle, he got kind of
curious and peeked in under the blind and found the
house was empty...

559
01:02:56,026 --> 01:02:57,902
If you ask me, he says, they're starving.

560
01:02:58,695 --> 01:03:04,159
Old man Laney has been bringing his furniture over to
my place at night. One piece at a time and selling it.

561
01:03:05,827 --> 01:03:09,330
Half a dozen of us ran over there to fetch him and we
brought him to the meeting.

562
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:18,089
What a reception they got. Everybody shook hands
with them and made a fuss over them and well finally
Mr. And Mrs. Laney just sat down and cried...

563
01:03:19,090 --> 01:03:22,927
- And then we started finding out about a lot of other
people.
- You know Grouble for instance.

564
01:03:23,553 --> 01:03:26,598
- Grouble is here.
- Yeah, for sure.

565
01:03:27,932 --> 01:03:30,977
Of course you don't know Grouble, but...

566
01:03:31,686 --> 01:03:36,733
He's a man that everybody figured was the worse no-
account in the neighborhood. He was living like a
hermit.

567
01:03:37,609 --> 01:03:42,155
Nobody would have anything to do with him. That is
until the postman told us the truth.

568
01:03:43,323 --> 01:03:49,621
Grouble he says, lives out of garbage cans, because
he won't take charity.

569
01:03:50,205 --> 01:03:57,087
- Just like you said on the radio Mr. Doe.
- About a dozen families got together and gave
Grouble a job, watering their lawns. Isn't that
wonderful.

570
01:03:57,879 --> 01:04:01,716
And then we found jobs for 6 other people and they've
all gone off relief.

571
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:07,263
- And my boss found a job for old-man Laney
- And he gave you that 5 dollar raise.

572
01:04:07,889 --> 01:04:09,599
Yeah, ain't that swell.

573
01:04:12,018 --> 01:04:20,485
- Well Bert, I feel slighted. I would like to join, but
nobody asked me.
- I'm sorry Mr. Mayor, but we voted no politician could
join.

574
01:04:21,486 --> 01:04:25,699
Just the John Doe's of the neighborhood, cause you
know how politicians are.

575
01:04:30,954 --> 01:04:40,880
The reason we wanted to tell you this Mr. Doe was to
give you an idea of what you started. And from where
I'm standing, I don't see any sense in seeing you
jumping off any building.

576
01:04:42,215 --> 01:04:43,383
No...

577
01:04:44,175 --> 01:04:50,181
Well, thank-you for listening. Good-bye Mr Doe.
You're a wonderful man.

578
01:04:51,349 --> 01:04:54,394
It strikes me that you can be mighty useful, walking
around for a while.

579
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:58,314
Good-bye.

580
01:05:05,113 --> 01:05:09,659
I'm Mrs. Laney, Mr. Doe. May god bless you my boy.

581
01:05:43,735 --> 01:05:45,612
I'm all mixed up.

582
01:05:49,449 --> 01:05:51,159
I dont' get it...

583
01:05:52,494 --> 01:05:57,040
All those swell people think I'm going to jump of a
building or something. I've never had any such idea.

584
01:06:02,128 --> 01:06:05,173
A man would have to be a mighty fine example
himself, if he were going around telling other people...

585
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,844
Say, what happened here the other night, was on
account of Miss Mitchell. She wrote the stuf.

586
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:14,224
Don't you see what a wonderful thing this could be?
But we need you John.

587
01:06:14,849 --> 01:06:17,894
You're hooked. I can see that right now Well, I'm
through.

588
01:06:21,439 --> 01:06:29,072
For three years, I've been trying to get you up to the
Columbia River Country, first it was your glass arm,
then it was something else, now it's the John Doe
club. Well, I ain't waiting another minute.

589
01:06:32,909 --> 01:06:34,619
Gang way you Heelots!

590
01:06:36,663 --> 01:06:39,708
Colonel wait a minute. Colonel!!

591
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:44,087
Now I want you to go along with John Doe and Miss
Mitchell to handle the press and the radio.

592
01:06:44,713 --> 01:06:46,214
- Me?
- Yes, I don't want to take any chances.

593
01:06:46,506 --> 01:06:47,674
- And Johnson.
- Yes D.B.

594
01:06:47,924 --> 01:06:53,221
Your crew will do the mop-up job. They'll follow John
Doe into every town and see that the clubs are
properly organized and the charters issued.

595
01:06:54,347 --> 01:06:57,475
There are only 8 flags up there now, and I want to see
that map covered before we are through.

596
01:08:04,793 --> 01:08:10,090
This has been growing like wildfire. If they had been
making demands, I would understand it, but the John
Does ask for nothing.

597
01:08:12,008 --> 01:08:15,053
People are going off relief. If this keeps up, I'll be out
of a job.

598
01:08:16,513 --> 01:08:20,934
As soon as he gets strong enough, we'll find out what
John Doe wants. 30 every Thursday, 60 at 60! Who
knows what!

599
01:08:22,352 --> 01:08:25,397
I'm sorry boss, they just won't let anyone talk politics
to them. It's crazy!

600
01:08:26,314 --> 01:08:29,359
We've got to get to him. He represents millions of
voters.

601
01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:44,791
I tell you ladies and gentlemen, this has been nothing
short of a prairie fire. We've received so many
charters to the John Doe club, that we haven't been
able to take care of them.

602
01:08:45,417 --> 01:08:47,627
I don't need to have that many pins stuck in me.

603
01:08:47,919 --> 01:08:50,964
This John Doe convention is a natural. It's going to
put our city on the map...

604
01:08:51,673 --> 01:08:55,135
Why over 2400 John Doe clubls are sending
delegates. Can you imagine that?

605
01:08:56,136 --> 01:09:01,057
You, Mr. Mayor, will be the official host. You will make
the arrangements for decorating the city the parade,
and the reception for John Doe when he gets home...

606
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:04,102
- And don't wear your high hat...
- No high hat?

607
01:09:04,728 --> 01:09:09,107
No. And from you Connell, I want a special John Doe
edition everyday until the convention is over.

608
01:09:09,733 --> 01:09:15,363
And now if you will please, step into the outer ofice
and look your prettiest, because there are
photographers there to take pictures of this
committee.

609
01:09:15,989 --> 01:09:18,241
Don't worry D.B. Everything will be taken care of.

610
01:09:26,332 --> 01:09:28,043
- Well I don't get it.
- Get what?

611
01:09:28,835 --> 01:09:35,050
This John Doe has cost you a fortune. Now this
convention is going to cost plenty

612
01:09:35,842 --> 01:09:40,221
- Well?
- Well, I'm stuck with 2 and 2 and I'm a sucker if I can
make 4 out of it.

613
01:09:41,181 --> 01:09:42,891
Where do you come in?

614
01:09:45,852 --> 01:09:50,398
I have the satisfaction of knowing, that my money has
been spent for a worthy cause.

615
01:09:51,399 --> 01:09:53,610
I say, I'd better stick to running the paper huh?

616
01:09:54,444 --> 01:09:55,945
I think maybe you'd better.

617
01:09:59,949 --> 01:10:07,040
And Connell. I'd have the John Doe contract, and all
the receipts and the money we advanced him and the
letter from Miss Mitchell that I gave 1000 dollars for.

618
01:10:08,541 --> 01:10:10,960
Yes... sure.

619
01:10:12,170 --> 01:10:17,801
- Well, we leave for the airport in half an hour
- Is that Johnny boy's room, I'd better hustle him up.
He'll be ready on time, he's packing.

620
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:21,179
- Did you see his picture on the cover ofTime?
- Yeah.

621
01:10:21,596 --> 01:10:29,729
I've got to give you credit Annie Girl, I've handled
some big promotions in my time, everything from a
World's Fair to a channel swimmer, but this one
certainly got me spinning.

622
01:10:31,272 --> 01:10:33,483
And now a John Doe convention.

623
01:10:35,568 --> 01:10:41,908
If you could only get him to jump ofthe City Hall roof
on Christmas Eve, I'd guarantee you half a million
people there.

624
01:10:42,325 --> 01:10:46,204
- Charlie... what do you make of him?
- Who, Johnny Boy?

625
01:10:47,539 --> 01:10:51,042
I don't know what angle you want, but I'll give you a
quick...

626
01:10:51,835 --> 01:10:59,592
Number one, he's got great yokel appeal, but he's a
nice guy. Number two, he really beginning to believe
that he wrote that suicide letter that you made up...

627
01:11:00,218 --> 01:11:03,722
- Number three, he thinks that you're Joan ofArc or
something.
- Yeah, I know.

628
01:11:04,347 --> 01:11:10,520
Number four, well you know what number four is.
He's nuts about you. Yeah, it's running out of his
ears.

629
01:11:11,771 --> 01:11:14,816
You left out number five. We're all heels, me
especially.

630
01:11:17,402 --> 01:11:19,112
Come in.

631
01:11:24,909 --> 01:11:26,953
- I'm all packed.
- Good! I'll go and get Benny boy

632
01:11:28,288 --> 01:11:29,998
Okay Charlie boy.

633
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:46,973
- Can I help you pack?
- No thank-you.

634
01:11:56,024 --> 01:11:59,402
- Do you care if I sit down, out here.
- No.

635
01:12:09,788 --> 01:12:12,832
I had a crazy dream last night...

636
01:12:15,502 --> 01:12:19,005
- It was about you.
- About me?

637
01:12:19,798 --> 01:12:22,842
It sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your father.

638
01:12:29,474 --> 01:12:31,893
There was something I was trying to stop you from
doing.

639
01:12:33,019 --> 01:12:39,567
So I got up out of bed, and I walked right through the
wall here, straight to your bed.

640
01:12:41,069 --> 01:12:44,114
You know how dreams are... and there you were in
bed.

641
01:12:45,365 --> 01:12:49,411
But you were a little girl, you know, about 10 and very
pretty too.

642
01:12:51,287 --> 01:13:02,799
So I shook you and as soon as you opened your
eyes, you hopped out of bed and started running like
the devil in your nightgown, and you ran right out the
window there and you ran over roofs of buildings for
miles...

643
01:13:03,591 --> 01:13:05,301
And i was chasing you.

644
01:13:06,636 --> 01:13:13,018
And all the time you were running, you kept growing
bigger and bigger and pretty soon you were as big as
you are now.

645
01:13:13,601 --> 01:13:14,978
You know, grown up.

646
01:13:16,104 --> 01:13:20,316
And all the time I kept asking myself, what am I
chasing her for?

647
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:25,530
And I didn't know. Isn't that an odd one?

648
01:13:27,741 --> 01:13:35,331
Well, anyway you ran into some place and I ran in
after you. When I got there, there you were, getting
married.

649
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:42,881
The nightgown had changed into a beautiful wedding
gown.

650
01:13:45,258 --> 01:13:46,968
You sure looked pretty too.

651
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:51,514
And then I knew what it was I was trying to stop you
from doing.

652
01:13:52,432 --> 01:13:54,142
Dreams are sure crazy, aren't they?

653
01:13:57,771 --> 01:13:59,481
Would you like to know who it was, you were
marrying?

654
01:14:00,815 --> 01:14:03,860
A tall, handsome man I suppose...

655
01:14:05,653 --> 01:14:10,575
It was that fellow that sends you flowers everyday
What's his name? Mr. Norten's nephew.

656
01:14:12,619 --> 01:14:14,579
- Sheldon...
- Yes, him.

657
01:14:16,373 --> 01:14:17,916
But here's the funniest part of it all...

658
01:14:19,084 --> 01:14:22,128
I was the fellow up there doing the marrying. You
know, the Justice of the Peace or something.

659
01:14:23,004 --> 01:14:27,759
- Were you? I thought that you were chasing me?
- Yes, I was, but I was your father then, you see.

660
01:14:28,885 --> 01:14:35,058
But the real me John Doe, well that is, Long John
Willaby, I was the fellow up there with the book.

661
01:14:36,601 --> 01:14:39,646
- Do you know what I mean?
- Guess so, then what happened?

662
01:14:41,773 --> 01:14:49,739
Well, I took you across my knee, and I started
spanking you. That is I didn't do it, I mean I did do it
but, it wasn't me see, I was your father then.

663
01:14:51,074 --> 01:15:02,419
I put you across my knee and said, Annie, I won't
allow you to marry a man that is just rich or has a
secretary that sends you flowers...

664
01:15:03,586 --> 01:15:12,971
The man that you marry has got to swim rivers for
you, he's got to climb high mountains for you, he's got
to...

665
01:15:14,139 --> 01:15:20,311
And all the time, the guy up there with the book, just
stood there nodding his head and he said...

666
01:15:21,271 --> 01:15:24,774
Good Pop. Whack her one from me, cause that's just
the way I feel about it too.

667
01:15:26,109 --> 01:15:32,115
He said, come on down here and whack her yourself.
So I came down and I whacked you a good one.

668
01:15:33,283 --> 01:15:36,327
So he whacked you and then I whacked you another
one then we were both whacking you...

669
01:15:38,830 --> 01:15:42,292
Well if you're through whacking her, come on, let's get
going. Okay fellows, right in here...

670
01:15:55,805 --> 01:15:58,850
- Hej Benny.
- When's our plane take off again?

671
01:15:59,392 --> 01:16:00,185
A couple of minutes.

672
01:16:01,353 --> 01:16:05,023
How many people do you think we've talked to
already? Outside the radio I mean.

673
01:16:05,648 --> 01:16:10,028
- I don't know. About 300,000.
- 300.000.

674
01:16:11,696 --> 01:16:18,787
What makes them come Anne. What makes them
listen and then set up their John Doe clubs.

675
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:21,998
I've been trying to figure it out...

676
01:16:22,624 --> 01:16:29,673
What we're handing them is a platter It's been heard
a milllion times. Love thy neighbor, clouds of silver
linings, turn the other cheek...

677
01:16:30,298 --> 01:16:34,344
I've heard it a million times too, but... There you are.

678
01:16:36,554 --> 01:16:39,891
Maybe they're like me. Just beginning to get an idea
of what those things mean.

679
01:16:41,559 --> 01:16:45,438
I never really thoughtabout people before. They were
justsomebody to fill up the bleachers.

680
01:16:46,773 --> 01:16:50,985
The only time I worried about them, was when they
didn't come in to see me pitch.

681
01:16:54,447 --> 01:17:00,078
Lately, I've been watching them when I talk to them. I
can see something in their faces.

682
01:17:02,122 --> 01:17:06,001
I can feel that they are hungry for something.

683
01:17:08,420 --> 01:17:16,011
Do you know what I mean. Maybe that's why they
came. Maybe they're just lonely and wanted
somebody to say hello to them...

684
01:17:18,221 --> 01:17:23,685
I know how they feel. I've been lonely and hungry for
something practically all my life.

685
01:17:30,567 --> 01:17:32,277
All aboard folks.

686
01:17:35,947 --> 01:17:38,992
- Somebody else sitting here?
- No, no, no, that's your seat.

687
01:17:39,492 --> 01:17:42,120
- And this is your coat.
- Mine?

688
01:17:42,746 --> 01:17:44,456
A little token of appreciation.

689
01:17:48,626 --> 01:17:52,839
It's beautiful D.B. I don't know what to say

690
01:17:53,465 --> 01:17:55,175
Well don't say anything. Just sit down.

691
01:17:59,888 --> 01:18:02,140
Go ahead, open it, open it.

692
01:18:10,106 --> 01:18:13,151
- Oh, it's lovely.
- And a new contract goes with it.

693
01:18:19,199 --> 01:18:23,244
Well, come on, spring it. You've got something on
your mind. Must be stupendous...

694
01:18:25,121 --> 01:18:28,958
That's what I like about her. Right to the point, like
that!

695
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:35,382
All right PracticalAnnie, here it is. Tomorrow night,
before a crowd of 15,000 people, I'm talking a nation
wide radio hook-up, John Doe will annouce the
formation of a third party.

696
01:18:35,382 --> 01:18:42,972
All right PracticalAnnie, here it is. Tomorrow night,
before a crowd of 15,000 people, I'm talking a nation
wide radio hook-up, John Doe will annouce the
formation of a third party.

697
01:18:42,972 --> 01:18:46,017
- A third party?
- Yes, the John Doe party.

698
01:18:47,102 --> 01:18:52,941
Devoted to the interests of all the John Doe's all over
the country.

699
01:18:54,776 --> 01:19:01,324
Which practically means 90% of the voters. He will
also announce the candicy of the third party for
President.

700
01:19:02,826 --> 01:19:08,665
A man whom he personally recommends. A great
humanitarium. The best friend the John Doe's have.

701
01:19:11,084 --> 01:19:14,129
- Mr. D.B. Norten...
- Yes.

702
01:19:47,203 --> 01:19:56,212
Though the opening of the convention is hours away
the delegates are pouring into the ball park by the
droves.

703
01:20:00,216 --> 01:20:07,474
These John Does are the people that have been
laughed at and ridiculed, but here they are...

704
01:20:08,099 --> 01:20:15,190
gay and happy, having travelled thousands of
miles... Their expenses paid by their neighbors, who
have come here to pay homage to their hero, John
Doe.

705
01:20:18,109 --> 01:20:21,780
It's a simple idea that can sweep the country...

706
01:20:22,405 --> 01:20:27,869
An idea based on friendliness, on giving and not
taking. On helping your neighbor and expecting
nothing in return.

707
01:20:28,828 --> 01:20:34,834
And if a thing like this can happen, don't let any of
your grumbling friends tell you that humanity is falling
apart.

708
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:42,008
This is John B. Hues signing of now and returning
you to our main studio, until 9 o'clock, when the
convention will officially open.

709
01:20:44,594 --> 01:20:46,471
John! Come in.

710
01:20:47,806 --> 01:20:52,894
- Say I'm kind of... it's raining out a little.
- That's all right. It's good to see you.

711
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:55,772
- Sit down.
Thanks.

712
01:21:11,204 --> 01:21:15,417
- It's forAnne.
- Oh how nice! Thank-you very much.

713
01:21:17,502 --> 01:21:20,547
- I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
- She isn't?

714
01:21:21,047 --> 01:21:24,551
No she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her
She went over to Mr. Norten's house.

715
01:21:28,763 --> 01:21:30,640
Did you want to see her about something important?

716
01:21:31,599 --> 01:21:33,685
Yeah, well no, it will wait.

717
01:21:35,186 --> 01:21:40,483
He's a nice man, Mr. Norten I mean. He's done an
awful lot for...

718
01:21:48,241 --> 01:21:52,454
My coat is pretty wet. I'm afraid I may have wet the
couch a little.

719
01:21:59,336 --> 01:22:03,173
- Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.
- Yes of course, I'll see that she gets the flowers.

720
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:08,094
- Good night Mrs. Mitchell.
- Good-night John.

721
01:22:14,351 --> 01:22:16,061
Mrs. Mitchell.

722
01:22:17,187 --> 01:22:20,231
I'm kind of glad thatAnne isn't here.

723
01:22:22,734 --> 01:22:27,489
I came over here hoping to see her alone. Kind of
hoping I wouldn't too, you know

724
01:22:29,908 --> 01:22:32,327
There was something I wanted to talk to her about.

725
01:22:35,997 --> 01:22:37,499
It can wait, I guess.

726
01:22:38,124 --> 01:22:41,169
- Good-night...
- Goodnight John.

727
01:22:44,381 --> 01:22:46,800
Say Mrs. Mitchell, have you ever been married?

728
01:22:48,301 --> 01:22:51,346
I'm sure you have. That's pretty silly...

729
01:22:53,139 --> 01:22:55,392
I guess you must think I'm kind of batty...

730
01:22:57,268 --> 01:22:59,521
I guess I'd better be going.

731
01:23:01,356 --> 01:23:02,732
John...

732
01:23:04,067 --> 01:23:07,112
John, my husband said, I love you, will you marry
me?

733
01:23:07,987 --> 01:23:09,322
He did?

734
01:23:10,323 --> 01:23:12,534
- What happened?
- I married him.

735
01:23:14,244 --> 01:23:17,288
That's what I mean, see? It was as easy as all that?

736
01:23:19,791 --> 01:23:26,131
You see, I love Anne, and it's going to be awfully hard
for me to say it...

737
01:23:27,298 --> 01:23:34,014
She's so wonderful and all I ever was, was a bush-
league pitcher.

738
01:23:36,433 --> 01:23:41,688
I think she is in love with another man. The one she
made up. You know, the real John Doe.

739
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:53,700
That's pretty tough competition. He would know what
to say. I get up to it, around it and back of it, but I
never know what to say.

740
01:23:54,284 --> 01:24:04,210
You know what I mean. So, the only chance I've got,
is if somebody could kind of give her a warning. Sort
of prepare her for the shock.

741
01:24:05,754 --> 01:24:12,093
- You mean you would like me to do it?
- Yeah, I was thinking, sort of break the ice.

742
01:24:14,512 --> 01:24:16,389
Of course I will John...

743
01:24:19,351 --> 01:24:23,021
Thank-you Mrs. Mitchell. You're Okay.

744
01:24:35,617 --> 01:24:42,123
This John Doe meeting is going to be one of the
biggest things that ever happened! They're coming
from all over, trains, boxcars, wagons...

745
01:24:43,124 --> 01:24:46,169
- Have you had your dinner yet?
- Not yet.

746
01:24:46,878 --> 01:24:48,922
- Go ahead and have your dinner.
- Wait a minute John.

747
01:24:53,843 --> 01:24:58,056
- How are you Mr. Connell.
- Hello John. John I want to have a little talk with you.

748
01:25:01,017 --> 01:25:03,603
What's the matter? Are you fallilng, come here.

749
01:25:05,814 --> 01:25:09,317
Did you read that speech that you are going to read
tonight?

750
01:25:09,943 --> 01:25:12,987
No I never read the speeches before I make them. I
get more of a kick out of it that way.

751
01:25:13,863 --> 01:25:19,327
Just exactly what I thought. Benny go down to the
office and tell them to give you the speech. There's a
copy on my desk.

752
01:25:19,786 --> 01:25:25,417
- You know Mr. Norten told me not to leave him, not
even for a minute.
- Go and get it, we'll be at Jim's bar up the street.

753
01:25:28,003 --> 01:25:30,755
You're a nice guy John. I like you.

754
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:38,304
You're gentle. I've always liked gentle people. Me,
I'm hard.

755
01:25:44,436 --> 01:25:50,442
Yep, I'm hard, but you want to know something? I've
got a weakness. Never guess that, would you?

756
01:25:51,234 --> 01:25:54,279
Well, I have. Want to know what it is?

757
01:25:55,530 --> 01:25:59,576
Star Spangled Banner. Screwy huh?

758
01:26:00,535 --> 01:26:05,081
Maybe it is, but play the Star Spangled Banner and
I'm a sucker for it.

759
01:26:06,166 --> 01:26:09,210
Always gets me right here. You know what I mean?

760
01:26:10,086 --> 01:26:12,839
- Yeah, gets me right back here.
- Oh, back there huh?

761
01:26:12,839 --> 01:26:15,508
- Yeah, gets me right back here.
- Oh, back there huh?

762
01:26:15,508 --> 01:26:18,553
Well, every man to his own taste.

763
01:26:21,765 --> 01:26:25,852
You weren't old enough for the World War, were you
John?

764
01:26:26,603 --> 01:26:30,148
No of course not. You must have been just a kid.

765
01:26:33,735 --> 01:26:37,614
I was. I was young and raring to go.

766
01:26:39,908 --> 01:26:43,453
Know what my old man did when I joined up? He
joined up too.

767
01:26:44,412 --> 01:26:48,958
Got to be a Sgt. And here's the kick for you. We were
in the same outfit.

768
01:26:50,543 --> 01:26:52,671
Funny huh?

769
01:26:57,384 --> 01:27:02,555
He was killed John. I saw him die.

770
01:27:05,058 --> 01:27:08,103
I was right there and I saw it with my own eyes.

771
01:27:12,982 --> 01:27:15,527
Me, I came out without a scratch.

772
01:27:17,612 --> 01:27:20,281
Except for my ulcers...

773
01:27:25,078 --> 01:27:28,123
I should be drinking milk you know This stuff is
poison.

774
01:27:29,374 --> 01:27:32,419
Tommy?
What do you say huh?

775
01:27:36,297 --> 01:27:42,262
Yep, I'm a sucker for this country I'm a sucker for the
Star Spangled Banner and I'm a sucker for this
country.

776
01:27:43,013 --> 01:27:46,766
I like what we got here. I like it.

777
01:27:48,268 --> 01:27:53,690
A guy can say what he wants and do what he wants,
without having a baonet shoved in his belly

778
01:27:54,441 --> 01:27:57,485
- And that's all right, isn't it?
- You bet ya!

779
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:02,949
- And we don't want anybody coming around and
changing that do we?
- No sir!

780
01:28:05,201 --> 01:28:09,539
When they do, I get mad. I get boiling mad.

781
01:28:11,041 --> 01:28:14,085
Right now John, I'm sizzling.

782
01:28:15,128 --> 01:28:18,173
I get mad for a lot of other guys, besides myself...

783
01:28:19,841 --> 01:28:26,806
I get mad for a guy named Washington, and a guy
named Jeffereson and Lincoln.

784
01:28:27,974 --> 01:28:33,605
Lighthouses John. Lighthouses in a foggy world.

785
01:28:36,316 --> 01:28:39,361
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, you bet.

786
01:28:43,031 --> 01:28:47,452
- Listen pal. That fifth column stuf was pretty rotten,
isn't it?
- Yeah, it certainly is.

787
01:28:48,328 --> 01:28:53,083
And you'd feel an awful sucker if you found yourself
marching right in the middle of it, wouldn't you?

788
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:59,756
You wouldn't know, cause you're gentle, but that's
what you're doing.

789
01:29:01,299 --> 01:29:04,344
You're mixed up with skunk!

790
01:29:05,261 --> 01:29:08,306
A no-good dangerous skunk!

791
01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:16,356
- Say, you're not talking about Mr. Norten, are you?
- I'm not talking about his grandfather's pet poodle.

792
01:29:20,527 --> 01:29:24,739
- You must be wrong Mr. Connell. He's been
marvelous about the John Doe clubs.

793
01:29:28,201 --> 01:29:31,246
- You're really sold on this John Doe idea, aren't you?
- Sure.

794
01:29:32,163 --> 01:29:35,208
Yes sir, I don't blame you, so am I. It's a beautiful
miracle.

795
01:29:35,917 --> 01:29:40,338
A miracle that could only happen right here, in the
good old U.S.A.

796
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:47,804
I think it's terrific. What do you think about that? Me,
hard-boiled Connell and I think it's terrific.

797
01:29:50,765 --> 01:29:59,816
Now suppose an unmentionable worm, whose initials
are D.B., was trying to use that to shove his way into
the White House?

798
01:30:00,775 --> 01:30:07,615
So he could put the screws on. So he could turn out
those lights in the lighthouses.

799
01:30:10,660 --> 01:30:18,710
- What would you say about that huh?
- They can't use the John Doe clubs for politics.

800
01:30:19,544 --> 01:30:25,091
- That's the whole idea.
- Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like
Haman doing here in town?

801
01:30:25,842 --> 01:30:30,680
And a labour leader like Bennet, and a lot of other big
shots up at D.B.'s house right now

802
01:30:31,306 --> 01:30:36,394
Wolves! Wolves John, waiting to cut up the John
Does...

803
01:30:37,937 --> 01:30:44,986
- Wait til you get a gander at that speech you are
going to make tonight
- Miss Mitchell writes those speeches, and nobody
can make her write that kind of stuf.

804
01:30:45,612 --> 01:30:48,656
They can't huh? Who do you think writes them? My
Aunt Emma?

805
01:30:49,366 --> 01:30:53,870
I know she writes them and gets a big bonus for
writing them too.
799. A mink coat and a diamond bracelet. Don't write
them!

806
01:30:54,537 --> 01:30:58,166
A mink coat and a diamond bracelet. Don't write
them!

807
01:30:58,792 --> 01:31:03,463
Why that gold-grabbing dame would double-cross her
own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!

808
01:31:06,299 --> 01:31:09,344
- Lf you weren't drunk, I would...
- Hey boss!

809
01:31:10,679 --> 01:31:16,518
- Here's the speech boss.
- Go on and read it John and then start socking.

810
01:31:18,937 --> 01:31:21,356
Hey wait a minute Mr. Doe.

811
01:31:22,774 --> 01:31:25,819
Tommy, you'd better bring me a glass of milk.

812
01:31:28,947 --> 01:31:31,366
I'm smoking too much.

813
01:31:34,536 --> 01:31:38,957
Yes Charlie. Got everything all set? Got John Doe
taken care of?

814
01:31:41,376 --> 01:31:44,921
How many people do you think will be there? 15,000!
Oh, that's fine.

815
01:31:46,631 --> 01:31:51,052
Listen Charlie, as soon as John Doe stops talking
about me, I want you to start that demonstration.

816
01:31:52,470 --> 01:31:55,181
Don't worry about that D.B. My boys are there.
They'll take care of it.

817
01:31:55,181 --> 01:31:57,058
Don't worry about that D.B. My boys are there.
They'll take care of it.

818
01:31:57,058 --> 01:32:00,103
Yes, I'll be there 15 minutes after I get your call.

819
01:32:01,146 --> 01:32:03,481
- Why Mr. Doe.
- Where are they?

820
01:32:04,107 --> 01:32:06,026
They're in the dining room sir.

821
01:32:10,488 --> 01:32:13,533
Well gentlemen, I think we are ready to throw that
great, big bombshell.

822
01:32:15,452 --> 01:32:20,957
A conservative estimate says that we will get
anywhere between 15 and 20 million John Doe votes

823
01:32:21,708 --> 01:32:26,671
Add to that, the labor board Mr. Bennet will throw in...

824
01:32:27,547 --> 01:32:29,632
...nothing can stop us.

825
01:32:30,300 --> 01:32:33,345
As I said before, I am with you, providing that you can
guarantee the John Doe vote.

826
01:32:34,012 --> 01:32:38,975
You can count on me, on one condition. Bennet has
to be taken care of.

827
01:32:39,642 --> 01:32:43,605
Didn't I tell you everybody in this room will be taken
care of. My agreement with you gentlemen stands!

828
01:32:44,481 --> 01:32:48,318
I'm with you D.B., but I still think it's a very daring
thing we're attempting.

829
01:32:48,985 --> 01:32:54,366
These are daring times. We are coming to a new
order of things. There's too much talk going on in this
country.

830
01:32:55,367 --> 01:32:58,411
Too many concessions have been made. What the
people need is an iron-hand.

831
01:33:00,830 --> 01:33:02,415
Discipline!

832
01:33:05,043 --> 01:33:12,092
May I offer a little toast to Miss Anne Mitchell. The
beautiful and brilliant lady who is responsible for all
this.

833
01:33:14,135 --> 01:33:16,930
Mr. Norten I would like to talk to you alone for a
minute.

834
01:33:17,764 --> 01:33:20,809
- Miss Mitchell has something to say to us.
- Say it!

835
01:33:26,022 --> 01:33:27,691
Hello...

836
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:38,034
John I'm so glad to see you. I was terribly worried.

837
01:33:38,535 --> 01:33:43,206
- Did you write this?
- Yes I did John, but I had no idea what was going on.

838
01:33:44,165 --> 01:33:45,959
- You didn't?
- No.

839
01:33:47,794 --> 01:33:50,255
That's a swell bracelet you're wearing.

840
01:33:53,967 --> 01:33:57,012
John, why aren't you at the convention?

841
01:34:12,527 --> 01:34:16,614
- Is there anything wrong?
- No, no nothing is wrong. Everything is fine.

842
01:34:18,366 --> 01:34:23,455
So there's going to be a new order of things huh?
Everybody's going to cut himself a nice fat slice of the
John Does huh?

843
01:34:25,623 --> 01:34:30,128
You forgot one detail, Mr. Bigshot. You forgot me.
The prize stooge of the world.

844
01:34:31,087 --> 01:34:37,177
Why you or anybody else thinks he's going to use the
John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's going
to have to do it over my dead body.

845
01:34:37,802 --> 01:34:43,558
Now hold on a minute young man. That's rather big
talk. I started the John Doe clubs with my money

846
01:34:44,309 --> 01:34:48,396
- And I'll decide whether or not they are being properly
used.
- No you won't. You're through deciding anything.

847
01:34:49,356 --> 01:34:56,738
And what's more, I'm going down to that convention
and I'm going to tell those people exactly what you
and all your fine-feathered friends here are trying to
cook up for them.

848
01:34:58,490 --> 01:35:01,534
And I'm going to say it in my own words this time!

849
01:35:06,498 --> 01:35:09,542
Wait a minute fellow. My Uncle wants to talk to you.

850
01:35:10,126 --> 01:35:13,463
Now listen to me my son. Before you lose your head
completely...

851
01:35:14,089 --> 01:35:18,510
may I remind you that I picked you up out of the gutter
and I can throw you right back there again!

852
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:26,976
You got a nerve accusing people of things. These
gentlemen and I know what's best for the John Does
of America, regardless of what tramps like you think!

853
01:35:28,603 --> 01:35:34,150
Get off that righteous horse of yours, and come to
your senses. You're the fake. We believe what we
are doing.

854
01:35:34,984 --> 01:35:38,947
You're the one that was paid the 30 pieces of silver.
Have you forgotten that? Well, I haven't.

855
01:35:39,489 --> 01:35:42,158
You're a fake John Doe, and I can prove it.

856
01:35:42,784 --> 01:35:45,829
You're the big hero that is suppose to jump of
buildings and things.

857
01:35:46,621 --> 01:35:51,501
Do you remember? What do you think your precious
John Does will think, when they find out that you had
no intention of doing it?

858
01:35:52,127 --> 01:35:56,131
That you were being paid to say so. You'd be lucky
they don't run you out of the country

859
01:35:56,631 --> 01:36:01,177
With the newspapers and radio stations that these
gentlemen control,

860
01:36:01,678 --> 01:36:05,849
we can kill the John Doe movement deader than a
doornail and we'll do it too, the minute you step out of
line.

861
01:36:06,850 --> 01:36:10,729
Now if you still want to go to that convention and
shoot your trap off, you go ahead and do it.

862
01:36:19,195 --> 01:36:23,366
You mean to tell me, that you would kill the John Doe
movement if you can't use it for what you want?

863
01:36:24,451 --> 01:36:26,244
You bet your bottom dollar we would!

864
01:36:32,584 --> 01:36:34,836
Well that certainly is a new low

865
01:36:36,421 --> 01:36:38,882
I guess I've seen everything now.

866
01:36:40,842 --> 01:36:46,681
You sit there smoking your big cigars, and think of
deliberatly killilng an idea that has made millions of
people a little bit happier.

867
01:36:47,307 --> 01:36:53,855
An idea that has brought thousands of them here from
all over the country. By bus, by freight and jalopys...

868
01:36:54,481 --> 01:36:58,234
So they could pass on to each other, their own simple
little experiences.

869
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:03,948
I'm just a mug and I know it. But I'm beginning to
understand a lot of things.

870
01:37:04,491 --> 01:37:09,871
Why your types are as old as history If you can't lay
your dirty fingers on a decent idea, and turn it and
squeeze it...

871
01:37:10,538 --> 01:37:14,834
...and put it into your own pocket, you slap it down!
Like dogs! If you can't eat something you bury it!

872
01:37:16,252 --> 01:37:21,883
Why this is the one worth while thing that has come
along. People are finally finding out that the guy next
door isn't the bad egg.

873
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:28,014
Simple isn't it? And a thing like that has got a chance
of spreading until it touches every dog-gone human
being in the world.

874
01:37:28,431 --> 01:37:32,644
And you talk about killing it. Or when this fire dies
down, what's going to be left?

875
01:37:33,395 --> 01:37:37,941
More misery, more hunger and more hate. And
what's to prevent that from starting all over again?!

876
01:37:38,900 --> 01:37:43,321
No one knows the answer to that one. And certainly
not you, with the slimy ideas you've got.

877
01:37:43,947 --> 01:37:48,702
The John Doe idea may be the answer though.

878
01:37:49,202 --> 01:37:52,872
Yet you sit on your fat hulks and tell me kill it if you
can't use it.

879
01:37:53,623 --> 01:37:58,712
You go ahead and try. You couldn't do it in a milion
years with all your radio stations and all your power...

880
01:37:59,337 --> 01:38:03,758
because it's bigger than whether I'm a fake, it's bigger
than your ambitions and it's bigger than all the
bracelets and fur coats in the world.

881
01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:07,846
- You bet it is John!
- And that's exactly what I am going down there to tell
those people!

882
01:38:11,850 --> 01:38:14,894
Why you ungrateful rat. My Uncle has been too good
to you.

883
01:38:16,813 --> 01:38:18,273
He's getting away.

884
01:38:22,193 --> 01:38:23,319
John...

885
01:38:24,070 --> 01:38:26,197
I tried to warn you D.B. You played with dynomite.

886
01:38:28,575 --> 01:38:30,243
Don't let him get away!

887
01:38:33,413 --> 01:38:35,415
I'll stop hlm cold. Don'tworry, I've been ready forthisl

888
01:38:36,916 --> 01:38:42,255
John! Oh John please listen to me. I didn't know
what they were going to do. Let me go with you
John...

889
01:38:45,175 --> 01:38:46,968
Go ahead driver.

890
01:38:52,307 --> 01:38:53,767
Mr. Norten wants to see you.

891
01:38:54,517 --> 01:38:57,645
Listen to me Mayor and you do what I say. I want
them both arrested.

892
01:38:58,146 --> 01:39:03,026
You tell the police to pick up Connell, I've got the girl
here. I don't care what you charge them with, but
keep them in jail overnight.

893
01:39:04,527 --> 01:39:06,654
Hello Bulletin, put your editor on.

894
01:39:57,205 --> 01:40:00,250
Three cheers for John Doe!

895
01:40:52,927 --> 01:40:57,682
- Ladies and Gentlemen.
- One moment John. We'll begin with a prayer.

896
01:41:02,187 --> 01:41:03,855
Quiet please.

897
01:41:04,689 --> 01:41:11,446
Ladies and gentlemen, let us have a moment of silent
prayer for the John Does all over the world.

898
01:41:12,739 --> 01:41:16,701
Many of whom are homeless and hungry

899
01:41:18,787 --> 01:41:22,749
Quiet please. Everybody rise.

900
01:42:14,175 --> 01:42:17,846
Newsboys, hundreds of newsboys are swarming into
the stadium.

901
01:42:18,596 --> 01:42:21,641
Yelling John Doe is a fake.

902
01:42:32,652 --> 01:42:35,697
An investigation by the Chamber of Commerce.

903
01:42:35,947 --> 01:42:38,408
Must be some kind of a gag.

904
01:42:52,130 --> 01:42:54,215
Come on, come on, step on it.

905
01:42:56,926 --> 01:42:58,511
You all know your places, so let's get going.

906
01:42:59,054 --> 01:43:01,389
- Will you autograph my balloon?
- Sure.

907
01:43:11,024 --> 01:43:16,196
Ladies and gentlemen. This is exactly what I came
down here to tell you about.

908
01:43:18,948 --> 01:43:23,244
Please, if you just be quiet for a few minutes, I can
explain the whole thing.

909
01:43:25,622 --> 01:43:29,417
As you know, this paper is published by D.B. Norten.

910
01:43:32,671 --> 01:43:36,549
Wait a minute. Wait a minute everybody.

911
01:43:38,843 --> 01:43:41,888
My name is D.B. Norten. You all know me.

912
01:43:42,681 --> 01:43:46,893
I accuse this man of being a faker. We've been taken
for suckers and I'm the biggest of the lot.

913
01:43:46,893 --> 01:43:48,186
I accuse this man of being a faker. We've been taken
for suckers and I'm the biggest of the lot.

914
01:43:48,186 --> 01:43:53,817
I spent a fortune backing this man, in what I believed
to be a sincere and worthy cause, just as you all did...

915
01:43:54,567 --> 01:43:59,322
And now I find out it nothing but a cheap racket.
Cooked up by him and two of my employees.

916
01:44:00,073 --> 01:44:03,118
For the sole purpose of collecting dues from the John
Does all over the country.

917
01:44:03,576 --> 01:44:08,540
- That's a lie!
- It's not a lie. Nickles and dimes being stufed into
thier own pockets. You can read all about it in the
newspapers.

918
01:44:09,082 --> 01:44:13,920
- That's a lie!...
- This man had no intention ofjumping of the top of a
building.

919
01:44:14,546 --> 01:44:18,216
- He was paid to say so. Do you deny that?
- That's got nothing to do with it.

920
01:44:18,758 --> 01:44:20,969
- Were you paid for it, or weren't you?
- Yes, I was paid, but...

921
01:44:21,594 --> 01:44:24,055
- And what about the sucide note? You didn't write
that either.
- What difference does that make?

922
01:44:24,681 --> 01:44:27,142
- Did you write it or didn't you?
- No I didn't write it.

923
01:44:27,851 --> 01:44:32,856
You look in your papers Ladies and Gentlemen, and
you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed confessioin that she's
the one that wrote it.

924
01:44:33,481 --> 01:44:37,902
- Listen folks, it's true that I didn't write the letter, but.
- See, he even admits he didn't write it. You're a fake
John Doe.

925
01:44:38,737 --> 01:44:44,075
And for what you've done to all these good people,
they ought to run you out of the country and I hope
they do it.

926
01:44:54,127 --> 01:44:56,046
Speak up John. We believe you.

927
01:44:56,796 --> 01:45:01,634
Listen folks. Now that he's finished shooting off, I've
got a few things to tell you.

928
01:45:03,386 --> 01:45:05,180
Get him out of here.

929
01:45:06,222 --> 01:45:09,684
I'm sorry folks, but we can't hear him anymore. There
is something wrong with the loud-speakers.

930
01:45:11,311 --> 01:45:15,273
- John Doe's a fake! Booooooo!
- Please, they can't hear me.

931
01:45:17,984 --> 01:45:21,029
This thing is not working. Ladies and Gentlemen.

932
01:45:39,214 --> 01:45:41,675
This thing is bigger than whether I'm a fake...

933
01:45:43,927 --> 01:45:46,137
You believe me?

934
01:45:47,347 --> 01:45:52,644
Sure I believe you. Walking my legs off, picking up
5000 signatures for a phony.

935
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:58,274
Well here you are Mr. Doe. 5000 names asking you
not to jump off any roof.

936
01:45:58,900 --> 01:46:03,655
- It makes no difference! The idea is still good.
- We don't have to give up our club. Yeah, well you
can have it.

937
01:46:07,575 --> 01:46:11,913
They're starting to throw things. Someone is going to
get hurt and I'm afraid it will be John Doe.

938
01:46:12,622 --> 01:46:14,749
- Listen to that crowd!

939
01:46:16,376 --> 01:46:20,380
- I've got to go there.
- Sorry lady, orders.

940
01:46:21,214 --> 01:46:25,635
Please let me go. They are crucifying him. I can help
him!

941
01:46:26,261 --> 01:46:29,597
- We've got orders to hold you.
- Orders from who? Can't you see it's a frame-up?

942
01:46:30,557 --> 01:46:33,601
Oh mother, they won't let me go, they won't let me go.

943
01:46:36,187 --> 01:46:39,232
Listen to me. You've got to listen to me.

944
01:46:40,358 --> 01:46:42,235
Back to the jungle, you hobo!

945
01:46:44,863 --> 01:46:47,907
- Trust a low-racket?
- Why shoud we do that?

946
01:46:58,168 --> 01:47:00,170
Stick to your clubs? The idea is still good.

947
01:47:02,339 --> 01:47:03,465
Believe me folks!

948
01:47:06,718 --> 01:47:09,054
Listen, John Doe is the only hope for the world.

949
01:47:45,423 --> 01:47:49,761
They managed to get him out of the park. If that boy
isn't hurt, it's a miracle!

950
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:53,765
This certainly looks like the end of the John Doe
movement.

951
01:47:55,433 --> 01:47:59,187
Well boys, you can chalk up another one to the
Pontius Pilots.

952
01:48:06,778 --> 01:48:09,823
I should have been there. I could have helped him.

953
01:48:12,701 --> 01:48:14,577
He was so all alone.

954
01:48:17,872 --> 01:48:23,837
A lot of us are going to be mighty ashamed of
ourselves after tonight. We certainly didn't give that
man much of a chance.

955
01:48:34,139 --> 01:48:38,101
- Would you like some more coffee Long John?
- No thanks Colonel.

956
01:48:47,652 --> 01:48:50,697
John Doe Proven Faker!

957
01:49:01,499 --> 01:49:06,379
Liar! Cheat! Lmposter! Why don't you jump? Cause
it ain't midnight...

958
01:49:08,757 --> 01:49:11,801
Good-bye Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man!

959
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:15,180
You are a wonderful man Mr. Doe

960
01:49:16,473 --> 01:49:18,683
Now get in there and pitch.

961
01:49:20,435 --> 01:49:22,103
FAKE!

962
01:49:22,604 --> 01:49:27,150
You're a fake John Doe and I can prove it. You're the
hero that's suppose to jump of tall buildings and
things.

963
01:49:28,026 --> 01:49:33,740
What do you think your precious John Does will think,
when they find out that you had no intention of doing
it?

964
01:49:34,282 --> 01:49:37,160
- That you were paid for the whole thing?
- Christmas Eve at midnight.

965
01:50:01,101 --> 01:50:04,979
- Silent Night.
- Holy Night...

966
01:50:32,966 --> 01:50:37,095
- John Doe? Is that screwball still around?

967
01:50:37,595 --> 01:50:43,685
- Yeah, that dame has been calling all day
- Sure, sure, at midnight huh?

968
01:50:44,644 --> 01:50:47,063
We'll have the place surrounded with nets.

969
01:50:48,273 --> 01:50:50,066
They're laughing at me.

970
01:50:55,405 --> 01:50:58,450
You're a sick girlAnne. You'd better take it easy.

971
01:51:00,702 --> 01:51:05,665
Who are you calling now? You called that number,
not more than 10 minutes ago.

972
01:51:06,750 --> 01:51:12,255
- Hello Mr. Connell, have you seen him yet?
- Now listen Anne, he can't possibly get in without our
seeing him...

973
01:51:13,131 --> 01:51:16,676
I'm watching the side door and the Colonel is out
front, so stop worrying.

974
01:51:19,471 --> 01:51:20,930
Thank-you.

975
01:51:26,519 --> 01:51:29,564
Ann! Don't be foolish.

976
01:51:33,026 --> 01:51:36,905
If this isn't the craziest, the battiest, the looniest, wild
goose chase I've ever heard of.

977
01:51:37,614 --> 01:51:41,284
- Oh shut up Bert,
- Sourpuss is right. Well if he is, I'm a banana split.

978
01:51:41,910 --> 01:51:46,331
That man is going to be on that roof. Don't ask me
how I know, I just know and you know it as well as I
do!

979
01:51:46,873 --> 01:51:50,377
Sure, sure, I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but the guy
is a fake and he isn't going to jump of any roof.

980
01:51:50,377 --> 01:51:51,586
Sure, sure, I'd like to believe in fairy tales, but the guy
is a fake and he isn't going to jump of any roof.

981
01:51:51,586 --> 01:51:55,674
I don't think he was any fake, not with that face!
Anyway, what he stood for wasn't a fake.

982
01:51:56,424 --> 01:51:57,884
Okay honey, Okay.

983
01:52:16,778 --> 01:52:21,741
The elavators ain't running. Colonel! You shouldn't
have gotten out of bed Miss.

984
01:52:22,492 --> 01:52:25,161
- Has he been here.
- Have you seen him? Nope, haven't seen him for a
week.

985
01:52:25,578 --> 01:52:27,580
- Where's Connell?
- He's watching the other door.

986
01:52:28,206 --> 01:52:29,666
You're swell.

987
01:52:34,796 --> 01:52:37,257
No sense in going up there. I've been here for hours
and he ain't here.

988
01:52:37,674 --> 01:52:39,009
Let me go!

989
01:52:43,138 --> 01:52:46,182
Now that's crazy. It's 14 floors.

990
01:53:29,100 --> 01:53:32,145
This is as far as the elavator goes. We have to walk
up to the tower.

991
01:54:23,196 --> 01:54:26,241
That crank is probably full of Christmas cheer and is
asleep in some flop-house.

992
01:54:26,950 --> 01:54:28,952
Let's go, I've got to decorate my tree.

993
01:54:41,339 --> 01:54:45,969
Well I give up. I don't know what gave us the idea
that he would attempt anything like this.

994
01:54:48,054 --> 01:54:51,391
I guess you're right. I guess the jokes on us. Let's
go!

995
01:54:52,017 --> 01:54:54,019
I hope nobody finds out we've been here.

996
01:56:37,330 --> 01:56:40,375
I wouldn't do that if I were you John.

997
01:56:51,177 --> 01:56:55,515
It'll do you now good. The Mayor has policemen
downstairs.

998
01:56:56,558 --> 01:57:00,437
With instructions to remove all marks of identification
that you may have on your person.

999
01:57:02,397 --> 01:57:06,151
You'll be buried in Potter's Field, and you will have
accomplished nothing.

1000
01:57:16,911 --> 01:57:22,876
I've taken care of that. I've already mailed a copy of
this letter to Mr. Connell.

1001
01:57:26,713 --> 01:57:31,551
- John why don't you forget this foolishness. Stop
right where you are Mr. Norten, if you don't want to go
over with me.

1002
01:57:36,681 --> 01:57:39,726
I'm glad you gentlemen are here.

1003
01:57:41,311 --> 01:57:46,274
You killed the John Doe movement all right. But
you're going to see it born all over again.

1004
01:57:55,075 --> 01:57:57,702
Now take a good look Mr. Norten.

1005
01:57:58,370 --> 01:57:59,704
John...

1006
01:58:00,538 --> 01:58:05,543
John... Oh John... I won't let you do it. I love you!

1007
01:58:09,255 --> 01:58:12,300
Please don't give up. We'll start all over again...

1008
01:58:12,967 --> 01:58:16,971
Just you and I. It isn't too late. The John Doe
movement isn't dead yet.

1009
01:58:18,473 --> 01:58:22,018
You see it isn't dead, or they wouldn't be here. It's
alive in me!

1010
01:58:22,644 --> 01:58:25,689
They kept it alive by being up here!

1011
01:58:27,273 --> 01:58:32,779
Darling! It should have been killed but it wasn't. We
can start clean now.

1012
01:58:33,530 --> 01:58:39,411
Just you and I. It'll grow lt'll grow big John, cause it
will be honest and kind.

1013
01:58:40,787 --> 01:58:44,666
Oh John, if it's worth dying for, it's worth living for.

1014
01:58:45,625 --> 01:58:48,670
Oh please John!

1015
01:58:58,179 --> 01:59:02,058
John look at me. You want to be honest don't you?

1016
01:59:02,684 --> 01:59:07,313
You don't have to die to keep the John Doe idea alive.
Someone already died for that one.

1017
01:59:08,064 --> 01:59:12,360
The first John Doe. And he's kept that idea alive for
nearly 2000 years!

1018
01:59:13,111 --> 01:59:17,115
It was He who kept it alive in them and He'll go on
keeping it alive in them.

1019
01:59:18,074 --> 01:59:27,876
For every John Doe movement these men kill, a new
one will be born.

1020
01:59:29,627 --> 01:59:33,590
Oh don't you see darling? This is no time to give up!

1021
01:59:34,341 --> 01:59:38,887
You and I John, we... Oh no, no John!

1022
01:59:39,721 --> 01:59:42,515
If you die, I want to die too.

1023
01:59:44,434 --> 01:59:46,686
I love you!

1024
01:59:59,949 --> 02:00:05,246
Mr. Doe... you don't have to... We're with you Mr.
Doe...

1025
02:00:07,207 --> 02:00:11,628
- We just lost our heads, and acted like a mob...
- What Bert's trying to say is, we need you Mr. Doe.

1026
02:00:12,587 --> 02:00:17,133
There was a lot of us who didn't believe what that
man said. We were going to start up our John Doe
club again.

1027
02:00:17,759 --> 02:00:21,638
Whether we saw you or not. And there are a lot of
others who are going to do the same thing...

1028
02:00:22,722 --> 02:00:26,476
- Mr. Sourpuss even got a letter from cousin inToledo
and...
- Got it right here Mr. Doe.

1029
02:00:26,976 --> 02:00:29,437
Only it would be a lot easier with you.

1030
02:00:32,941 --> 02:00:34,943
Please come with us Mr. Doe.

1031
02:01:00,510 --> 02:01:05,390
John! Mr. Doe... she's Okay.

1032
02:01:05,807 --> 02:01:07,559
We'll take her down to the car.

1033
02:01:10,186 --> 02:01:13,523
They you are Norten, the people! Try and lick that!
