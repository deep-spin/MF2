1
00:00:02,704 --> 00:00:06,454
(triumphant musical fanfare)

2
00:00:13,256 --> 00:00:15,839
(gentle music)

3
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:06,226
(upbeat music)

4
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:18,498
(saws scraping)

5
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,150
- What ya looking at?

6
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:34,650
- Nothing.

7
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,483
What's that for?

8
00:01:35,483 --> 00:01:36,316
- For nothing.

9
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:38,450
Next time ya want to look at
me, line forms to the right.

10
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,790
Two bits admission.

11
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,880
- Oh Monk, what do ya want us to do?

12
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,240
Walk around you with blinkers on?

13
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,690
- I don't want guys
looking at me, special,

14
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,380
like it was the first time they see me.

15
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,900
You see this?

16
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,630
- Yeah but I got one too.

17
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,480
- Any time you want to use
it, my office is in the gutter

18
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,670
and next time you take
a special look at me

19
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,280
think of this, suddenly
you don't see Monk,

20
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,450
you see stars.

21
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,803
Eh you push the saw for a while.

22
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,620
Copper?

23
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,360
- No it's cold out there.

24
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,240
- Then stay in here.

25
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,760
If it's too cold for you,
it's too cold for the law.

26
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,130
After all he's only
wearing woman underwear

27
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,890
and a 15-pound overcoat.

28
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,720
- Yeah but what if one does come by?

29
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,370
- Angelo take it from me,
the law won't make it.

30
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,660
There's too much
interference on this block.

31
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,590
First he stops the Pacino saloon,

32
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,370
on a cold day the law needs a shot.

33
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,290
- All right big shot, cut the flapping

34
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,910
and give me a hand here.

35
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,630
Mine's falling off.

36
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,463
- Come on Joey.

37
00:02:32,463 --> 00:02:33,400
- [Joey] Yeah, okay Monk.

38
00:02:37,197 --> 00:02:39,864
(saws scraping)

39
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,030
- Good evening, boys.

40
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,460
- What do you want Father?

41
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,550
- I swore to myself I'd never let anything

42
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,980
in this neighborhood surprise me

43
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,660
but tell me in the name of Heaven

44
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,930
what are you gonna do with a staircase?

45
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,760
We're freezing Father,
freezing we are all of us all.

46
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,990
- Oh this is for firewood
but this is just kindling.

47
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,540
- So we use this up, so we get more.

48
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,420
- Well what about the tenants

49
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,320
who still live in the building?

50
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,680
But you are destroying
the landlord's property.

51
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,350
- Look Father, this is
a condemned tenement,

52
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,960
you know what that means?

53
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,870
Any rent the landlord gets
from this trap is velvet.

54
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,290
- [Father] But you're breaking the law.

55
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,683
- Nobody's seen us, nobody but you.

56
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,800
- Listen boys, I've got a
better way for you to keep warm.

57
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,270
In the basement of the church
there's some gym equipment,

58
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,563
boxing gloves, wrestling
mats, punching bag,

59
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,103
even shower baths.

60
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,860
It is also steam-heated.

61
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,693
You're all welcome.

62
00:03:41,693 --> 00:03:42,780
- So great,

63
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,300
what about the old man, the old lady?

64
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,700
They're freezing too.

65
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,100
- I'm sure they'd rather stay cold

66
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,643
then get hot digging up
bail money for you boys.

67
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:55,163
- Okay Father, you make sense.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,530
We'll go over to the church.

69
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,010
You can't talk for all of Billy Goats

70
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,379
without us taking a vote on it.

71
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:01,528
- Who says I can't?
- I say--

72
00:04:01,528 --> 00:04:02,410
- Boys!

73
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:05,330
Settle it your own way
but do it peacefully.

74
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:07,080
Remember the invitation is for all.

75
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,977
I am new at St Dominic's

76
00:04:08,977 --> 00:04:11,577
and this might be a chance
for us to get acquainted.

77
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:14,230
I'll be looking for you.

78
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,953
- Before we go we might as
well divvy up the wood we got.

79
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,363
What goes here?

80
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:27,548
A minute ago we had a whole stack of wood.

81
00:04:27,548 --> 00:04:30,298
(playful music)

82
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,090
- Hey Monk, that's mine.

83
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,670
I took 'em on my own time
from Brushetto's Market.

84
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,904
- That's what you get
for holding out on us.

85
00:04:46,904 --> 00:04:49,571
(playful music)

86
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,063
- Anybody care for some mustard?

87
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,330
- He's late again.

88
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,513
I don't like it.

89
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,411
I don't like my son to become bandido.

90
00:05:07,411 --> 00:05:08,940
- Be calm Gino.

91
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,360
Maybe he's look for wood.

92
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,570
- Yeah.

93
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,920
The way he's looking for
wood, he find trouble.

94
00:05:20,998 --> 00:05:23,030
Where you steal that bandido?

95
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,320
- Paul, did you steal it?

96
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,906
- No, always you think the worst of me.

97
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:28,659
Some day I'm going to--
- Don't talk back!

98
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:30,520
Said keep still!
- You hit me once more,

99
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,280
you'll never see me here no more.

100
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,523
- Please, please!

101
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,370
- No Mama Mia.

102
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,380
This was given to me by the
new priest at St. Dominic's.

103
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,506
I helped him clean out the church.

104
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:43,700
(speaks in foreign language)

105
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,430
- Then it's alright.

106
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,280
- I had some wood I'd give to Angelo.

107
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:52,354
(gentle music)

108
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,580
- This new priest, he's Irish, huh?

109
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,140
- Yeah, he's a young guy.

110
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,460
- Why not stay with his own people?

111
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,940
Little Italy is for Italians.

112
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:29,923
- Gino, do not speak so of a priest.

113
00:06:31,697 --> 00:06:33,123
He's give us coal.

114
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:39,389
Maybe he's get a job for Paulo, huh?

115
00:06:39,389 --> 00:06:40,257
- Yeah.

116
00:06:40,257 --> 00:06:41,407
- And he's teaching me.

117
00:06:48,897 --> 00:06:50,689
- Lord, bless you.

118
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:51,939
And through us.

119
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:55,954
(Paul praying quietly)

120
00:06:55,954 --> 00:06:58,840
- This is priest, what
he teaching, you, huh?

121
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,080
- Oh, things.

122
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,710
- He explain the good book to you.

123
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:05,692
He makes you say over
the 10 Commandments, huh?

124
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,200
- What's the difference?

125
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,790
He's teaching me.

126
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,373
(gentle music)

127
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:17,443
(traffic humming)

128
00:07:26,438 --> 00:07:28,337
- Here let me show you.

129
00:07:28,337 --> 00:07:29,523
- Oh, go ahead.

130
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:31,860
- Only a mutton head would
get mad at a punching bag.

131
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,210
It isn't as if it had a will of its own.

132
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,110
- It's tricky.

133
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,090
- Only because you don't how to handle it.

134
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,550
First you sort of coax it.

135
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,390
- I'll never be any good
at this coaxing stuff.

136
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,750
- Well you'll have to learn.

137
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,890
All you boys around here

138
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,390
think fighting means killing somebody.

139
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,240
- That's right.

140
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,430
This block you turn your head
you're just asking for it.

141
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:48,443
- But the science of boxing
will teach you that--

142
00:07:48,443 --> 00:07:49,870
- Aw, you don't have to
teach me how to fight.

143
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,280
I can take care of myself.

144
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,800
- In a street brawl.

145
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,670
- On the roof, in a dark
hallway, the subway,

146
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,010
the park, anywheres.

147
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,053
- Wherever there's three of you to one.

148
00:07:57,053 --> 00:07:59,320
- I don't need any extra help.

149
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,110
- Good, perhaps you'd
like to prove it to me.

150
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:02,943
Angelo.

151
00:08:02,943 --> 00:08:04,150
- Yes, Father.

152
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,260
- Oh, I wouldn't lay a hand on no Father.

153
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,093
- Well I'm glad to see that

154
00:08:08,093 --> 00:08:09,840
you have so much respect for the cloth

155
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,290
but just the same I
think you're about ready

156
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,280
for your first boxing lesson, come on.

157
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,775
- Look Father, I don't want to fight ya.

158
00:08:14,775 --> 00:08:16,390
I'll hurt ya or something.

159
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,851
- He'll hurt you, Father.
- He sure will!

160
00:08:17,851 --> 00:08:18,730
He hits so hard.

161
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:19,563
- You let me worry about that.

162
00:08:19,563 --> 00:08:21,230
You just try to take care of yourself.

163
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:23,910
We're trying to prove that a
human being can protect himself

164
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,410
without killing his opponent.

165
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,740
Come on, get on to the mat and
fight like a man, not an ape.

166
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,140
- [Paul] Just remember
Father, you asked for it.

167
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,933
- Come on, Monk.

168
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,330
- [Paul] Father I gotta know,
what did you hit me with?

169
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,860
- That my boy was sort of an

170
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,290
extracurricular part of
my religious training,

171
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,883
better known as a left jab.

172
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,340
It has a definite value

173
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,740
convincing certain types of unbelievers,

174
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,040
convinced your friends, it convinced you.

175
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,477
- [Paul] Will you teach me that?

176
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:20,633
- Indeed I will.

177
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,910
Sometimes in anger one forgets the Lord

178
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,010
but never the knack of throwing a left jab

179
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:32,093
and Paul, I called you
Monk to prove a point.

180
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,000
You're gonna have to live with the face,

181
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,710
I know you're sensitive about your looks

182
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,610
but your face is God's dispensation

183
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:43,520
and you can't escape it
by brutally beating up

184
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,303
everything in the world that
looks at you or dislikes it.

185
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,424
- Yeah, I guess so Father.

186
00:09:49,424 --> 00:09:50,720
(gentle music)

187
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,633
It's just that I get mad
anytime anybody makes cracks.

188
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:59,810
When I was a kid none of the
other kids would play with me.

189
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,800
The neighbors would look at me

190
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,650
like I had the evil eye or something.

191
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,000
Father, I'm 19 years old going on 20.

192
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,190
Nobody can look at me straight,

193
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,763
no girl even comes near me.

194
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,850
Angelo's the only one
ever really was my friend,

195
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,083
face and no face.

196
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,426
Tell me Father Callaghan,

197
00:10:21,426 --> 00:10:24,320
don't it make you feel
different to have to talk to me

198
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,313
and look at this?

199
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,003
- No, no I can honestly
say it makes no difference.

200
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:37,513
Paul, a man's face is
such an external thing,

201
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:42,950
like his skin being red, or
brown, or black, or white,

202
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,033
like his hair being long or short.

203
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,170
These things are the covering of a man

204
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,280
and after all I'm mainly concerned

205
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,143
with the deepest inside part of it.

206
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:57,100
Many people suffer because
their, their color,

207
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,640
or their size, or their shape,

208
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,557
or the kind of face
they have is different,

209
00:11:01,557 --> 00:11:04,007
but the most important
thing to remember is this,

210
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,860
if you hate your face
because they hate it,

211
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,420
if you call yourself ugly

212
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,010
because some ignorant man called you ugly,

213
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,200
you're just as guilty as he is, guilty.

214
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,060
You simply have no right
to be so intolerant,

215
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,973
even of yourself.

216
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,943
Only Fools would laugh at you

217
00:11:23,943 --> 00:11:26,510
but you mustn't help
them by losing your head

218
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:31,220
and besides I don't think your
face is so ugly as all that.

219
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,360
After all I'm no beauty myself. (laughs)

220
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,400
And anyway, underneath it all

221
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,650
I think you're a pretty
nice guy, Paul Baroni

222
00:11:40,674 --> 00:11:43,424
and that's a lot more important
than being just pretty,

223
00:11:45,015 --> 00:11:46,210
and if you'll drop back tomorrow

224
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:48,495
why I'll show you exactly what hit you.

225
00:11:48,495 --> 00:11:51,078
(gentle music)

226
00:12:05,145 --> 00:12:08,260
- Now only a mutton head would
get mad at a punching bag.

227
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,313
You gotta coax it.

228
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,800
Stay with it you'll catch on.

229
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,650
Now all you guys are gonna
learn how to fight proper like,

230
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,923
off with the coat, Pete, you're next.

231
00:12:18,923 --> 00:12:19,756
- Aw no, Monk.

232
00:12:19,756 --> 00:12:21,223
- Come on, come on.

233
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:25,202
(wood thuds)

234
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,560
Now there'll be none of that Pete.

235
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,760
Father Callaghan was good
enough to let us use the place,

236
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,593
so leave the stuff alone.

237
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,220
All right, let's go.

238
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,100
Put up your guard.

239
00:12:53,456 --> 00:12:54,289
Now don't drop your guard

240
00:12:54,289 --> 00:12:56,810
just because I faint, try it again.

241
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,360
- Yeah but suppose I drop a
milk bottle on ya from the roof,

242
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,320
What good's this?

243
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,153
- We'll see.

244
00:13:02,155 --> 00:13:05,300
Now you see, sometimes
there's no milk bottle handy,

245
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,250
a left jab is your best friend.

246
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,233
- [Pete] Yeah.

247
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,710
- And this is our gym Miss Brooks.

248
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,770
Perhaps in time we can use
this as a recreation hall.

249
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,710
- It's large enough.

250
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,510
Of course you'll have to get some games

251
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,640
and some new equipment.

252
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,160
- You mean some new patrons.

253
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,980
Boys this is Miss Brooks,

254
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,060
who's coming down evenings to
work with our social program.

255
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:30,960
- Hi.

256
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,090
- Hello.

257
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,993
- Paul would you come here a minute?

258
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,710
I particularly want to
introduce you to Paul Baroni.

259
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,013
He's going to help me with
our physical culture program.

260
00:13:42,013 --> 00:13:43,670
- Oh.

261
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:44,780
- Pleased to meet you.

262
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,613
- Thank you.

263
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,290
I guess you and I will
be working together.

264
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,593
- Well I, I guess so.

265
00:14:06,302 --> 00:14:07,135
(Paul laughs)

266
00:14:07,135 --> 00:14:08,670
- Wow you couldn't do that last month.

267
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:09,720
- That's right Fater.

268
00:14:11,182 --> 00:14:12,259
What's that for?

269
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:14,600
- That's for calling me Fater.

270
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,330
Well we talked about this before.

271
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,958
You read the books I give
you without any trouble

272
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:21,470
but you still persist in
talking East 106th Street.

273
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,840
I know it's part of your
mechanism of being tough

274
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,100
but with my own ears I have
heard you pronounce words

275
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,370
like a human being.

276
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,720
- Well, hymns and prayers is different.

277
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,570
They're all printed in English

278
00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:34,440
and if you can say father in church

279
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,320
you can pronounce it correctly elsewhere.

280
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,663
- Okay Fater.

281
00:14:42,018 --> 00:14:44,851
(traffic humming)

282
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,530
- Now we can get out of the business.

283
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,260
Tell me, what's eating you?

284
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,250
- What?

285
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,910
- Don't try to kid me.

286
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,720
You've been fiddling around
here for the last half hour,

287
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,850
talking about this and that.

288
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,223
Let's stop beating around
the bush and get to it.

289
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,253
- Okay Father, I'll
give it to you straight.

290
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,113
I've been watching the services,

291
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:11,990
you know, listening and everything,

292
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,713
like I told you it gets
me, especially the singing.

293
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,000
Father, if you think I could

294
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,015
I'd like to try and sing in the choir.

295
00:15:25,015 --> 00:15:26,270
(Father laughs)

296
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,010
- Of course Paul, of course.

297
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,210
I wasn't laughing at you

298
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:33,590
but I am impressed by your courage.

299
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,340
Yes, your courage

300
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,740
and you certainly shall get a
chance to sing in the choir,

301
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,735
providing of course you can sing.

302
00:15:41,735 --> 00:15:44,535
Come on, we'll have the choir
master try your voice now.

303
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,033
- Hello, Mama.

304
00:15:56,402 --> 00:16:00,060
- Ah, I see father Callahan
teach you again today, huh?

305
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,670
- No Mama, today I study singing.

306
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,137
You cutting your faced with a high C?

307
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:05,040
- No, no.

308
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,030
The choir master says I got a voice,

309
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:09,270
kind of rough he says, but a baritone

310
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,870
and they need a baritone.

311
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,150
You see Mama, most the
kids are 11, 12 years old,

312
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,370
all they got is sopranos or altos.

313
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:18,270
Me, me, I'm a man.

314
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,620
I got a man's voice

315
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,840
and tomorrow Mama for the first time

316
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,772
I get to sing with the regular
choir in church at services.

317
00:16:25,772 --> 00:16:29,788
- Paulo, that's so good,
that's so good, Paulo.

318
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,932
♪ Morning ♪

319
00:16:31,932 --> 00:16:35,926
- Yeah, but we have rehearsal tomorrow,

320
00:16:35,926 --> 00:16:37,843
so we'll see how he is.

321
00:16:40,881 --> 00:16:42,975
(suspenseful music)

322
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:43,808
- Huh.

323
00:16:46,778 --> 00:16:47,611
What do you take Tony?

324
00:16:47,611 --> 00:16:52,560
Is it a dame or maybe it's
just Father Callahan's stooge?

325
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,970
- Why don't you guys beat it.

326
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,180
This is no place for a beef.

327
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,483
- Huh, ain't he pretty.

328
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,010
- Where'd you get the skirts Monk?

329
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,843
- We don't want a beef,
we would like a dance.

330
00:17:07,002 --> 00:17:08,299
How 'bout a date, Monk?

331
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:10,263
- Where's your organ grinder, Monk?

332
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:12,780
You got the face and the skirts for it.

333
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,490
All you need now is a tin cup.

334
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,323
- Monk!

335
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:17,100
You don't want to get
your lace panties dirty.

336
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,110
- Hold it, will ya?

337
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,080
- What's the matter Angie?

338
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,388
You losing your nerve?

339
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:22,600
- Listen you guys, Monk
ain't done nothing to nobody.

340
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,070
- What do you mean he ain't done nothin'?

341
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,620
He quit, didn't he?

342
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,870
You know we got a rule,
nobody quits the Goats,

343
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,470
not and gets away with it, huh fellas?

344
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,303
- That's right.
- Yeah.

345
00:17:31,303 --> 00:17:34,170
- Now look at him, Callahan's sissy,

346
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,890
and we let him push us around, tough guy.

347
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,702
Monk Baroni, look at him.

348
00:17:40,702 --> 00:17:42,324
Come on, fellas, let's get him.

349
00:17:42,324 --> 00:17:44,625
(suspenseful music)

350
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:47,375
(boys screaming)

351
00:17:52,161 --> 00:17:53,366
Ow!

352
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:54,407
Uh, ow!

353
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,603
(boys grunting)

354
00:17:56,603 --> 00:17:57,436
- Paul!

355
00:18:02,577 --> 00:18:03,915
- What did I do?

356
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:05,681
- Monk.

357
00:18:05,681 --> 00:18:08,353
- It was an accident, I didn't mean it.

358
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,571
It was an accident.

359
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:11,659
- Help, murder, help police!

360
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:14,260
- Monk, get going, Monk.

361
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,241
You gotta get outta here.

362
00:18:16,241 --> 00:18:17,291
- It was an accident.

363
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:20,283
- Look, Monk, you ain't kid.

364
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,500
Nobody's gonna believe
it was any accident.

365
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,440
The cops still remember ya.

366
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,740
Father Callahan ain't gonna be here

367
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,810
to put in a good word for ya.

368
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,430
Monk you gotta get out of
here, to the coal yard!

369
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,230
Hide there, I'll come later tonight.

370
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:34,737
Now get going.

371
00:18:34,737 --> 00:18:36,017
(suspenseful music)

372
00:18:36,017 --> 00:18:38,850
(whistle blowing)

373
00:18:40,698 --> 00:18:43,281
(somber music)

374
00:18:45,203 --> 00:18:48,036
(train whistling)

375
00:18:54,928 --> 00:18:57,928
(suspenseful music)

376
00:19:03,382 --> 00:19:04,632
- Angie, Angie.

377
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,707
- Monk, I'm glad I found ya.

378
00:19:07,707 --> 00:19:09,690
Here's some chocolate and your coat.

379
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,530
It's all I could get.

380
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,530
- How is he?

381
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,480
- Go ahead and eat.

382
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:16,550
They took him to the hospital.

383
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,150
He's hurt but he's okay.

384
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,983
- You sure?

385
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:19,816
- Sure.

386
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,930
Monk you got to stay away off the block.

387
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:25,883
You can't go home.

388
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,180
- The only guy ever did me a good turn

389
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,530
and I sent to the hospital.

390
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,690
This kisser of mine, this Ape's face.

391
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,080
Monk, Monk Baroni, it's a curse.

392
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,110
It's a curse from God.

393
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,968
It's bad luck for everybody I know.

394
00:19:43,968 --> 00:19:45,240
- Shh, Monk, hold it down.

395
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,190
You gotta get a hold of yourself.

396
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,500
We gotta figure what you're gonna do.

397
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,163
- With this face and these
fists, what can I do?

398
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:53,696
(audience chattering)

399
00:19:53,696 --> 00:19:54,837
(whistle blowing)

400
00:19:54,837 --> 00:19:58,004
(audience chattering)

401
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:03,408
(bell ringing)

402
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:06,099
(audience shouting)

403
00:20:06,099 --> 00:20:07,805
- [Audience Members] Boo!

404
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:08,638
Boo, Boo!

405
00:20:10,924 --> 00:20:11,757
Boo!

406
00:20:12,943 --> 00:20:14,943
- One, two, three, four.

407
00:20:16,868 --> 00:20:18,008
- [Audience Members] Boo!

408
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:18,841
- [Audience Member] Get up.

409
00:20:18,841 --> 00:20:20,749
- Boo!
- Get him, come on, get up!

410
00:20:20,749 --> 00:20:22,309
- Boo!
- Throw him out!

411
00:20:22,309 --> 00:20:23,230
- [Audience Member] Boo!

412
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,800
- Hey, where your table manners?

413
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,470
It's customary for a winner to help carry

414
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,954
his defeated upon to a corner.

415
00:20:27,954 --> 00:20:29,200
- Boo.
- Come on.

416
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,260
- Defeated opponent you can
lay there for all I care there.

417
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,994
They're booing me not him.

418
00:20:33,994 --> 00:20:36,049
- [Audience Members] Boo!

419
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:39,049
(audience shouting)

420
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:44,330
- What kind of watch
they give us this time?

421
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,243
- Same kind.

422
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,725
Imitation gold.

423
00:20:47,725 --> 00:20:48,630
(Monk scoffs)

424
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,130
- When we gonna finish with this imitation

425
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,630
and get into the real stuff?

426
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:52,503
- Soon, I hope.

427
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,640
- Well it's good for four bucks.

428
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,647
Say you and me split a steak

429
00:20:57,647 --> 00:20:59,197
and then we split a pool table.

430
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,373
Someday we get twin beds.

431
00:21:07,672 --> 00:21:10,089
(glass taps)

432
00:21:18,698 --> 00:21:20,531
- Oh no, oh no, don't,

433
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,890
don't tell me you're
bringing me another watch?

434
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,190
- That's all they give us.

435
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,970
- The other guy's silly,
you bust a knuckle,

436
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,570
all you get is a gold watch.

437
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:32,210
- All these watches
ticking away in my safe,

438
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,050
they're driving me crazy,

439
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,863
even if I can't hear them
they, they keep me awake.

440
00:21:37,832 --> 00:21:40,713
Oh, here you are.

441
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,900
There's one, two, three, four.

442
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:49,400
And don't bring me any more watches.

443
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,080
- We can't eat the springs.

444
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,723
- Well and why don't you
get wise to yourself.

445
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,243
Come here kid.

446
00:21:57,122 --> 00:22:00,010
You know, you must have
dynamite in those fists.

447
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:02,240
This is the sixth watch they've given you

448
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,040
in three weeks, isn't it?

449
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,142
- Mostly one round KOs.

450
00:22:06,142 --> 00:22:10,890
- Well then, why don't you
get wise and become a pro?

451
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:12,930
- That's easy to say but how?

452
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,810
The gyms are crawling with golden glovers.

453
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:17,000
We don't know anybody on the West Side.

454
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,710
Who do you see, who do you talk to?

455
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,483
- All right, so listen and I'll tell ya.

456
00:22:22,673 --> 00:22:25,843
Now you go up to Griffin's Private Gym,

457
00:22:25,843 --> 00:22:28,020
10th Avenue and 48th Street.

458
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,014
Walk-up one flight.

459
00:22:30,014 --> 00:22:32,847
(traffic humming)

460
00:22:35,401 --> 00:22:39,636
(punching bags slapping)

461
00:22:39,636 --> 00:22:40,980
- This is it.

462
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,777
- Yeah here's the saloon.

463
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:46,194
(punching bags slapping)

464
00:22:55,012 --> 00:22:58,012
(boxers chattering)

465
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,730
- Say, uh, bud, who is this Mr. Hellman?

466
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,340
- That's him over there with the glasses.

467
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,300
He's reading.

468
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,893
Yeah, he's always reading.

469
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:15,041
(boxers chattering)

470
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:20,400
- Could we talk to you, Mr. Hellman?

471
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,770
- Well that would depend I should say

472
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,543
on your arrange of conversation.

473
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,790
What would you like to discuss?

474
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,300
- Somebody told us to ask for ya.

475
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,170
- How cozy.

476
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,970
- But we're not supposed to say who.

477
00:23:32,821 --> 00:23:35,090
- Well if you tell me who, I might listen.

478
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,200
That's the first trait I like to

479
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,450
find in a fighter is treachery.

480
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,463
The ability to betray a confidence.

481
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,560
- Look Mr. Hellman, we ain't
good at this double-talk

482
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,810
but my buddy here's got the
makings of a good fighter.

483
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:48,643
- Why come to me?

484
00:23:48,643 --> 00:23:50,170
I'm a manager, I'm not a trainer.

485
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:53,093
- 'Cause Uncle won't take any
more imitation gold watches.

486
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,250
- You do much fighting?

487
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,520
- Six amateurs, won all six by knockouts.

488
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,310
- Look, I hate bragging,
just breathe easy boy

489
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,143
don't throw your chest out.

490
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:05,660
What's your name?

491
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,890
- Young Baroni.

492
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,650
- Young. (laughs)

493
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,690
Oh I bet that's a lie.

494
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,090
Why even those penny-ante fans

495
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,340
support those stupid amateurs

496
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,410
wouldn't stand still for
that physiognomy of yours

497
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:18,120
going under that banner. (laughs)

498
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,780
Young, hu-oh.

499
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,450
Why your old boy, your face is old.

500
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,040
It's, it's atavistic.

501
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,460
It's almost prehistoric.

502
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,350
Come on, give me the truth.

503
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,380
What name do you fight under?

504
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,100
Ape Baroni or Gorilla Baroni?

505
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,613
- It's monk, yeah Monk.

506
00:24:32,468 --> 00:24:34,800
- You know you mustn't
hit a man with glasses.

507
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,300
- Then don't needle my buddy.

508
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,850
- Teach him to control himself.

509
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,883
- Then talk to us like human beings.

510
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,793
- Why?

511
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,480
Look I hate to teach anybody anything

512
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,960
but there's one lesson
that I'll teach you,

513
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,200
never lose your temper except in the ring.

514
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,010
To most fighters I say
never lose your temper,

515
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:55,940
especially in the ring

516
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,970
but you, if you ever fight for me

517
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,010
that's where I want you to lose it.

518
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,190
I want you to snarl,
spit, show your fangs.

519
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:04,883
I want a real primitive show, Monk Baroni.

520
00:25:06,602 --> 00:25:08,910
- Okay, okay.

521
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,510
- Would you like to see him box?

522
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,280
- Well you said he'd win
his first six by knockout,

523
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,343
so let's see here.

524
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,943
Here we are.

525
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:25,730
Young Baroni, four knockouts,
two technical knockouts.

526
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:28,070
Young Baroni, well what do you know?

527
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,780
You boys must be new to the
fight game, you're honest.

528
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,245
- You mean you got a record on Monk?

529
00:25:32,245 --> 00:25:33,180
- Why certainly.

530
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,110
If I took the word of every would-be pug

531
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:35,943
that comes in here,

532
00:25:35,943 --> 00:25:38,853
I'd be spending 24 hours a
day listening to stumblebums.

533
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,010
Look here's 20 bucks, get
yourself a room at the Y

534
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,760
and supervise his training.

535
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,100
See that he runs around the reservoir,

536
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,750
does plenty of gym work.

537
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,600
Keep him in shape

538
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:53,930
but don't overfeed him, I want him hungry.

539
00:25:55,765 --> 00:25:56,815
And sign this receipt

540
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,733
'cause one way or another I
expect to get my money back.

541
00:26:02,362 --> 00:26:05,540
(boxers chattering)
(punching bags slapping)

542
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,900
- Then you're his manager?

543
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,420
- I'm his manager.

544
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,010
- How soon you want to see him?

545
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,310
- Keep him out of my sight

546
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,490
but you come back here in about a week

547
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,330
and I'll sign him up
for a four-round prelim

548
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,003
out of the Staten Island Arena.

549
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,440
At least I'll enjoy the ferry ride.

550
00:26:29,226 --> 00:26:32,063
(suspenseful music)

551
00:26:32,063 --> 00:26:35,063
(audience shouting_

552
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,077
(triumphant music)

553
00:26:45,887 --> 00:26:50,287
(audience shouting)
(suspenseful music)

554
00:26:50,287 --> 00:26:53,204
(triumphant music)

555
00:26:57,706 --> 00:27:00,810
(audience shouting)
(suspenseful music)

556
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:03,727
(triumphant music)

557
00:27:15,173 --> 00:27:18,006
(traffic humming)

558
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,790
- Hello, Mr. Baroni.

559
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,370
Your record from Italy
came in this morning.

560
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:29,420
Would you like to hear it?

561
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,255
- I sure would.

562
00:27:30,255 --> 00:27:32,672
- All right, right over here.

563
00:27:47,252 --> 00:27:50,002
(peaceful music)

564
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:57,606
(singing in foreign language)

565
00:28:00,951 --> 00:28:03,701
(peaceful music)

566
00:28:08,674 --> 00:28:12,591
(singing in foreign language)

567
00:28:25,173 --> 00:28:26,840
- Paul, how are you?

568
00:28:29,239 --> 00:28:32,270
- You, you still talk to me?

569
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,920
- I shouldn't for the length
of time you stayed away.

570
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,274
- Then you're not, you're not sore at me?

571
00:28:38,274 --> 00:28:39,330
- Not sore?

572
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:42,030
Come now, Paul, even a priest is human.

573
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,280
When the side of my head caved in

574
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,500
I could have throttled you.

575
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,290
- Honest I didn't mean it.

576
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:49,120
My head was full of stone,
I couldn't see who it was.

577
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,370
I was so mad, crazy mad.

578
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:53,080
- That scratch healed in due time

579
00:28:54,124 --> 00:28:55,290
but what I am angry about

580
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:58,120
is the fact that you stayed away so long.

581
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,860
- I was ashamed.

582
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,590
- I did get your conscience money

583
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,900
for the choirboys clothes.

584
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,000
In fact, I was able to
get six complete outfits.

585
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
- [Paul] That helps.

586
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,260
- I saw Angelo slipping
the money in the poor box.

587
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:14,150
He wasn't very clever
about sneaking it in.

588
00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:16,280
I saw him but I wouldn't go near him.

589
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:18,580
I wanted you to come
forward, not your stooge.

590
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,970
- [Paul] I, I just didn't have the nerve.

591
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,910
- It's all wiped out.

592
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,180
- Thanks.

593
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,580
- I see you're still
interested in church music.

594
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,670
- You got the goods on me.

595
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,000
- Yes and I intend to club you with it.

596
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,530
Paul I'm gonna send off a letter

597
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,800
to every sports writer in New York.

598
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,660
I can see the headlines now,

599
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,760
welterweight trains on Gregorian chants.

600
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,850
Yes I'm gonna resort to blackmail

601
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,720
if you don't come up and see us.

602
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,070
- You mean I can?

603
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,323
- I mean you must.

604
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,290
Why you ungrateful wretch.

605
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,480
Who do you think taught you
how to throw a left jab?

606
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,397
Every time I connect what I say,

607
00:29:56,397 --> 00:29:58,930
"Here's a message from Father Callahan."

608
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,160
- And you've been connecting, huh?

609
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,830
I've been reading about you.

610
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,410
Well here are your orders.

611
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:06,290
This very Saturday night,

612
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:09,260
in the gym where you first
learn to coax a punching bag

613
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,810
we're having a dance for
the friends of St. Dominick.

614
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,643
- A dance?

615
00:30:12,643 --> 00:30:14,690
- Oh yes, we've made a lot of progress.

616
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,660
You haven't seen the place in over a year,

617
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,530
you'll be delighted.

618
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,980
- I'll come.

619
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,200
- It'll cost you two bits.

620
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,580
- I'll pay at the door.

621
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,413
- Bring a girl.

622
00:30:22,413 --> 00:30:23,687
- Ain't got one.

623
00:30:23,687 --> 00:30:25,470
Well, huh, who's your manager?

624
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,810
- Four-eyed buzzard, name of Mr. Hellman.

625
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:29,110
- Bring him.

626
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,653
- He's my manager, not my friend.

627
00:30:34,135 --> 00:30:34,968
(peaceful music)

628
00:30:34,968 --> 00:30:36,500
I found out one thing,

629
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,233
in this racket you got no friends.

630
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,370
That's why when I'm alone

631
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:45,724
I'm glad I can listen to
a little church music.

632
00:30:45,724 --> 00:30:46,953
- I'm proud of you Paul.

633
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,193
You've grown, you've
matured, you've got values.

634
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:53,420
You'll be all right.

635
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,430
- I still get my block knocked off.

636
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,930
- You'll be all right.

637
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,430
If not as a fighter, as a man.

638
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,840
You know, you're somewhat of a celebrity

639
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,400
up on East 106th Street.

640
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,351
We'll all be glad to see ya.

641
00:31:04,351 --> 00:31:05,184
Saturday.

642
00:31:05,184 --> 00:31:06,649
- Okay Fater.

643
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:09,210
(Paul chuckles)

644
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:12,043
(peaceful music)

645
00:31:15,231 --> 00:31:18,231
(guests chattering)

646
00:31:20,625 --> 00:31:23,958
(twinkling piano music)

647
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:31,300
- Welcome home, Paul.

648
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,150
How are you Angelo?

649
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,340
- Just fine, Father.

650
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,490
It's good to be back.

651
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,540
- Place looks great.

652
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,230
- Oh this is just a start.

653
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,350
Someday perhaps we'll have

654
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,500
a recreation all big enough
for everyone in the community.

655
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,930
- How are the kids taken to it?

656
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,730
- That's where the real progress lies,

657
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,520
kindness can perform miracles.

658
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,980
- You're telling me.

659
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,320
- Well make yourself at home boys,

660
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,130
there's plenty of sandwiches,
and cookies, and fruit,

661
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:53,023
and, well I'm afraid you're a little late.

662
00:31:55,127 --> 00:31:57,413
There was plenty of
refreshment there a minute ago.

663
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:02,833
- Excuse me.

664
00:32:05,076 --> 00:32:08,429
(playful music)

665
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:11,000
Hi Pete, it's been a long time.

666
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,833
- Hi Monk.

667
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:13,689
- Just a second, Pete.

668
00:32:13,689 --> 00:32:16,356
(playful music)

669
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,130
Things don't change much, do they Pete?

670
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:40,363
But nice bumping into you, Pete.

671
00:32:40,363 --> 00:32:43,030
(playful music)

672
00:32:54,162 --> 00:32:55,320
- Ah that Pete.

673
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,290
I still have a ways to go with him.

674
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:59,480
Did you hear about him burning his coat?

675
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,400
- Say, I did notice his coat
had a small patch on it.

676
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,490
- That's it.

677
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,160
As near as I can understand it,

678
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,860
Pete was borrowing one of the
candle holders from the alter

679
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,480
when someone came in the door.

680
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,910
Now this caught Pete by surprise,

681
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:13,150
so he put the holder inside of his coat

682
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:15,110
while the candle was still burning.

683
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:17,309
(Paul and Angelo laughing)

684
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:19,330
- Well this sounds like a happy group.

685
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,989
- Boys, you remember Miss Brooks.

686
00:33:20,989 --> 00:33:22,000
- Hi.
- Hi.

687
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:22,833
- Hello.

688
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:23,910
- You're a little late.

689
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,180
We were supposed to work together

690
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:26,803
here at st. Dominic's remember?

691
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,703
- I took a holiday.

692
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:30,860
- Dance?

693
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,320
- Oh thanks but Father
Callahan and Angelo were

694
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,267
and I we were just--

695
00:33:34,267 --> 00:33:35,100
- I'm leaving.

696
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,090
- I've already left.

697
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,417
- Looks like your excuses
have run out on you.

698
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:45,033
(gentle music)

699
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:55,420
You're light on your feet.

700
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,140
Must be the road work I'm doing,

701
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,640
once around the reservoir every morning.

702
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,840
That accounts for endurance

703
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,720
but not for a sense of rhythm.

704
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,123
- Then it must be punching the bag.

705
00:34:04,123 --> 00:34:07,373
- But you're not dancing on your hands.

706
00:34:07,373 --> 00:34:08,550
- Well then it's skipping rope.

707
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,010
- Will you quit shadow boxing,

708
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,320
you're just naturally graceful

709
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,990
and don't be ashamed of it.

710
00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:16,580
It's much better than being awkward.

711
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,288
I can tell a born dancer, you coordinate.

712
00:34:19,288 --> 00:34:21,540
- Oh, that's what I do.

713
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:23,810
- And don't pretend you don't understand.

714
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:26,520
Father Callahan said you know
much longer words than you use

715
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,720
and you can pronounce
all of them correctly.

716
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,360
He also said you're a secret reader,

717
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,683
the way some people nip on the sly.

718
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:38,330
- Okay Miss Brooke's,
you got the goods on me.

719
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,223
I'll go quiet.

720
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:42,390
- I called you Paul.

721
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:45,560
- Then, to you I'll speak different.

722
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,143
(gentle music)

723
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:02,983
- Paul?

724
00:35:02,983 --> 00:35:03,850
- Yeah?

725
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,520
- Can I see you fight sometime?

726
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,773
- No ma'am, never.

727
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,373
You asked me, Emily, so I told ya.

728
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,960
- Well you didn't have to
answer with your left jab.

729
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,793
- I'm sorry

730
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,763
but if you saw me in the ring,

731
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,580
a girl like you wouldn't go
for that sort of business.

732
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,523
It's no good.

733
00:35:28,216 --> 00:35:31,320
(upbeat music)

734
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,720
You can do better than that.

735
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,290
(gentle music)

736
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,323
- That's right, you do enjoy good music.

737
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,490
- That Father Callaghan's
been talking again.

738
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:46,053
- It's no crime to enjoy fine music, Paul.

739
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:49,810
It's the key to a number
of good pleasures.

740
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:53,450
After that you enjoy
good books, good food,

741
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:58,450
good conversation, good
people, and good relationships.

742
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,393
- Like the ones I haven't known.

743
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,360
Emily, don't tell me
a pretty girl like you

744
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,020
doesn't have plenty of boyfriends.

745
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,110
- If you're trying to find out

746
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,520
if I've been sitting
around waiting for you

747
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,833
well, I'll have to admit I
do go out on other dates.

748
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,059
- You may get the chance
to see me fight yet.

749
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:29,642
(Emily laughs)

750
00:36:34,433 --> 00:36:37,016
(bell ringing)

751
00:36:45,357 --> 00:36:47,117
- [June] Hiya handsome.

752
00:36:47,117 --> 00:36:47,950
- Hi.

753
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,800
One roll to see if I win ya.

754
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,920
- [June] Didn't you know,

755
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,670
dice are always loaded in my favor.

756
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,373
- [Paul] Two pair.

757
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,390
- Three of a kind,

758
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,990
- [Paul] Guess, I don't
make the grade tonight.

759
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,170
- Not with this hand.

760
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,093
So long chap.

761
00:37:21,842 --> 00:37:24,425
(gentle music)

762
00:37:28,964 --> 00:37:32,797
(singing in foreign language)

763
00:37:48,185 --> 00:37:50,685
(door knocks)

764
00:38:01,283 --> 00:38:04,283
(upbeat jazz music)

765
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,970
- I told Angelo I was coming over.

766
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:09,670
- He mentioned it but never said when.

767
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,503
- Right now.

768
00:38:10,503 --> 00:38:12,200
Since we're alone I'll get
right down to the point.

769
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,003
Monk, I bring you good tidings.

770
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,580
The Mysteriosos Of Cauliflower Rally,

771
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,610
those slick, soft-spoken gentlemen

772
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,930
that they refer to as The Syndicate

773
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:23,763
are interested in ya.

774
00:38:23,763 --> 00:38:25,430
- What does that make me?

775
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,360
- Well makes ya a
candidate for big purses.

776
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,650
- How big?

777
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:29,810
- Depends on how well you draw

778
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:30,770
but you ought to draw well

779
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:33,670
because you're in for a
big publicity build-up.

780
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:36,120
Look monk you're gonna
fight main events in cities

781
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,020
where normally they use
club fighters like you

782
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,473
for curtain raisers and
pretty soon the garden.

783
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,410
So if you live sensibly, which you won't,

784
00:38:43,410 --> 00:38:45,730
and stay away from fascinating dames,

785
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,760
which you probably can't,

786
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,200
you'll have some money left to live on

787
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,633
after your punched silly.

788
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,580
- Where does this switch leave you?

789
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,540
- Me, oh I'm still your manager.

790
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,430
I take a smaller cut but
then it's a bigger pie

791
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,270
and fronting for The Syndicate

792
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,940
makes certain the pie is on the table.

793
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,960
- Mr. Hellman, I can see
you put up a big battle

794
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,223
before you hollered Mama.

795
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:10,080
- Monk, I leave the
heroics to my fighters.

796
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,210
They're better equipped for it.

797
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:14,220
I didn't come into this game
to go out with any medals.

798
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,753
I was attractive to the cash.

799
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,530
No reporter will ever quote me as saying

800
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,860
I did it for the good of the game

801
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,820
or because I enjoyed the companionship

802
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,523
of punch-drunk gargoyles.

803
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,910
- I'd like to take one good swing at you.

804
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:32,890
- Obviously, but you won't
change my way of thinking.

805
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:34,900
Monk, I'll tell you something.

806
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,097
I may be selfish but I'm honest

807
00:39:36,097 --> 00:39:38,600
and I call all the cards
even when they're marked.

808
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,730
- I don't like you.

809
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,360
I don't understand you.

810
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,060
- Keep it that way, you'll be better off.

811
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:44,893
- Okay.

812
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:48,080
What do we do about this syndicate?

813
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:48,913
- We see them.

814
00:39:48,913 --> 00:39:49,746
- When?

815
00:39:49,746 --> 00:39:50,579
- Right now.

816
00:39:58,253 --> 00:40:01,000
And Monk, one word of advice

817
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,630
don't act conceited with these gentlemen.

818
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,343
They don't want you because
you're a great fighter.

819
00:40:05,343 --> 00:40:06,960
- Then why tag me?

820
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,040
- I told you they're smart.

821
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,650
They, they balance the
fighters they control.

822
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:13,190
They never match similar
boys, that would be boring.

823
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,800
Public wants variety.

824
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,530
The clever counter-puncher
against the slugger,

825
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:19,610
the Hell's Kitchen lowbrow
against the college waltzer,

826
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:23,300
variety, dream pussies, angel faces,

827
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,040
gentleman boxers, killers.

828
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,805
- What am I supposed to be?

829
00:40:27,805 --> 00:40:29,140
- (clears throat) Well they didn't tell me

830
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,940
but I understand what they
need is a real dirty fighter.

831
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,050
- How'd you get that?

832
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:58,440
I was fighting Pretty
Boy Jones in New Haven.

833
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,170
- He wasn't pretty when
they carried him out.

834
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:03,190
- Oh, give me the lowdown, how?

835
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:05,050
- Well Monk, before we tag anyone

836
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,770
we have the boy watched carefully.

837
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:08,310
You were scouted

838
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:11,150
and one of our men took these
pictures with a hidden camera.

839
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:14,090
We've had them blowing up and
slowed down for your benefit.

840
00:41:14,090 --> 00:41:15,070
- You saw the winner.

841
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,830
- I sure did.

842
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:19,220
- Don't forget him Monk Baroni,

843
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,030
that's the fighter we buy

844
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:24,267
and from here in that's
the way you fight .

845
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:32,413
- Hey Monk, Monk come
here a minute will ya?

846
00:41:39,213 --> 00:41:41,530
You're fighting Sailor
Jetson in Newark next week.

847
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:42,363
- How does he look?

848
00:41:42,363 --> 00:41:43,196
- Hot.

849
00:41:43,196 --> 00:41:44,750
You know, that's a funny
thing you never ask me

850
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,020
can he punch, is he
fast, what's his reach,

851
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,440
is he strong, it's
always how does he look?

852
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,670
- That's all I'm interested in.

853
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,097
- Well I'll tell ya, the,

854
00:41:53,097 --> 00:41:56,550
the Sailor's a good-looking,
clean-cut, blond boy.

855
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,443
- I'll fix that.

856
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,700
- You hate every man you fight, don't ya?

857
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:03,203
- Just evening up a score, that's all.

858
00:42:04,206 --> 00:42:07,623
(punching bags slapping)

859
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,890
- Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the main event.

860
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:18,890
In the black corner,
wearing purple trunks,

861
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:23,523
weighing in at 167 pounds, Monk Baroni.

862
00:42:23,523 --> 00:42:25,922
(crowd booing)

863
00:42:25,922 --> 00:42:27,560
(bell ringing)

864
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:31,020
And here in the white
corner, wearing gold trunks,

865
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:35,102
and 170 pounds, Sailor Jetson.

866
00:42:35,102 --> 00:42:37,685
(crowd cheers)

867
00:42:41,654 --> 00:42:42,780
- Now you boys both know the rules

868
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,440
laid down by the Athletic Commission.

869
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,110
I want a nice clean fight

870
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,180
and if a fighter gets knocked down

871
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,380
I want the other fighter to go to

872
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,840
the farthest neutral corner.

873
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,683
Now shake hands and come out fighting.

874
00:42:52,544 --> 00:42:53,419
(crowd shouting)

875
00:42:53,419 --> 00:42:55,360
(whistle blowing)

876
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,057
(bell dings)

877
00:42:57,057 --> 00:42:59,807
(crowd shouting)

878
00:43:04,818 --> 00:43:07,568
(powerful music)

879
00:43:11,974 --> 00:43:14,974
(triumphant music)

880
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:26,642
(gentle music)

881
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,743
- How was this trip, Paul?

882
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:36,320
- Just one fight after another.

883
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:38,523
You want the sum total?

884
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:42,853
30 stitches, one busted
knuckle, two lose teeth,

885
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:48,540
maybe half a pint of blood, money too.

886
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:49,593
Angelo banks it.

887
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:54,130
By the time I look like a real
ape, I'll have a bank roll.

888
00:43:57,530 --> 00:44:01,050
I don't know if my buildup
is good but it sure is fast.

889
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:03,650
Fans are paying more and
more to see me get slugged.

890
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:08,030
- Hurt much?

891
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:09,033
- Sure it hurts.

892
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,913
That's my job, to get hurt.

893
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:15,193
People pay good money to see me get hurt,

894
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,083
maybe get killed.

895
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,853
Don't feel sorry for me, Emily.

896
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,100
I like this plaster, the
patches, and the cuts.

897
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:25,563
They help hide my face.

898
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:30,653
Yeah, on me it looks good.

899
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,129
I'm glad I can wear 'em
when I have to meet you.

900
00:44:36,129 --> 00:44:38,712
(gentle music)

901
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:46,800
- You don't have to wear
a mask with me, Paul.

902
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,683
- I know but it makes it easier.

903
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,600
- You hate what you're doing?

904
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,433
- I do.

905
00:44:57,670 --> 00:45:00,110
It's not even fighting,
it's throwing a gorilla

906
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:02,163
into the ring to put on a slaughter fest.

907
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:08,023
- But you really want to be a fighter?

908
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,573
- What else could I do with this?

909
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,503
- You could change your face.

910
00:45:20,913 --> 00:45:22,351
- What?

911
00:45:22,351 --> 00:45:25,940
- Yes, since it's your
face that stands between

912
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:28,533
you and yourself, your
real self, change it.

913
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:31,060
- How?

914
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:31,893
- Plastic surgery.

915
00:45:31,893 --> 00:45:34,610
Think of the miracles they
did during the war, Paul,

916
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:36,260
your face would be easy for them.

917
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:40,470
- But if I, if I change my face
I have to give up fighting.

918
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:42,810
- You'll be giving up what you hate.

919
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:45,366
- But I've come quite a
ways in the boxing game.

920
00:45:45,366 --> 00:45:46,963
- You still despise it.

921
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:52,051
- It's money, when you never
had it before in your life

922
00:45:52,051 --> 00:45:53,883
you just don't go tossing it over.

923
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,510
- But what good is it
when you're miserable,

924
00:45:58,510 --> 00:45:59,643
hating and bitter.

925
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:05,060
You know Paul, you blame every
misfortune you've ever had

926
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,190
on just one thing.

927
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:08,660
- But that one thing is now
starting to pay off for me.

928
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,560
- But in what way?

929
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,470
- Sure you're living better.

930
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:15,560
But, but that anger and
resentment is still there,

931
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,973
maybe even more so.

932
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:20,360
- How will I make a living?

933
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:25,990
- We'll work that out.

934
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,510
- We?

935
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:31,113
- Yes we, you and me.

936
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,383
Paul when you discard that mask

937
00:46:34,383 --> 00:46:38,086
you'll, you'll finally be
at peace with yourself.

938
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:40,987
Then the world will see
the real, wonderful Paul.

939
00:46:40,987 --> 00:46:43,570
(gentle music)

940
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:53,700
- You tell me what to do.

941
00:47:02,449 --> 00:47:05,116
(playful music)

942
00:47:07,164 --> 00:47:08,625
- [Angelo] Hiya, Pete.

943
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:12,625
- Well this certainly is
an unexpected pleasure.

944
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:15,320
- [Pete] Here Monk.

945
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:21,053
- Thanks Pete but the
operation was a success.

946
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:23,460
This is a funeral wreath.

947
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:27,880
- I know but when I was shopping around,

948
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,263
that's all I could find.

949
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:39,363
- Uh, thanks again Pete but
you shouldn't have done it.

950
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:42,940
Say Father, have you seen Emily?

951
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:46,060
- I certainly have and I'm very
glad to hear about you too.

952
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,860
She's a fine girl.

953
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:50,200
Her family, they live in Buffalo.

954
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,290
They wrote to me inquiring about you.

955
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:54,640
I'm afraid I simply had
to tell them the truth.

956
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,710
After all, if it wasn't for me

957
00:47:57,710 --> 00:47:59,180
you'd have never known
the difference between

958
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:02,760
a right hook and a left jab. (laughs)

959
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:03,593
One thing about Emily--

960
00:48:03,593 --> 00:48:07,640
- I guess you guys have a lot
to talk over, I'm shoving.

961
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,620
- Thanks for everything Pete.

962
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,630
- It certainly was considered
of you to take time off

963
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:13,280
and come up and see an old buddy.

964
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:15,320
- So long, Pete.

965
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,360
- Bye.

966
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,900
(playful music)

967
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,820
- I guess I better be running along too.

968
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:21,940
- How's the gym coming?

969
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,040
- Fine more kids coming in every day.

970
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:29,040
- Say Father, in my condition
I can't handle any candy.

971
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:31,980
Why don't you take the box
of chocolates along with you,

972
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,320
for the gang at the church.

973
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:34,300
- [Father] Why it's a good idea.

974
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,799
I'm sure they'd appreciate.

975
00:48:35,799 --> 00:48:38,466
(playful music)

976
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:42,222
(all laughing)

977
00:48:50,451 --> 00:48:52,232
- [Paul] Hi.

978
00:48:52,232 --> 00:48:53,363
- Hiya handsome.

979
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:59,247
Hey who punched you pretty?

980
00:48:59,247 --> 00:49:00,123
- You like?

981
00:49:00,966 --> 00:49:05,470
- Mm-hmm, whoever did
it sure had the touch.

982
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:06,483
- No beef from me.

983
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,560
One roll to see if I win ya.

984
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,487
- I'm tough to beat it

985
00:49:11,487 --> 00:49:13,940
but it doesn't mean I'm invincible.

986
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:19,479
- Invincible, now what does that mean?

987
00:49:19,479 --> 00:49:22,062
(sultry music)

988
00:49:24,807 --> 00:49:26,097
- You just found out.

989
00:49:29,663 --> 00:49:32,687
- Now what would I do
with a fistful of cigars?

990
00:49:32,687 --> 00:49:35,071
- What else would you like?

991
00:49:35,071 --> 00:49:36,321
A box of candy?

992
00:49:38,271 --> 00:49:40,521
A package of playing cards?

993
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:43,979
A ballpen?

994
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:50,801
Well tell me, what else would you like?

995
00:49:57,558 --> 00:50:00,391
(energetic music)

996
00:50:22,123 --> 00:50:24,910
You're a swell dancer, you're graceful.

997
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:25,890
- Why not?

998
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:29,090
The roadwork I do, punching
the bag, skipping rope,

999
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:31,100
all that makes me light on my feet.

1000
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,700
- No kidding, good looking.

1001
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,130
You dance as if you're in another world.

1002
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:36,703
- Maybe that's it.

1003
00:50:36,703 --> 00:50:39,536
(energetic music)

1004
00:50:46,553 --> 00:50:49,363
- Here it is, I guess I can let myself in.

1005
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:52,780
I said myself.

1006
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,533
- Can't I smoke a last cigarette?

1007
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,210
- Okay the rubber mat says welcome

1008
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:00,723
but don't let it fool you.

1009
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,313
- Say this is all right.

1010
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:27,793
Light it.

1011
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,100
- You really want service.

1012
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,063
- Maybe I rate it.

1013
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,013
- Monk, let's get one thing straight.

1014
00:51:39,870 --> 00:51:41,780
Every Joe that buys a cigar from me

1015
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:43,010
or rattles the dice in the cup

1016
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:44,870
thinks the date goes with it.

1017
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:46,023
- Well, I don't.

1018
00:51:46,023 --> 00:51:49,830
Took me a long time and a new face.

1019
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:51,570
- So I went out with you.

1020
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:53,770
The date ends on the
other side of the door.

1021
00:51:56,001 --> 00:51:57,520
- I don't feel like leaving.

1022
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:01,560
- Please I'm a working
girl, I need sleep, rest,

1023
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:06,331
to hold my job, to make it pay
off I have to be attractive.

1024
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:09,487
- You mean all this and
the clothes you wear,

1025
00:52:09,487 --> 00:52:11,670
you win all that across the counter.

1026
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,230
- I can't stop some of my dates

1027
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:15,283
from buying me small presents.

1028
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,820
Like that off-the-shoulder gown

1029
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:19,970
we saw tonight in Bergdorf's window.

1030
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,033
- You got it baby.

1031
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:25,433
- I guess maybe you can
smoke that last cigarette.

1032
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:32,733
(traffic humming)

1033
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,610
- Angelo, get down to the bank

1034
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:51,960
and bring back some scratch, huh?

1035
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,893
- Like how much?

1036
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,223
- Two or three C's.

1037
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:58,980
- I don't think you've got that much.

1038
00:53:00,194 --> 00:53:01,447
- What do you mean?

1039
00:53:01,447 --> 00:53:03,020
- The way you've been
throwing your dough around

1040
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,177
you're nearly all tapped out.

1041
00:53:04,177 --> 00:53:06,273
- (scoffs) You're crazy.

1042
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,500
- Since you've been
hanging around with June,

1043
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,413
here's the tab.

1044
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,870
One evening gown, 250, one stole 600,

1045
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:19,950
half a dozen pair of shoesies, 180,

1046
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:23,563
assorted costume jewelry,
200, sundry items 580.

1047
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:27,190
Everything's going out,
nothing's coming in.

1048
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:30,210
Everything for June, nothing
for Emily, not even time.

1049
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:31,560
- Why don't you mind your own business.

1050
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:35,920
- Okay, okay.

1051
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:36,970
- Where ya going now?

1052
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:40,680
- I'm gonna take five bucks to your mom

1053
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,453
and then I'm gonna go look for a job.

1054
00:53:49,681 --> 00:53:52,840
(gentle music)

1055
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:54,360
- You haven't said much.

1056
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,360
- I've been watching you watch yourself.

1057
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,490
I guess the mirror no longer scares you.

1058
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:01,323
- Not a bit.

1059
00:54:01,323 --> 00:54:03,710
- In fact, it fascinates
you, like hypnotism.

1060
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:05,640
- Can't a guy look at himself?

1061
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,443
- Not long enough to pass
out into a dream world.

1062
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,870
What's come over you, Paul?

1063
00:54:11,870 --> 00:54:13,894
It's been three weeks since I've seen you

1064
00:54:13,894 --> 00:54:16,394
and when you do show up,
you're late, you're rude.

1065
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,280
I like the old Paul better.

1066
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,120
- Well I don't.

1067
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,313
- You proved you don't.

1068
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:25,933
We were supposed to make
plans, talk about our future.

1069
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:29,510
- Give me a little time, Emily.

1070
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:31,070
I'll get over this.

1071
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:32,270
- I don't think so Paul.

1072
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,870
I watched you in the hotel lobby,

1073
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:37,533
on the street when we
walked, in the restaurant,

1074
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:41,170
you've got no thoughts
for anyone but yourself

1075
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:44,920
and the way you beg for
admiration from the girls.

1076
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,030
- Well I never had any.

1077
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:48,823
- Well from what I hear you're
making up for lost time.

1078
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,360
- Emily nothing has changed between us.

1079
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:54,480
- I don't know.

1080
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,780
Well I'll prove it to you.

1081
00:54:58,672 --> 00:54:59,713
- Paul.

1082
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,588
- You still think I look like a.

1083
00:55:02,588 --> 00:55:04,421
- Paul, how could you?

1084
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:07,569
Do you think this new face matters to me?

1085
00:55:07,569 --> 00:55:09,894
- Well you act like it.

1086
00:55:09,894 --> 00:55:12,285
- I don't like you.

1087
00:55:12,285 --> 00:55:13,118
I don't understand you.

1088
00:55:13,118 --> 00:55:15,440
- Because I'm like any
other guy with his girl.

1089
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:20,854
- Leave me alone.

1090
00:55:20,854 --> 00:55:23,937
(suspenseful music)

1091
00:55:25,150 --> 00:55:25,983
- Emily!

1092
00:55:29,849 --> 00:55:32,432
(sultry music)

1093
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:09,773
- No, Monk.

1094
00:56:09,773 --> 00:56:11,360
- Can't I smoke a last cigarette?

1095
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,317
- I told you I want to go to sleep.

1096
00:56:13,317 --> 00:56:14,920
- Came over you all of a sudden, huh?

1097
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,470
- Look Monk, I don't
care for hallway scenes

1098
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:18,940
so I'll make this short.

1099
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:21,666
Let's say goodnight and goodbye.

1100
00:56:21,666 --> 00:56:23,050
- Why?

1101
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:24,720
- You're in way over your head,

1102
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,110
you can't afford to go out with me.

1103
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:28,690
I like nice things

1104
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:30,320
but I don't want them
out of your eating, Monk.

1105
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,350
- I can get more.

1106
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:33,110
- I want no part of trouble.

1107
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:35,230
Why you even owe the
hotel last month's rent.

1108
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:36,530
- Ah, that's nothing.

1109
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:39,450
- Look Buster, I'm not your bookkeeper.

1110
00:56:39,450 --> 00:56:42,800
All I'm trying to tell ya
is that this round's over.

1111
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,790
We had some fun, I let
you break in your new face

1112
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:46,723
and this is it.

1113
00:56:46,723 --> 00:56:48,670
- So it's a brush, huh?

1114
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:52,930
- To go out with you,
just doesn't make sense

1115
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:55,723
and if anything, I'm a sensible girl.

1116
00:56:58,764 --> 00:57:00,943
- You might as well take
in your welcome mat.

1117
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:15,432
(traffic humming)

1118
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:29,760
What do you want here?

1119
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,357
- I was worried about you.

1120
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:36,770
- You ran out on me
once, leave it that way.

1121
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:39,953
- Paul, I want to talk to you.

1122
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:42,273
I may be going away.

1123
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:45,223
- This is no place to talk.

1124
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:51,210
Besides there's nothing to say.

1125
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:52,970
- Emily's going away to teach.

1126
00:57:52,970 --> 00:57:54,530
- Fine pal.

1127
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:56,750
All you think of is ways to trip me up.

1128
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:58,670
Why don't you just butt
out of my business?

1129
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:01,740
- Don't pick on Angelo, I
asked him to bring me here.

1130
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,850
- Sure and he was glad to,

1131
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:06,570
anything to prove I'm a no-good guy.

1132
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:09,097
You're all right people,
now that I'm broke.

1133
00:58:09,097 --> 00:58:11,190
- You know that doesn't matter to me.

1134
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:13,870
We talked about it just
before your operation.

1135
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:16,253
We were supposed to plan
our future together.

1136
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:21,791
You, you promised we'd work it out.

1137
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:23,580
- Well it worked out fine.

1138
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:26,040
I got a new face, no
friends, and I'm broke.

1139
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,463
- Don't pip Emily, she
didn't blow your bank roll.

1140
00:58:27,463 --> 00:58:29,523
- I told you to butt out of this.

1141
00:58:32,064 --> 00:58:34,043
Get out, get out both of ya.

1142
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:35,913
I don't want to be needled, get out!

1143
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,260
- I'll take you home.

1144
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,093
- Goodbye, Paul.

1145
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:55,010
- Say, where's the clerk?

1146
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:57,713
- You're out of bounds brother,
this isn't the Waldorf.

1147
00:58:58,670 --> 00:59:01,710
You don't happen to know
a Monk Baroni, do you?

1148
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:04,130
- I did know a Monk Baroni.

1149
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:05,504
- Know where I could find him?

1150
00:59:05,504 --> 00:59:06,700
- You're too far Uptown.

1151
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:07,630
Why don't you try one of those

1152
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:09,782
flea traps on the West Side of the tracks?

1153
00:59:09,782 --> 00:59:13,282
- [Mr. Hellman] All right, I will, thanks.

1154
00:59:18,443 --> 00:59:20,943
(door knocks)

1155
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:27,723
Hello, Monk.

1156
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:29,563
- How did you find me?

1157
00:59:29,563 --> 00:59:32,710
That was easy, I just followed
a trail of unpaid bills

1158
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:34,870
and those fascinating dame's
that I was telling you about

1159
00:59:34,870 --> 00:59:36,163
have begun to crush up.

1160
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,590
- What do you want?

1161
00:59:38,590 --> 00:59:39,900
- Look you've been avoiding me, what for?

1162
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,770
I know it isn't your conscience.

1163
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:43,713
- I don't want to see anybody.

1164
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:45,293
- Well I wanna see you.

1165
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:49,960
Well, well that's pretty.

1166
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,103
- Save the cracks.

1167
00:59:51,995 --> 00:59:54,180
I had a little accident,

1168
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:55,310
that's why you didn't hear from me.

1169
00:59:55,310 --> 00:59:58,470
When the medic patched me
up, he made a few changes.

1170
00:59:58,470 --> 00:59:59,760
- Few changes, huh,

1171
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,400
I'd say that was the
understatement of the season.

1172
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,600
- Well I vote for it.

1173
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:04,260
- I don't, Monk, for me
the old face was better,

1174
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,500
certainly a lot better for fighting.

1175
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,620
- Maybe I ain't fighting anymore.

1176
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:08,453
- Why give up the ring

1177
01:00:08,453 --> 01:00:10,320
just when you're ready for the big purses?

1178
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,640
Monk when that doctor fixed your face

1179
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,120
he certainly didn't help your brain much.

1180
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,210
- I'm giving it up, I'm gonna retire.

1181
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:16,043
- Retire on what?

1182
01:00:16,043 --> 01:00:17,610
Your clippings?

1183
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:20,110
But Monk, you're just
hurting yourself, not us.

1184
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:21,160
The cab loses a fender,

1185
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,899
the taxi company doesn't go
out of business, does it?

1186
01:00:23,899 --> 01:00:26,070
And for me and my associates,
fighting his business,

1187
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:27,680
business, it goes on and on.

1188
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,003
- so I quit.

1189
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:33,590
- No fighter ever quits, Monk.

1190
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:34,910
Once you lace on a pair of those gloves

1191
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:36,360
you make a lifelong marriage.

1192
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,680
You never get away from it.

1193
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,330
When you leave the stadium
at night after a fight

1194
01:00:40,330 --> 01:00:42,700
who sells you the morning papers?

1195
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:44,193
A blind ex-pug.

1196
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,160
You'll never get away from it

1197
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:48,840
and your broken now, Monk.

1198
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,260
So I know you'll come running back to me.

1199
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:51,793
My advice is to make it soon.

1200
01:00:55,170 --> 01:00:57,793
My associates haven't
got too much patience.

1201
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,723
They may find themselves
another dirty fighter.

1202
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:12,240
- [Trainer] Come on champ.

1203
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:29,660
- All right Monk, let's
make it short and sweet.

1204
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:31,364
Remember this is your
first come back fight

1205
01:01:31,364 --> 01:01:33,990
and those sports writers out
there want plenty action.

1206
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:34,920
Give it to them.

1207
01:01:38,063 --> 01:01:39,813
- Semi Windup's on, you're next.

1208
01:01:47,631 --> 01:01:49,876
(audience chattering)

1209
01:01:49,876 --> 01:01:52,876
(audience cheering)

1210
01:02:04,733 --> 01:02:07,566
(audience booing)

1211
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:12,479
- [Audience Member] Come on, Monk!

1212
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,729
- All right, let's go boys.

1213
01:02:16,275 --> 01:02:17,410
Now you boys know the rules.

1214
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:18,470
I want a nice clean fight.

1215
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:20,260
Keep all your punches in fair territory

1216
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:21,390
and break clean when I tell you.

1217
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:23,563
Shake hands now and come
out fighting at the bell.

1218
01:02:24,718 --> 01:02:27,327
(buzzer dings)

1219
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,601
(bell dings)

1220
01:02:28,601 --> 01:02:31,601
(audience shouting)

1221
01:02:44,636 --> 01:02:47,553
(audience booing)

1222
01:03:03,158 --> 01:03:04,070
- What's come over Monk?

1223
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:06,580
- Don't know, he acts like
he's been reading Emily Post.

1224
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:09,653
- Well he better drop his
pinky in the next round.

1225
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:12,653
(audience shouting)

1226
01:03:16,273 --> 01:03:17,617
- I'll whisper in his
ear that this is a fight

1227
01:03:17,617 --> 01:03:19,050
and not a cotillion.

1228
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:21,864
- Yeah, tell him we put
a bet on a knockout.

1229
01:03:21,864 --> 01:03:23,846
(audience shouting)

1230
01:03:23,846 --> 01:03:26,447
(bell dings)

1231
01:03:26,447 --> 01:03:29,450
(audience booing)

1232
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:31,020
- Thought he was easy to hit?

1233
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:33,210
- Always was, looks like
he switched his style.

1234
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:34,043
- Sure did.

1235
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:35,330
- So box him.

1236
01:03:35,330 --> 01:03:37,910
If we both box, where's the action?

1237
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:39,957
- You want a little
softer music this round?

1238
01:03:39,957 --> 01:03:42,673
All right you proved you
can dance, now fight.

1239
01:03:42,673 --> 01:03:45,906
(buzzer dings)

1240
01:03:45,906 --> 01:03:47,230
(bell rings)

1241
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:48,474
- [Audience Member] Hey get him!

1242
01:03:48,474 --> 01:03:50,204
Come on, Monk.

1243
01:03:50,204 --> 01:03:52,400
Come on, fight, fight!

1244
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:55,400
(audience shouting)

1245
01:04:01,669 --> 01:04:03,694
(audience booing)

1246
01:04:03,694 --> 01:04:04,777
Come on Monk!

1247
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:09,078
- Come on, punch a little bit,

1248
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:11,178
use the match, will ya?

1249
01:04:11,178 --> 01:04:14,011
(audience booing)

1250
01:04:15,137 --> 01:04:16,804
- Come on!
- Come on!

1251
01:04:19,087 --> 01:04:20,384
- Come on, fight.

1252
01:04:20,384 --> 01:04:23,384
(audience shouting)

1253
01:04:25,657 --> 01:04:27,124
(bell dings)

1254
01:04:27,124 --> 01:04:29,957
(audience booing)

1255
01:04:31,278 --> 01:04:33,292
(bell ringing)

1256
01:04:33,292 --> 01:04:37,209
- The winner by unanimous
decision, Art Chafee.

1257
01:04:38,707 --> 01:04:41,540
(audience booing)

1258
01:04:49,783 --> 01:04:51,650
- What kind of a double-cross is this?

1259
01:04:51,650 --> 01:04:52,640
Let's start out with a tiger

1260
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:54,370
and wind up with a pussycat.

1261
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:56,140
- From here on in, that's
the way I'm fighting.

1262
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:58,680
- Oh no it's not, not
for us or anybody else.

1263
01:04:58,680 --> 01:04:59,940
I don't need you to play pattycake.

1264
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:00,980
If I want this kind of a battle

1265
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:03,663
I can get a better one right
out of an old maid's home.

1266
01:05:05,463 --> 01:05:08,046
(gentle music)

1267
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:18,713
- Angelo.

1268
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,273
Let me lug this.

1269
01:05:22,898 --> 01:05:25,050
I watched you go the distance tonight.

1270
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:25,883
The way you fought,

1271
01:05:25,883 --> 01:05:28,330
you ain't strong enough
to carry this gear.

1272
01:05:28,330 --> 01:05:29,410
- I keep my face

1273
01:05:30,311 --> 01:05:32,650
and the crowd gets their
money's worth booing me.

1274
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:33,950
- Your face looks alright.

1275
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:36,590
Maybe a little on the sad side.

1276
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,720
- Have you seen Emily?

1277
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,963
- Like I told you, she left town to teach.

1278
01:05:43,345 --> 01:05:44,178
- Have you seen Father Callahan?

1279
01:05:44,178 --> 01:05:45,990
- He don't ask me about you.

1280
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:48,463
What I could tell him he
reads in the sports column.

1281
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:55,000
- Come on, Angelo, we split a steak,

1282
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,350
then we split a pool table.

1283
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:00,590
- [Hal] I say get rid of him.

1284
01:06:00,590 --> 01:06:03,310
We lost 10 G's on him last night.

1285
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:04,300
- My advice is to wait,

1286
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:06,680
this boy's in love with his new face.

1287
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,947
- Then cut it up, 10
G's worth and dump him.

1288
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:11,495
- I still say wait.

1289
01:06:11,495 --> 01:06:13,240
- [Hal] For what?

1290
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,380
- For a killing, that's for what.

1291
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:16,820
- What are you driving at?

1292
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:18,940
This kid wants to be a
cover boy, not a champ.

1293
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:21,190
- Now you got him pegged
wrong, he's good for a killing.

1294
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:22,400
- When?

1295
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,890
- Look, let him fight four or five times

1296
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:26,350
as a defensive boxer.

1297
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:27,360
He'll lose every body,

1298
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:28,920
he'll be outboxed, out-classed,

1299
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:31,120
but he'll go from an odds-on
favorite to a longshot.

1300
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:33,260
The odds will get better
and better for us.

1301
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:34,830
- If there's a payoff.

1302
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:36,060
- There will be, once he goes back

1303
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:38,060
to his old style of fighting.

1304
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:39,590
Why one big bop with him as a killer,

1305
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:41,320
we're bound to clean up.

1306
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:44,343
- Say that's not bad, not bad at all.

1307
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:48,360
How you gonna make him fight
his old way, even once?

1308
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:49,910
- I'll find a way.

1309
01:06:49,910 --> 01:06:52,140
- Well we'll ride with you

1310
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:55,140
but you're carrying the load from here in.

1311
01:06:56,060 --> 01:06:57,138
- I'll handle it.

1312
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:58,588
- There'd better be a payoff.

1313
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:08,730
- Okay teacher you don't
have to draw us a diagram,

1314
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:10,640
we take your word for it,

1315
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,603
but just to keep it friendly
you're gonna chip in with us.

1316
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,210
Doug and I are putting
up ten grand a piece

1317
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:19,430
and you're gonna put up five grand.

1318
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:21,030
- Me, 5000?

1319
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:21,863
- Why not?

1320
01:07:21,863 --> 01:07:23,520
If you're really sold on this operation

1321
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:24,460
you can scrape it up.

1322
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:27,120
- With monk going into that
fight at odds of seven to two

1323
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:29,170
you shouldn't even stop to think it over.

1324
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,950
- All right, count me in.

1325
01:07:32,950 --> 01:07:35,470
- Let me tell you one thing teacher,

1326
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:36,620
if something goes wrong

1327
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,620
better buy yourself a new blackboard.

1328
01:07:56,149 --> 01:07:58,732
(gentle music)

1329
01:08:16,549 --> 01:08:18,590
- Why did you have me meet you here?

1330
01:08:18,590 --> 01:08:20,010
- I wanted you to see with your own eyes

1331
01:08:20,010 --> 01:08:21,210
what their striving for.

1332
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:22,903
They've got big plans,

1333
01:08:22,903 --> 01:08:26,810
like plans to help every
kid in this neighborhood.

1334
01:08:26,810 --> 01:08:28,650
- Okay I'll chip in

1335
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:31,970
but I don't want to run
in to Father Callahan.

1336
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:33,130
- You won't.

1337
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:34,680
He's out trying to raise money.

1338
01:08:35,790 --> 01:08:36,713
And so is Emily.

1339
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:41,320
- Who told you about Emily?

1340
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:42,580
- Monk, for what I'm gonna ask you to do

1341
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:44,913
I had to know everything
about ya, everything.

1342
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:47,510
- What do you want?

1343
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:58,140
- Monk, you've heard me
pop off about big shots

1344
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:00,758
and heroes before, you
know they don't impress me.

1345
01:09:00,758 --> 01:09:03,400
So what I'm tell you
must come from my heart.

1346
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,570
Believe me, Monk, you've got
a chance to be a big man now,

1347
01:09:05,570 --> 01:09:07,050
big where it counts,

1348
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:09,313
big in the eyes of Father
Callahan and Emily.

1349
01:09:11,186 --> 01:09:12,940
- What do I have to do?

1350
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,170
- Give 'em that recreation hall

1351
01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:15,900
they're campaigning so hard for.

1352
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:17,100
They've got their heart set on it

1353
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:17,933
but they'll never get it

1354
01:09:17,933 --> 01:09:20,420
from pennies, and nickels, and dimes.

1355
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:23,370
You can give it to them
on a silver platter.

1356
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:24,740
- How?

1357
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:29,170
- By fighting the Seattle
Wildcat the way I tell ya.

1358
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:31,448
- You know how I've been fighting.

1359
01:09:31,448 --> 01:09:33,220
- Yeah I know, but that's got to change.

1360
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:35,010
Look, win this fight and
the whole purse goes to

1361
01:09:35,010 --> 01:09:36,363
St. Dominic's, our end too.

1362
01:09:37,366 --> 01:09:38,366
This is a fair deal.

1363
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:42,173
I wouldn't lie to you,
you know that, not here.

1364
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:45,950
You fight and I manage,
this is for a good cause.

1365
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,987
- Where do you and the syndicate come in?

1366
01:09:49,987 --> 01:09:52,290
- The odds you'll be fighting at,

1367
01:09:52,290 --> 01:09:53,990
we'll do very well with side bets.

1368
01:09:58,139 --> 01:10:00,360
- You really think this will square me?

1369
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,180
With Father Callahan and with Emily?

1370
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:03,830
- I know it will.

1371
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:06,080
Why this is bigger than penances,

1372
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:08,070
it's even bigger than lip service.

1373
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:10,670
You're saying you're sorry
the only way that counts.

1374
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:14,030
I'll vouch for it Monk.

1375
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:15,000
You fight my way

1376
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,250
and you'll be okay with
the Father and Emily.

1377
01:10:19,319 --> 01:10:20,319
Now what do you say?

1378
01:10:25,979 --> 01:10:29,146
(audience chattering)

1379
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:32,080
- Sure everything is okay?

1380
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,430
We got the money spread out.

1381
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:35,263
- Yes I'm sure,

1382
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:37,053
besides you've got me for a deposit.

1383
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:40,520
- Maybe you ought to give
him some final instructions.

1384
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:43,170
- No the kid hates me,
I'd just irritate him.

1385
01:10:43,170 --> 01:10:44,863
Anyhow Angelo handles him better.

1386
01:10:46,930 --> 01:10:47,980
(door knocks)

1387
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:49,480
- [Gym Worker] You're up next.

1388
01:11:04,814 --> 01:11:06,655
(audience shouting)

1389
01:11:06,655 --> 01:11:08,738
- [Audience Members] Boo.

1390
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:17,073
- [Audience Member] Knock him out!

1391
01:11:23,244 --> 01:11:25,144
- He never wanted me to see him fight.

1392
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:28,867
- You didn't come here
just as an onlooker.

1393
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:31,079
You're here to help him with your thoughts

1394
01:11:31,079 --> 01:11:32,496
and your prayers.

1395
01:11:35,623 --> 01:11:37,180
- [Audience Member] Oh, here he comes.

1396
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:40,978
(audience applauding)

1397
01:11:40,978 --> 01:11:43,978
(audience shouting)

1398
01:11:47,601 --> 01:11:50,184
(bell ringing)

1399
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:55,450
- This is the main event of the evening.

1400
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:57,353
10 rounds of boxing.

1401
01:11:58,450 --> 01:12:02,420
In this corner at 164 and a half pounds,

1402
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:04,842
Kid Monk Baroni.

1403
01:12:04,842 --> 01:12:07,940
(audience booing)

1404
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:10,773
And in this corner, at 165 pounds,

1405
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:14,361
the Seattle Wildcat.

1406
01:12:14,361 --> 01:12:17,998
(audience cheering)

1407
01:12:17,998 --> 01:12:20,650
The referee Jack Stony

1408
01:12:20,650 --> 01:12:22,692
and may the best man win.

1409
01:12:22,692 --> 01:12:25,525
(audience booing)

1410
01:12:26,374 --> 01:12:27,390
- I want a good, clean fight.

1411
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:28,460
Keep your punches up.

1412
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:30,360
Now shake hands and come out fighting.

1413
01:12:33,811 --> 01:12:34,968
(buzzer dinging)

1414
01:12:34,968 --> 01:12:37,942
- [Audience Member] Come on boys.

1415
01:12:37,942 --> 01:12:40,173
(bell ringing)

1416
01:12:40,173 --> 01:12:43,173
(audience shouting)

1417
01:12:57,541 --> 01:12:59,957
- Get him, Monk, get him!

1418
01:12:59,957 --> 01:13:02,957
(audience shouting)

1419
01:13:17,399 --> 01:13:19,982
(bell ringing)

1420
01:13:24,215 --> 01:13:27,654
- [Audience Member] Come on, Monk!

1421
01:13:27,654 --> 01:13:29,090
- He's coerced tonight.

1422
01:13:29,090 --> 01:13:30,790
- You wear him down, I'll tell ya.

1423
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:32,250
He can't take it anymore.

1424
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:34,890
- He hits like a bull.

1425
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:37,220
- Yeah but every time
you nick him in the puss,

1426
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:38,450
he's hurt double.

1427
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:39,903
Keep after his face.

1428
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:47,470
(bell dings)

1429
01:13:47,470 --> 01:13:50,470
(audience shouting)

1430
01:14:10,569 --> 01:14:12,749
- [Audience Member] Come on, Monk.

1431
01:14:12,749 --> 01:14:15,749
(audience shouting)

1432
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:32,327
(bell ringing)

1433
01:14:32,327 --> 01:14:35,327
(audience cheering)

1434
01:14:38,205 --> 01:14:39,280
- He's certainly taking a beating.

1435
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,234
- Yeah and so are we.

1436
01:14:41,234 --> 01:14:43,830
If he doesn't come up with a
Sunday punch, we lose 20 G's.

1437
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:45,140
- He will.

1438
01:14:45,140 --> 01:14:46,180
You don't know how much that kid

1439
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:47,550
wants to spare himself,
(buzzer dinging)

1440
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:49,345
a knockout will do it.

1441
01:14:49,345 --> 01:14:52,512
(audience chattering)

1442
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:57,682
(bell ringing)

1443
01:14:57,682 --> 01:15:00,682
(audience shouting)

1444
01:15:08,823 --> 01:15:11,740
- One, two, three, four, five, six,

1445
01:15:15,606 --> 01:15:16,689
seven, eight.

1446
01:15:19,163 --> 01:15:19,996
Come on.

1447
01:15:21,182 --> 01:15:22,042
- [Audience Member]
Hold him on the ground.

1448
01:15:22,042 --> 01:15:25,042
(audience shouting)

1449
01:15:28,264 --> 01:15:29,681
- [Referee] Easy.

1450
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:32,826
(audience cheering)

1451
01:15:32,826 --> 01:15:35,409
(somber music)

1452
01:15:43,324 --> 01:15:45,030
- What a windup.

1453
01:15:45,030 --> 01:15:46,020
We lose 20 G's.

1454
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:48,380
We haven't even got a piece of the purse.

1455
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:50,010
- Cleaned me out too.

1456
01:15:50,010 --> 01:15:51,668
- What are you moaning about?

1457
01:15:51,668 --> 01:15:52,501
If it hadn't been for you,

1458
01:15:52,501 --> 01:15:55,111
Hal and I would of never
get roped into this mess.

1459
01:15:55,111 --> 01:15:57,694
(somber music)

1460
01:16:01,924 --> 01:16:03,380
- Well at least the
losers end of the purse

1461
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:04,490
goes for a good cause,

1462
01:16:04,490 --> 01:16:07,110
that recreational hall at St.
Dominic's, that's something.

1463
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:10,100
- Oh, stop your corny philosophizing,

1464
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:11,120
remember what I told you

1465
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,770
about finding yourself a new blackboard

1466
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:13,970
if something went wrong,

1467
01:16:14,850 --> 01:16:16,793
something went wrong.

1468
01:16:16,793 --> 01:16:19,376
(somber music)

1469
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:32,843
- Hello Father.

1470
01:16:42,163 --> 01:16:43,580
- I lost, I lost.

1471
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,440
- No my boy you didn't lose.

1472
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:49,970
This was not defeat, you're
a bigger man for the trying,

1473
01:16:49,970 --> 01:16:51,740
for the sacrifice.

1474
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:53,993
The way you fought
carries its own victories.

1475
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:58,363
Look at the wounds on your
face, don't say you lost.

1476
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:01,953
- Hello, Paul.

1477
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:07,070
- Paul, we'll take you
home when you're ready.

1478
01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:09,140
I've heard rumors that the big gamblers

1479
01:17:09,140 --> 01:17:10,900
lost money betting on you.

1480
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:12,560
Well you fought your fight

1481
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:13,740
and if need be there's a few

1482
01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:17,923
good fast rounds left in
me and a hard left jab.

1483
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:29,260
Just a reminder that our recreation hall

1484
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:31,200
opens on the 10th of next month.

1485
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:33,170
It is yours, young and old alike.

1486
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:34,620
Come and enjoy it

1487
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:36,920
and it is to one of our own sons,

1488
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:39,180
a boy from this very street

1489
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:41,430
to whom we all owe so much for making

1490
01:17:41,430 --> 01:17:45,610
this recreational center
possible so soon, Paul Baroni

1491
01:17:46,660 --> 01:17:48,170
and I am very happy to announce

1492
01:17:48,170 --> 01:17:50,490
that he and his lovely bride Emily

1493
01:17:50,490 --> 01:17:53,350
will be working with us when they return,

1494
01:17:53,350 --> 01:17:56,640
working with us to make
this a better street,

1495
01:17:56,640 --> 01:18:00,430
a better Church, and a better
community in which to live.

1496
01:18:02,455 --> 01:18:05,038
(gentle music)

1497
01:18:28,879 --> 01:18:31,546
(playful music)

1498
01:18:57,852 --> 01:19:00,435
(joyful music)
