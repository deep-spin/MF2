1
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:48,304
Ladies and gentlemen!

2
00:02:48,404 --> 00:02:50,807
When the Morning Star
summoned you to this banquet

3
00:02:50,907 --> 00:02:54,021
I realized that there were
only two people qualified

4
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:57,550
to introduce the great man
we are honoring tonight.

5
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,150
Either my humble self or that
pearl among journalists

6
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,690
Mr. Wallace Cook, my great
friend and star reporter.

7
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,287
You said it.

8
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:11,450
I want Mr. Cook himself to tell
you the great feat he performed

9
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:15,571
not only for the Morning Star,
but for mankind itself

10
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:20,171
in interesting our guest of
honor in this great project.

11
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:36,897
Twenty-seven halls of
learning and culture!

12
00:03:36,997 --> 00:03:39,594
Twenty-seven arenas of art!

13
00:03:39,694 --> 00:03:42,635
To be known as the
Morning Star Temple.

14
00:03:42,735 --> 00:03:47,235
And for every dollar we contribute, our
guest has pledged himself to give ten.

15
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:54,022
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my
great honor to introduce to you

16
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:58,249
A prince with a heart as
big as his pocketbook

17
00:03:58,349 --> 00:04:02,208
that fabulous and magnificent
potentate of the Orient

18
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:06,808
the Sultan of Marzipan.

19
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:17,400
Peace be unto you, my friends.

20
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,000
Peace and the blessings of culture.

21
00:04:32,725 --> 00:04:37,225
That's him.
That's my husband.

22
00:04:56,567 --> 00:05:00,523
Well, my fine
Oriental potentate

23
00:05:00,623 --> 00:05:02,891
I'm not going to have you arrested.

24
00:05:02,991 --> 00:05:07,491
I'm going to put you on the payroll
as a janitor!

25
00:05:07,846 --> 00:05:10,026
Thank you, sir.

26
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:12,572
And I always want you
present in the local room

27
00:05:12,672 --> 00:05:17,172
Where my reporters and Mr. Wallace
Cook can drink you in constantly

28
00:05:19,325 --> 00:05:21,695
As a warning against fakes!

29
00:05:21,795 --> 00:05:22,818
Yeah, sir.

30
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:27,418
May I ask, ain't Mr.
Cook a reporter anymore?

31
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:32,424
I wouldn't like for him to lose his job.
He was very nice to me.

32
00:05:32,524 --> 00:05:36,608
Mr. Cook is not going to be
discharged, Your Majesty.

33
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:40,419
For his own good and the
good of the Morning Star

34
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:45,019
I am going to remove him
from the land of the living!

35
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,855
Listen, Oliver, I tell
you I'm innocent.

36
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:51,586
I was just as fooled by old
black Joe as you were.

37
00:06:51,686 --> 00:06:54,025
I believed everything he
said just as you did.

38
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,107
Now, Oliver.

39
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:59,087
Either you cut out these fat-headed monkeyshines
of yours and let bygones be bygones

40
00:06:59,187 --> 00:07:01,345
or I'm walking out of this
fish trap right here and now.

41
00:07:01,445 --> 00:07:04,423
You're under contract with the
Star for five more years.

42
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:06,203
You're not in a position to resign

43
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:09,727
unless you wish to retire from
journalistic efforts over that period.

44
00:07:09,827 --> 00:07:14,243
Oliver, you're not gonna keep me
pounding out obituaries for five years?

45
00:07:14,343 --> 00:07:18,464
Those are my plans, Mr. Cook.

46
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:21,336
That's gratitude.

47
00:07:21,436 --> 00:07:23,704
I'm the best reporter you ever had.

48
00:07:23,804 --> 00:07:25,880
I've handed you a hundred scoops.

49
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,880
It isn't fair, Oliver.
It isn't human.

50
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,974
Shut up!

51
00:07:32,074 --> 00:07:35,746
Oliver, I... I don't like
to say this, but...

52
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:39,221
The paper is going to rack and ruin with
me hidden away in that water cooler.

53
00:07:39,321 --> 00:07:40,413
- Look at this.
- What's that?

54
00:07:40,513 --> 00:07:43,490
Poor little working girl doomed
to death from radium poisoning.

55
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,442
- We've covered it.
- Covered it?

56
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:47,998
You're getting old, Oliver.

57
00:07:48,098 --> 00:07:51,172
Look, there's 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6 lines on Hazel Flagg.

58
00:07:51,272 --> 00:07:53,750
A poor little kid with a few
months to live at the outside.

59
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,034
Doomed. Death staring
her in the face.

60
00:07:56,134 --> 00:07:58,055
What does she feel?
What does she think?

61
00:07:58,155 --> 00:08:01,155
- Radium eating away her bones!
- Don't shout at me!

62
00:08:01,255 --> 00:08:03,439
Listen, Oliver, there's a story in this
kid that ought to tear your heart out.

63
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,760
Where is it? Why hasn't the Star got it?
I'll tell you.

64
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,129
Because I'm stuck away in the water cooler
on account of some whim of yours.

65
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:10,660
Listen, Oliver, give
me a chance, will you?

66
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,048
So help me may I drop
dead or redeem myself.

67
00:08:13,148 --> 00:08:15,415
- I oughta be shot for what I'm thinking.
- What are you thinking?

68
00:08:15,515 --> 00:08:19,350
I'm thinking that maybe you ain't the
most tittering imbecile on Earth.

69
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,753
I'm thinking that maybe
you've learned your lesson.

70
00:08:21,853 --> 00:08:24,073
Oliver, so help me. I'll
be in Vermont by morning.

71
00:08:24,173 --> 00:08:28,673
I'll dig you up a story that'll make
this town swoon. Here's my hand on it.

72
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:34,500
I've been through an inferno.

73
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,468
I haven't been able to enter a
café for the past three weeks

74
00:08:37,568 --> 00:08:40,050
without the band playing "Dixie".

75
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,099
- Oh well, that was a coincidence.
- I've given you my hand, go on...

76
00:08:43,199 --> 00:08:47,699
- Redeem yourself.
- Thanks. You won't regret it.

77
00:08:48,316 --> 00:08:50,333
If I don't come back with the
biggest story you ever handled

78
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:54,933
you can put me back in short
pants and make me marble editor.

79
00:09:25,883 --> 00:09:28,933
- You through?
- Yep.

80
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:31,977
- You know this girl, Hazel Flagg?
- Yep.

81
00:09:32,077 --> 00:09:35,242
- Pretty girl, eh?
- Yep.

82
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:38,641
- Where is she now? In the hospital?
- Nope.

83
00:09:38,741 --> 00:09:42,341
Just walking around, eh? Laughing
and carrying on, I suppose.

84
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:44,473
Yep.

85
00:09:44,573 --> 00:09:48,227
- What's your name, Coolidge?
- Nope.

86
00:09:48,327 --> 00:09:51,362
Well, if you aren't worn
out talking, what is it?

87
00:09:51,462 --> 00:09:52,369
Bull.

88
00:09:52,469 --> 00:09:56,969
Mr. Bull, my name's Cook.
I'm from the New York Star.

89
00:09:57,292 --> 00:10:01,631
I'm, uh, going to be filing a lot of
stuff with your telegraph office here.

90
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:04,378
- I don't think you are.
- Well, who says?

91
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:08,938
The Paragon Watch Factory owns this town.
They don't care to have any scandal printed.

92
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:12,856
What they say goes.
Better take the next train back.

93
00:10:12,956 --> 00:10:17,102
- What kind of a fellow is this Dr. Downer?
- He won't talk to you.

94
00:10:17,202 --> 00:10:21,586
Nobody talkin' in this town.
Except me. Better go home.

95
00:10:21,686 --> 00:10:26,165
Well, if you don't mind I'll take a little
stroll and have a look at the sights first.

96
00:10:26,265 --> 00:10:28,954
Well, I wouldn't have talked at all if
I knew I was gonna do it for nothin'.

97
00:10:29,054 --> 00:10:31,576
Oh, pardon me.

98
00:10:31,676 --> 00:10:36,176
I forgot I was in Vermont.

99
00:10:41,268 --> 00:10:45,768
All right.

100
00:10:47,517 --> 00:10:50,777
Morning, sister.

101
00:10:50,877 --> 00:10:55,138
- You in charge here?
- Yep.

102
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:58,928
I've been wandering through your
fascinating metropolis for an hour.

103
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:02,563
- Mind if I sit down here?
- Yep.

104
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:07,163
- I guess you misunderstood me.
- Nope.

105
00:11:11,347 --> 00:11:13,170
- You know Hazel Flagg?
- Yep.

106
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:17,529
Any idea where I could
find her this morning?

107
00:11:17,629 --> 00:11:19,762
You're a newspaperman from New York.

108
00:11:19,862 --> 00:11:22,389
- How did you guess that, sister?
- You was described to me.

109
00:11:22,489 --> 00:11:25,006
Will Bull can shoot his mouth
off to all he wants, but not me

110
00:11:25,106 --> 00:11:26,344
nor anybody else in this town.

111
00:11:26,444 --> 00:11:28,561
This drugstore's run by the
Paragon Watch Company

112
00:11:28,661 --> 00:11:33,161
and they don't want any scandalmonger
New Yorkers snoopin' around.

113
00:11:33,619 --> 00:11:38,119
- OK, sister. And how much do I owe you?
- Well, you've tooken up my time...

114
00:11:41,538 --> 00:11:46,038
Thank you very much. I'm sorry that
I've tooken up so much of your time.

115
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:50,914
Sorry.

116
00:12:33,747 --> 00:12:36,887
- Oh. Good morning.
Is Dr. Downer in?

117
00:12:36,987 --> 00:12:39,228
- Yep.

118
00:12:39,328 --> 00:12:41,911
- Is that his office?
- Yep.

119
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,372
Would you tell him Mr. Cook
would like to see him?

120
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:48,972
Tell him yourself.

121
00:13:00,304 --> 00:13:04,186
- Dr. Downer?
- Yep!

122
00:13:04,286 --> 00:13:06,409
My name's Cook. I'm up
here from New York.

123
00:13:06,509 --> 00:13:11,009
Sit down. I'll be
with you in a minute.

124
00:13:14,718 --> 00:13:17,117
- Nice day... Yep.
- Yep.

125
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:19,247
- What have you got, young man?
Hives?

126
00:13:19,347 --> 00:13:21,189
No. No hives.

127
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:25,063
Lotta hives goin' around. Mrs. George
Nasher was took yesterday. Do you know her?

128
00:13:25,163 --> 00:13:28,317
Nope.

129
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:31,616
- Where did you say you were from?
- New York.

130
00:13:31,716 --> 00:13:35,393
I was wondering if you you could tell
me where I could find Hazel Flagg.

131
00:13:35,493 --> 00:13:37,041
- From New York, eh?
- Yep.

132
00:13:37,141 --> 00:13:38,938
You know what I
think, young fella?

133
00:13:39,038 --> 00:13:41,345
I think you're a newspaperman.
I can smell 'em.

134
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:45,945
I've always been able to smell 'em.
Excuse me while I open the windows.

135
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:53,008
I'll tell you briefly what
I think of newspapermen.

136
00:13:53,108 --> 00:13:55,795
The hand of God reaching
down into the mire

137
00:13:55,895 --> 00:13:59,721
Couldn't elevate one of them
to the depths of degradation.

138
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:01,976
Not by a million miles.

139
00:14:02,076 --> 00:14:04,324
I think you're being a little
severe toward my profession.

140
00:14:04,424 --> 00:14:06,463
- Not much, but just a little.
- Nothing of the sort.

141
00:14:06,563 --> 00:14:10,664
I'm a fair-minded man, young fella, but
when you've been robbed, swindled, cheated

142
00:14:10,764 --> 00:14:15,264
for 22 years out of a fortune, it's
pardonable to formulate an opinion!

143
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:17,229
- From New York, eh?
- Yep.

144
00:14:17,329 --> 00:14:21,499
You don't happen to know of a
newspaper called the Morning Star?

145
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:23,044
You have the honor, Dr. Downer,

146
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:26,126
of addressing that newspaper's
most gifted representative.

147
00:14:26,226 --> 00:14:29,714
Moses in the mountains!
You're from the Morning Star?

148
00:14:29,814 --> 00:14:31,552
Stay right where you are.
Don't move!

149
00:14:31,652 --> 00:14:34,218
I'll show you something
that'll freeze ya!

150
00:14:34,318 --> 00:14:37,805
Listen, doctor. I'm getting
sick of this taffy pull.

151
00:14:37,905 --> 00:14:39,899
Where can I get hold
of Hazel Flagg?

152
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:43,227
Don't talk to me about Hazel Flagg!
No, siree!

153
00:14:43,327 --> 00:14:45,641
Here's the evidence.

154
00:14:45,741 --> 00:14:50,241
I appeal to you as a man of learning, Dr.
Downer. What is Miss Flagg's address?

155
00:14:50,752 --> 00:14:53,582
Don't waste my time, young fella.
Here, read that.

156
00:14:53,682 --> 00:14:56,753
That's a copy of an essay I wrote.
Read it. Go on.

157
00:14:56,853 --> 00:14:58,111
Tit for tat.

158
00:14:58,211 --> 00:15:01,480
Give me her address, and I'll pore over
these interesting documents all night.

159
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,390
I entered this contest with
a clean pair of hands.

160
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,254
Who are the six greatest Americans?

161
00:15:07,354 --> 00:15:11,545
I named them and proved why,
writing on one side of the paper.

162
00:15:11,645 --> 00:15:14,616
And what happened? Did I
win the $10,000? No, siree.

163
00:15:14,716 --> 00:15:17,452
Did I win the 5,000? Did they
even try to save their face

164
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:20,344
by giving me one of the
smaller $1,000 prizes?

165
00:15:20,444 --> 00:15:22,953
Not that gang of chicken thieves!

166
00:15:23,053 --> 00:15:25,288
Here's what they gave me, read it.
A check for $1.

167
00:15:25,388 --> 00:15:28,810
- Young fella, for 22 years...
- I must ask you to be reasonable.

168
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,256
- You can't harbor a grudge for 22 years.
- I'll harbor it till I die! Wait and see!

169
00:15:33,356 --> 00:15:37,013
The Morning Star had a chance
to win my respect 22 years ago.

170
00:15:37,113 --> 00:15:40,864
They saw fit to swindle and belittle me.
Very well.

171
00:15:40,964 --> 00:15:43,760
I'll prove to them before I die
who the six great Americans are

172
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,360
And who was entitled
to the first prize!

173
00:15:50,155 --> 00:15:52,317
I could do better in darkest Africa.

174
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:56,917
You know who got that $10,000?
The editor's wife, that's who!

175
00:16:06,325 --> 00:16:10,825
Morning.

176
00:16:17,804 --> 00:16:20,262
You don't have to sit there
looking so dramatic, Hazel.

177
00:16:20,362 --> 00:16:22,225
Like Eliza crossing the ice.

178
00:16:22,325 --> 00:16:24,265
Well, I can't help feeling a little bad.

179
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:27,191
You couldn't either if you
were gonna die any minute.

180
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,283
Well, you can stop giving yourself
the airs of a dying swan.

181
00:16:30,383 --> 00:16:34,163
According to this last analysis
I made, you ain't going to die.

182
00:16:34,263 --> 00:16:36,427
Unless you get run over or something.

183
00:16:36,527 --> 00:16:37,889
What?

184
00:16:37,989 --> 00:16:42,209
You heard me. I don't like
to chew my cabbage twice.

185
00:16:42,309 --> 00:16:45,374
Enoch... Enoch, I-I-I'm
not gonna die?

186
00:16:45,474 --> 00:16:49,441
You're fitter than a fiddle! And stop
gawking at me while I cut myself!

187
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:53,369
Oh, I gotta cry, Enoch.
I can't help it.

188
00:16:53,469 --> 00:16:56,971
Come, come, come, this is no way
to behave in a doctor's office.

189
00:16:57,071 --> 00:17:00,959
Besides, that soap will give you the
darndest bellyache you ever had.

190
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:03,459
Oh, Enoch, you saved my life.

191
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:07,602
Oh, it was nothing. That first
diagnosis I made was a mistake.

192
00:17:07,702 --> 00:17:10,531
I got so that I was seeing
radium poisoning everywhere.

193
00:17:10,631 --> 00:17:14,606
I've been awfully brave, haven't I, not
to cry before? Please say I have...

194
00:17:14,706 --> 00:17:19,206
Well, now that it's over, I don't mind telling
you, Hazel, I felt kinda sorry for you.

195
00:17:20,282 --> 00:17:24,782
Sorry.

196
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:33,161
I've been under a great strain.

197
00:17:36,364 --> 00:17:38,644
You know, I don't know why
I'm so happy about it, Enoch.

198
00:17:38,744 --> 00:17:42,804
You sort of spoiled my trip.

199
00:17:42,904 --> 00:17:43,863
What trip's that, Hazel?

200
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:46,821
You know, I was gonna take that
$200 you get for dying in Warsaw

201
00:17:46,921 --> 00:17:49,595
And go to New York and blow
it all in and die happy.

202
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:51,771
And now I've got to stay in Warsaw.

203
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:55,096
So that's your gratitude to me?

204
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:59,696
For snatching you from
the jaws of death?

205
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:04,505
You know, I don't know which I am,
happy or miserable, I'm all mixed up.

206
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:07,991
Enoch, listen. Do you have to hand
in that report to the factory?

207
00:18:08,091 --> 00:18:10,755
I know it sounds a little dishonest.

208
00:18:10,855 --> 00:18:12,990
I'd do it like a shot, Hazel.

209
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:17,087
Only I'd lose my job the minute they
found out you weren't going to die.

210
00:18:17,187 --> 00:18:19,866
And besides, there's the ethics.

211
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:24,466
Well. Oh, thanks for all your trouble.
I'm terribly grateful, Enoch.

212
00:18:27,645 --> 00:18:31,763
Only it's kind of startling to
be brought to life twice...

213
00:18:31,863 --> 00:18:36,363
And each time in Warsaw!

214
00:18:40,678 --> 00:18:42,110
Miss Flagg?

215
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,875
Pardon me, I'm Wallace Cook
from the New York Star.

216
00:18:44,975 --> 00:18:46,618
I came up to see you.

217
00:18:46,718 --> 00:18:49,949
I know it's hard for you to talk, but if
you'd just listen to me for a while...

218
00:18:50,049 --> 00:18:54,137
I have nothing to say now.
It's sort of too late.

219
00:18:54,237 --> 00:18:55,337
I know how you feel, Miss Flagg.

220
00:18:55,437 --> 00:18:57,891
But I won't ask you any
questions about your ailment.

221
00:18:57,991 --> 00:19:00,623
I was just in to see Dr.
Downer, and he told me...

222
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,821
Now, please don't cry. I was thinking
while I was waiting for you to come out

223
00:19:02,921 --> 00:19:06,283
and I got an idea. I want you
to come to New York with me.

224
00:19:06,383 --> 00:19:07,104
- What?
- As my guest.

225
00:19:07,204 --> 00:19:09,629
As the guest of the Morning Star. Now,
don't say anything till I tell you.

226
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:11,402
- Oh, I'm not saying anything.
- If you were my sister...

227
00:19:11,502 --> 00:19:16,002
or somebody close to me, I'd take you
outta Warsaw dead or alive, Miss Flagg.

228
00:19:16,497 --> 00:19:19,605
Oh, I've always wanted to see
the world outside before I...

229
00:19:19,705 --> 00:19:21,780
- You've lived here all your life, huh?
- Twice as long.

230
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,534
You poor kid. You've
never been to New York?

231
00:19:23,634 --> 00:19:26,471
No, my grandmother took me there when I
was three, but I didn't appreciate it.

232
00:19:26,571 --> 00:19:28,765
Listen, we'll show you the town.
We'll take you everywhere.

233
00:19:28,865 --> 00:19:30,989
You'll have more fun than if
you lived a hundred years

234
00:19:31,089 --> 00:19:33,281
in this moth-eaten
yep-and-nope village.

235
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,135
- That's so very true...
- Is it a bargain?

236
00:19:35,235 --> 00:19:37,497
I don't know. It would be
imposing on everybody because...

237
00:19:37,597 --> 00:19:38,906
Imposing? In what way?

238
00:19:39,006 --> 00:19:41,779
Oh, I just thought it'd be
wrong to make people sad.

239
00:19:41,879 --> 00:19:44,291
- I'd be kind of a killjoy, wouldn't I?
- Listen, I'll be frank with you.

240
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,680
Even if I sound like a ghoul.
You'll be a sensation.

241
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,339
The whole town will
take you to its heart.

242
00:19:48,439 --> 00:19:50,895
You'll have everything you've ever dreamed
of. You'll have it on a silver platter.

243
00:19:50,995 --> 00:19:54,905
You'll be like Aladdin with
the magic lamp to rub.

244
00:19:55,005 --> 00:19:57,433
You mean they'll like me
just because I'm dying?

245
00:19:57,533 --> 00:19:58,698
Oh, that's a cruel way to put it.

246
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,504
No, they'll like you because you'll
be a symbol of courage and heroism.

247
00:20:02,604 --> 00:20:06,008
- We'll talk about it on the plane.
- An aeroplane? You mean we'll fly there?

248
00:20:06,108 --> 00:20:08,648
Sure. Sure, we haven't much time.

249
00:20:08,748 --> 00:20:09,941
Oh, I'm sorry. I mean...

250
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,104
The sooner you get there, the more
time you'll have to enjoy yourself.

251
00:20:12,204 --> 00:20:14,237
You know, I was gonna go there before.
I saved up an hundred dollars.

252
00:20:14,337 --> 00:20:16,940
Now, a hundred million dollars couldn't buy
you the fun the Morning Star can give you.

253
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,165
- Come on.
- Oh no, wait. I gotta take him with me.

254
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:21,664
- Who? The kid on the bicycle?
- Oh no, no. Enoch. Dr. Downer.

255
00:20:21,764 --> 00:20:23,892
You wait here. Oh, you
won't go away, will you?

256
00:20:23,992 --> 00:20:25,968
- Nope.
- Oh, I'll go ask him. Will you wait here?

257
00:20:26,068 --> 00:20:30,568
- Yep.
- Oh, good. Enoch! Enoch!

258
00:20:53,508 --> 00:20:54,756
Oh, Enoch, look!

259
00:20:54,856 --> 00:20:57,169
I don't care for scenery
from this point of view.

260
00:20:57,269 --> 00:20:59,665
But that's the Statue of Liberty!

261
00:20:59,765 --> 00:21:04,265
I've seen it.

262
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:16,920
I got in touch with Oliver.
Oliver Stone, my editor.

263
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,171
He's toe dancing in the
street waiting for us.

264
00:21:19,271 --> 00:21:21,149
Oh, I hope he's nice like you.

265
00:21:21,249 --> 00:21:23,085
Well, he's got a different
quality of charm.

266
00:21:23,185 --> 00:21:26,390
He's sort of a cross between a
Ferris wheel and a werewolf.

267
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:29,497
But with a lovable streak -
if you care to blast for it.

268
00:21:29,597 --> 00:21:31,075
- You're getting nervous?
- Oh no, no.

269
00:21:31,175 --> 00:21:35,126
I just hope he won't have a lot of long-
whiskered doctors lined up to harass me.

270
00:21:35,226 --> 00:21:38,106
You know, I'm not coming to New York to
play guinea pig for a lot of scientists.

271
00:21:38,206 --> 00:21:40,394
Everybody knows that radium
poisoning is incurable

272
00:21:40,494 --> 00:21:44,262
so... so why waste any
time in that direction?

273
00:21:44,362 --> 00:21:47,462
Don't you worry about that.
You won't be bothered at all.

274
00:21:47,562 --> 00:21:51,027
I'm not going to go to bed until I have
convulsions and my teeth start falling out.

275
00:21:51,127 --> 00:21:53,663
That's when I begin
worrying, isn't it, Enoch?

276
00:21:53,763 --> 00:21:56,136
It's as good a time as any.

277
00:21:56,236 --> 00:22:00,736
- How're you feeling now, sailor?
- Hunky dory, Skipper.

278
00:22:00,896 --> 00:22:05,396
Well, there she is, in all
her beads and ribbons.

279
00:22:11,585 --> 00:22:15,520
- Mr. Cook?
- Yeah. Oh, thank you.

280
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:18,372
Oh, it's from Oliver. He's almost
tongue-tied with excitement.

281
00:22:18,472 --> 00:22:20,475
He's... he's worked up
a nutty demonstration.

282
00:22:20,575 --> 00:22:22,799
New York is going to lay
its heart at your feet

283
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:27,165
while the whistles blow and the
bands play and the cameras grind.

284
00:22:27,265 --> 00:22:30,428
How about you, sailor? Anything you
care to say as we go into action?

285
00:22:30,528 --> 00:22:33,404
Oh, I'm going to have a marvelous
time. Whatever happens afterwards -

286
00:22:33,504 --> 00:22:37,937
I mean about the convulsions and all that
- I'm going to have fun first… I am… I am…

287
00:22:38,037 --> 00:22:40,053
Well, if that doesn't make
them cry, nothing will.

288
00:22:40,153 --> 00:22:42,372
Cry? Why should they cry?

289
00:22:42,472 --> 00:22:46,972
Because you're the bravest kid that ever
lived. There's no fake about it this time.

290
00:22:48,689 --> 00:22:53,189
Oh, look!

291
00:24:32,287 --> 00:24:34,248
Don't excite yourself too much.
It's just a fake.

292
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:35,194
What did you say?

293
00:24:35,294 --> 00:24:37,661
I said, don't excite yourself too much.
It's just a fake.

294
00:24:37,761 --> 00:24:40,360
- Who? Who is a fake?
- Those grapplers.

295
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,838
- The only square thing about them is the ring.
- Oh, them!

296
00:24:42,938 --> 00:24:44,257
They're a symbol to the whole town

297
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:47,071
pretending to fight, love,
weep and laugh all the time...

298
00:24:47,171 --> 00:24:48,937
and they're phonies, all of 'em.

299
00:24:49,037 --> 00:24:51,868
- And I head the list.
- Oh no, you don't. Don't say that.

300
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:55,552
Using you to get a bonus and
a byline on the front page.

301
00:24:55,652 --> 00:24:58,515
Making good over your poor,
little pain-racked body and all.

302
00:24:58,615 --> 00:25:00,527
I'm worse than those fake wrestlers.

303
00:25:00,627 --> 00:25:04,286
I feel fine tonight, Wally. You and the
Morning Star have been so wonderful to me.

304
00:25:04,386 --> 00:25:06,973
You know, these wonderful gowns and the
banquets and the theater tickets and...

305
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:08,594
the poetry.

306
00:25:08,694 --> 00:25:11,906
Stop looking so happy
and gallant, will you?

307
00:25:12,006 --> 00:25:16,506
Breaks my heart.

308
00:25:44,394 --> 00:25:48,894
- You all right?
- Oh, yes. I-I feel fine.

309
00:25:53,097 --> 00:25:57,597
Ladies and gentlemen! I have just learned
that Miss Hazel Flagg is in the audience!

310
00:26:08,431 --> 00:26:12,931
I would like to ask this distinguished
audience to observe ten seconds of silence

311
00:26:16,714 --> 00:26:21,214
in respect for Miss Flagg.

312
00:26:46,915 --> 00:26:51,415
Okay, boys.

313
00:27:11,393 --> 00:27:14,488
Would it interfere with your running the
fleet if I ask you something personal?

314
00:27:14,588 --> 00:27:18,069
That's what we're here for,
to get personal. Proceed.

315
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,749
There's a loose halyard fore.
Go and make it fast, will you?

316
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:22,353
- That thing on the top there?
- Yes, my little mariner, yes.

317
00:27:22,453 --> 00:27:24,188
Try not to go overboard.

318
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:27,050
I asked several people,
but they didn't know.

319
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:31,414
- They didn't know what?
- If you were married.

320
00:27:31,514 --> 00:27:34,282
The answer, in capital
letters, is no. N-O.

321
00:27:34,382 --> 00:27:36,227
- N-O?
- Yeah. N-O.

322
00:27:36,327 --> 00:27:39,693
Oh, I see. I don't suppose
newspapermen marry, as a rule.

323
00:27:39,793 --> 00:27:43,759
Not after they're 14 or 15. That's the
dangerous age for the journalist.

324
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:48,359
His ideals are not yet formed and he
falls easy prey to elderly waitresses.

325
00:27:48,685 --> 00:27:52,261
- Once his finer side is born, he waits.
- For what?

326
00:27:52,361 --> 00:27:56,231
For the sound of the flare alarm, Miss
Flagg. Waits to go rushing off for the fire.

327
00:27:56,331 --> 00:27:59,018
- What fire is that, Mr. Cook?
- Love.

328
00:27:59,118 --> 00:28:03,618
- I used to hear about that in Warsaw.
- Yeah. It's gotten around.

329
00:28:30,499 --> 00:28:34,856
- You're having fun?
- Yes. But you know, I get kinda depressed.

330
00:28:34,956 --> 00:28:38,909
You know, last night when I entered
the theater, everybody moaned. Oh.

331
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:43,071
You know, I might as well be
a case of walking cholera.

332
00:28:43,171 --> 00:28:47,671
Don't do that!

333
00:28:49,147 --> 00:28:53,647
Now, I used to love New York when
they went gaga over some celebrity.

334
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,387
Danced in the streets with a
neon light around its heart.

335
00:28:57,487 --> 00:29:01,979
I'm getting fed up with its trick tears
and phony lamentations over you.

336
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:05,042
I'm glad they're phony. It makes
everything all right, in a way.

337
00:29:05,142 --> 00:29:09,642
I mean I wouldn't wanna feel I was
really making all those people suffer.

338
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:24,992
Wally! Wally, look at
that man with the toupee!

339
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,825
Greetings, greetings, my little folks!
Heh-heh.

340
00:29:51,925 --> 00:29:54,008
Tonight, there is one among us

341
00:29:54,108 --> 00:29:58,068
Who adds a bit of unaccustomed
drama to our little rally.

342
00:29:58,168 --> 00:30:02,668
She sits here, eyes sparkling, her
face wreathed in a lovely smile.

343
00:30:04,105 --> 00:30:08,605
Drinking in the charm, the
glitter, the gay sounds of life.

344
00:30:10,813 --> 00:30:14,126
So drink your wine,
laugh and applaud

345
00:30:14,226 --> 00:30:18,726
while this little doomed child
sits saying goodbye to you.

346
00:30:19,506 --> 00:30:24,006
Her last goodbye, with a
grateful smile on her lips.

347
00:30:24,979 --> 00:30:29,479
So on with the show,
my little actors all.

348
00:30:29,696 --> 00:30:34,196
On with the show, for tonight you're
not the famous folk of Broadway.

349
00:30:36,011 --> 00:30:39,437
Tonight you're just a little chorus
laughing and dancing and pirouetting

350
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:43,773
To afford a last brief
hour of mirth and jollity

351
00:30:43,873 --> 00:30:48,373
to America's simplest and sweetest
of heroines

352
00:30:48,533 --> 00:30:53,033
Miss Hazel Flagg.

353
00:31:01,678 --> 00:31:04,280
For good, clean fun, there's
nothing like a wake.

354
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:08,530
Oh please, please,
let's not talk shop.

355
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:13,130
Our next number tonight, ladies and gentlemen,
is entitled "The Heroines of History".

356
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:28,092
Catherine the Great who saved Russia.
She could do it, too.

357
00:31:39,236 --> 00:31:42,776
Lady Godiva who saved her virtue.

358
00:31:42,876 --> 00:31:47,376
That's the way those
things go, folks.

359
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:09,056
Katinka who saved Holland by
putting her finger in the dyke.

360
00:32:10,685 --> 00:32:15,185
Show them the finger, babe.

361
00:32:25,897 --> 00:32:29,311
Pocahontas who saved
Captain John Smith

362
00:32:29,411 --> 00:32:33,911
and later on set him up in
the cough drop business.

363
00:32:46,268 --> 00:32:50,768
Now, ladies and gentlemen, I want you to
meet that little girl from Warsaw, Vermont.

364
00:32:51,005 --> 00:32:55,505
That little soldier whose heroic
smile in the face of death

365
00:32:55,685 --> 00:33:00,185
has wrung tears and cheers from
the great stone heart of the city.

366
00:33:01,256 --> 00:33:05,756
I humbly invite her now to take her place
beside all the great Heroines of History.

367
00:33:08,301 --> 00:33:12,801
Our own Miss Hazel Flagg!

368
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:31,120
Look! Something has
happened to Hazel!

369
00:34:33,962 --> 00:34:36,355
Look out, young fella.
Let me at her.

370
00:34:36,455 --> 00:34:39,710
- Has it... has it come?
- Doctor, I wanna know the worst.

371
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:44,310
I don't want you to spare our feelings.
We're going to press in 15 minutes.

372
00:34:49,803 --> 00:34:53,135
- Is there a chance, doctor?
- I've been expecting something like this.

373
00:34:53,235 --> 00:34:57,735
Let's get her out of here.
Quick.

374
00:34:58,633 --> 00:35:03,133
Please, everybody. Take your seats.
Quiet, please. Take your seats.

375
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:05,565
There must be no commotion.

376
00:35:05,665 --> 00:35:10,165
The show must go on. Hazel
would want it that way.

377
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:18,297
I'm disgusted with you, Hazel. Getting
drunk in the middle of a memorial.

378
00:35:18,397 --> 00:35:20,942
- Now lie down like I tell you.
- I'm not drunk.

379
00:35:21,042 --> 00:35:25,542
I just had a little sip, thassall, and then...
then all of those buffaloes ran over me.

380
00:35:26,161 --> 00:35:28,224
They weren't buffaloes,
they were horses.

381
00:35:28,324 --> 00:35:32,824
- I might've been trampled to death!
- Don't yell, I tell you!

382
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:37,105
If somebody respectable could see you
now, that would be pretty, wouldn't it?

383
00:35:37,105 --> 00:35:38,910
Shame on you!

384
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,488
Take your stockings off!

385
00:35:40,588 --> 00:35:45,088
You're the doctor,
take 'em off yourself.

386
00:35:52,038 --> 00:35:56,538
Say! What are you doing?

387
00:36:04,551 --> 00:36:07,340
If anything happens,
we have to replate.

388
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,837
That's all that counts to
you, isn't it, you birdbrain

389
00:36:09,937 --> 00:36:11,969
With a headline for a heart?

390
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:15,138
That poor, gallant little kid standing in
front of that goofy bunch of horses.

391
00:36:15,238 --> 00:36:17,067
And smiling, just smiling.

392
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:19,721
Don't waste copy on me, Wallace.

393
00:36:19,821 --> 00:36:23,554
Oliver, that's the sweetest, loveliest
kid in there that ever lived.

394
00:36:23,654 --> 00:36:26,513
Yes, you said that
before, Wally.

395
00:36:26,613 --> 00:36:31,113
I'm through. I can't play
pallbearer any longer. I'm resigning.

396
00:36:31,305 --> 00:36:34,210
She's all right, gentlemen.
Sleeping like a little baby.

397
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:37,736
- No! Are you sure?
- Just as if nothing had happened.

398
00:36:37,836 --> 00:36:41,022
She'll be fitter than a
fiddle in the morning.

399
00:36:41,122 --> 00:36:45,622
In the morning,
ya-da-de-dee, da-daa...

400
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,129
Oh.

401
00:36:52,229 --> 00:36:54,656
Oh.

402
00:36:54,756 --> 00:36:58,388
- Oh my Gosh! Miss Rafferty, Miss Rafferty!
- Yes?

403
00:36:58,488 --> 00:37:02,988
Oh, make them stop ringing that phone.
It'll break my head open.

404
00:37:03,572 --> 00:37:06,141
- Hello?
- I don't wanna talk to anybody.

405
00:37:06,241 --> 00:37:10,741
Just a minute. There are twenty little
schoolchildren downstairs to sing for you.

406
00:37:11,673 --> 00:37:13,516
Mr. Stone arranged for it yesterday.

407
00:37:13,616 --> 00:37:18,116
Oh, it's horrible. I'll go mad!

408
00:37:18,542 --> 00:37:21,669
- Send them up.
- You may bring them up, sir.

409
00:37:21,769 --> 00:37:25,620
Oh my Gosh, there's a
sawmill inside my head.

410
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:30,220
You may leave the
room, Miss Rafferty.

411
00:37:32,874 --> 00:37:36,946
I brought you something.

412
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:40,188
Raw eggs.

413
00:37:40,288 --> 00:37:43,024
Just what you need.

414
00:37:43,124 --> 00:37:47,624
Their albumen counteracts
the alcohol.

415
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:54,073
Suck 'em right down.
Settle your stomach.

416
00:37:54,173 --> 00:37:56,628
Go on. I got a whole dozen.

417
00:37:56,728 --> 00:37:59,511
Is this the way drunks feel?

418
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:03,903
Hazel, you got what is known
in medicine as a hangover.

419
00:38:04,003 --> 00:38:08,175
I've got something worse than that.
I've got a conscience.

420
00:38:08,275 --> 00:38:12,176
Keep on sucking that egg, and
your conscience will go away.

421
00:38:12,276 --> 00:38:14,799
I'm ruining him.

422
00:38:14,899 --> 00:38:19,103
Let me have your pulse, Hazel.

423
00:38:19,203 --> 00:38:23,430
Don't jiggle me. My pulse is all right.
I'm as healthy as an ox. Oh!

424
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:24,635
Well, stop groaning then!

425
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:27,384
You old fraud, you know
what I'm groaning about!

426
00:38:27,484 --> 00:38:30,765
Oh, I wish, I wish I had radium
poisoning or something awful.

427
00:38:30,865 --> 00:38:32,616
Then... then I wouldn't ruin him.

428
00:38:32,716 --> 00:38:34,587
Who is this you're ruining, Hazel?

429
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:38,630
- Wallace. Mr. Cook.
- Oh, him. Have another egg.

430
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:41,747
Enoch, listen. He thinks I've helped
him become a great journalist

431
00:38:41,847 --> 00:38:45,054
and they're gonna give him a bonus.
Mr. Stone is… a bonus.

432
00:38:45,154 --> 00:38:47,302
It's coming out of the
$10,000 they owe me.

433
00:38:47,402 --> 00:38:49,589
If I'm not complaining,
why should he worry?

434
00:38:49,689 --> 00:38:52,991
He thinks I've helped him. Helped him.
And it makes him feel bad.

435
00:38:53,091 --> 00:38:54,777
Oh, I can't stand it.

436
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:58,000
You know what'll happen when they find out
I'm a horrible, good-for-nothing fake?

437
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:01,617
They'll blame him. Everybody! They'll
just burn down the newspaper.

438
00:39:01,717 --> 00:39:05,519
And the Mayor, he'll have Wally lynched.
You just wait and see.

439
00:39:05,619 --> 00:39:08,213
Oh, Enoch. Why did you
let me come to New York?

440
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:12,813
If you were only as
honest as you look.

441
00:39:14,105 --> 00:39:17,243
Mr. Cook is here to see Miss Flagg.
Do you feel able to speak to him?

442
00:39:17,343 --> 00:39:21,843
All right, tell him to wait.

443
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:31,631
- Tell him to come in!
- Come in!

444
00:39:36,263 --> 00:39:38,728
- Hello. Hello, Hazel.
- Hello.

445
00:39:38,828 --> 00:39:42,004
Hello, doctor.

446
00:39:42,104 --> 00:39:45,143
It, uh, it won't hurt
her if I visit a while?

447
00:39:45,243 --> 00:39:49,743
She's doing very well
for her last few weeks.

448
00:39:53,078 --> 00:39:57,435
Gee, I'm glad to hear that, Hazel.
I was, uh... we were worried.

449
00:39:57,535 --> 00:40:01,227
Excuse me.

450
00:40:01,327 --> 00:40:03,938
I wouldn't have disturbed you, but,
uh, I'm going away and I thought...

451
00:40:04,038 --> 00:40:07,725
- I might not see you again until...
- You're going away where?

452
00:40:07,825 --> 00:40:10,477
Oh, just to Albany.

453
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:12,855
- What for?
- Just to see the governor.

454
00:40:12,955 --> 00:40:14,989
Wallace, what are you doing
in Albany with the governor?

455
00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:16,716
Now, Hazel, you mustn't
get overwrought.

456
00:40:16,816 --> 00:40:19,440
Well, if it's about me,
I must know about it.

457
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:23,129
It's, uh, about the
arrangements, Hazel.

458
00:40:23,229 --> 00:40:25,031
What arrangements?

459
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,403
For the funeral.

460
00:40:26,503 --> 00:40:28,552
What funeral?

461
00:40:28,652 --> 00:40:29,767
Yours.

462
00:40:29,867 --> 00:40:32,722
Oh.

463
00:40:32,822 --> 00:40:35,117
Have I... Have I shocked you?

464
00:40:35,217 --> 00:40:38,011
Oh no, oh no. Everybody has
to have a funeral sometime.

465
00:40:38,111 --> 00:40:40,948
Well, but not like
yours, darling.

466
00:40:41,048 --> 00:40:44,368
Gee, I meant to keep
it as a surprise.

467
00:40:44,468 --> 00:40:48,968
Oh, it's better this way, your telling
me in advance so I can get used to it.

468
00:40:49,134 --> 00:40:51,069
Oh, I hope it's gonna be a little funeral.

469
00:40:51,169 --> 00:40:53,837
Oh, I'm afraid that's way
way impossible, Hazel.

470
00:40:53,937 --> 00:40:57,997
According to the present registration,
there'll be about 30,000 automobiles

471
00:40:58,097 --> 00:41:02,520
and a considerable group on foot.
About half a million, I think.

472
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:07,120
- Oh, my.
- That's not half enough to mourn for you.

473
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:12,964
Oliver thought we could get the
President, but, uh, he's still fishing.

474
00:41:13,064 --> 00:41:15,568
I arranged to have the Symphony
orchestra there instead.

475
00:41:15,668 --> 00:41:18,077
Well, if it's all arranged,
why are you going to Albany?

476
00:41:18,177 --> 00:41:22,078
Well, uh, I had an idea this morning.

477
00:41:22,178 --> 00:41:25,336
I'm getting the governor to declare a
public holiday for the, uh, occasion.

478
00:41:25,436 --> 00:41:27,246
Oh, like St. Valentine's Day?

479
00:41:27,346 --> 00:41:29,352
I'm glad I told you.

480
00:41:29,452 --> 00:41:33,952
Hazel, I want you to know now and
always. I think you're magnificent.

481
00:41:34,316 --> 00:41:38,044
Oh please, please, don't say that.
Do you have to go away?

482
00:41:38,144 --> 00:41:40,157
Oh, I'll be back by night.

483
00:41:40,257 --> 00:41:43,080
And I've got another surprise for
you, but I-I'll not tell you now.

484
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:47,030
But I've got to hear it.

485
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,405
- Well, I promised you I wouldn't do this.
- You wouldn't do what?

486
00:41:50,505 --> 00:41:52,994
Call in any other doctor.

487
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:57,594
Hazel, I know you have great faith in
Enoch. But I've broken my promise.

488
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:03,010
Dr. Emil Egelhofer is arriving on the
Rex this afternoon. He's from Vienna.

489
00:42:03,234 --> 00:42:06,122
- And I'm bringing him to see you.
- What for?

490
00:42:06,222 --> 00:42:09,883
Hazel, he is the greatest expert
on radium poisoning in the world.

491
00:42:09,983 --> 00:42:14,151
I know it's incurable, but when I heard
he was on the Rex I radioed him.

492
00:42:14,251 --> 00:42:18,751
There's... there's always an outside
chance. You know, just one in a million.

493
00:42:19,276 --> 00:42:23,671
I'm sorry, I... I've got to run
to get the 10 o'clock plane.

494
00:42:23,771 --> 00:42:28,271
Hazel, I-I know it's a long shot, but...
we can hope, hm?

495
00:42:29,793 --> 00:42:32,165
Goodbye.

496
00:42:32,265 --> 00:42:35,930
Goodbye.

497
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:40,530
Pardon me.

498
00:42:43,573 --> 00:42:46,133
- The little children are here, Hazel.
- What little children?

499
00:42:46,233 --> 00:42:48,686
- They've come to sing for you.
- Enoch, this is the end.

500
00:42:48,786 --> 00:42:50,951
Don't ask any questions,
just listen to me. We're caught.

501
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:54,677
Dr. Egelhofer's coming here
tonight to expose me and Wally.

502
00:42:54,777 --> 00:42:58,894
You've got nothing to fear from any
doctor who comes snoopin' around here.

503
00:42:58,994 --> 00:42:59,951
Better have another egg.

504
00:43:00,051 --> 00:43:02,943
There's only one way out. There's only
one way to save you and me and Wally.

505
00:43:03,043 --> 00:43:05,767
I've got to commit suicide in advance
before that scientist gets to me.

506
00:43:05,867 --> 00:43:07,276
- I... I've got to be drowned.

507
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,963
- Awww, suck this egg, I tell you.
- Oh, shut up!

508
00:43:09,063 --> 00:43:12,005
I'll leave a note to the
city thanking everybody.

509
00:43:12,105 --> 00:43:14,736
You get rid of the news for the evening,
and then I'll jump into the river.

510
00:43:14,836 --> 00:43:18,261
Somebody's bound to see me jumping, and you'll
be waiting in a rowboat to fish me out.

511
00:43:18,361 --> 00:43:20,772
And I'll swim underwater,
and I'll change my name

512
00:43:20,872 --> 00:43:25,372
and hide away for the rest of my
life and never, never see him again.

513
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:30,853
And they'll hold the
funeral without me.

514
00:45:02,531 --> 00:45:05,836
Hello, honey. This is Ernest.

515
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:08,619
Honey, what kinda
flowers do you like?

516
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:10,453
Huh?

517
00:45:10,553 --> 00:45:13,372
Don't worry, honey, they
all the same price.

518
00:45:13,472 --> 00:45:15,743
I'm gettin' them wholesale.

519
00:45:15,843 --> 00:45:20,343
Be right up, honey.

520
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:52,229
Hello. Get me the Morning Star. Quick.

521
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:55,239
Who committed suicide?

522
00:45:55,339 --> 00:45:56,449
Read it to me.

523
00:45:56,549 --> 00:45:59,360
Dear New York City, Goodbye.

524
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,961
Remember me as someone
you made very happy.

525
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:07,561
I have enjoyed everything.
There's only one thing left to enjoy.

526
00:46:09,109 --> 00:46:13,499
Your river - that smiled
outside of my window.

527
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:18,099
It is easy to die when the
heart is full of gratitude.

528
00:46:18,658 --> 00:46:23,084
Hazel Flagg.

529
00:46:23,184 --> 00:46:26,096
Hello, Oliver. Well, we get our holiday.
The governor has agreed to...

530
00:46:26,196 --> 00:46:28,820
Shut up.

531
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,068
Jumpin' H. Sebastian.
She's double-crossed us.

532
00:46:32,168 --> 00:46:34,475
- Who has?
- Miss Flagg.

533
00:46:34,575 --> 00:46:37,818
- She's gone over to some other paper?
- She's gone into the river.

534
00:46:37,918 --> 00:46:40,187
Listen, you weasel-brain. What
are you trying to tell me?

535
00:46:40,287 --> 00:46:43,260
Hazel Flagg has committed suicide.

536
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,192
I don't believe it.

537
00:46:44,292 --> 00:46:48,770
Ernest, your Sultan, has
found her suicide note.

538
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:52,122
He saw her leave the
hotel five minutes ago.

539
00:46:52,222 --> 00:46:53,529
Give me the Mayor at once.

540
00:46:53,629 --> 00:46:56,181
Get the governor. Tell him we
want that holiday tomorrow.

541
00:46:56,281 --> 00:46:58,416
You're a fine pair of gravediggers.
You and the governor both.

542
00:46:58,516 --> 00:47:03,016
Hello, hello, Mayor? This is
Wallace Cook of the Star calling...

543
00:47:30,752 --> 00:47:35,252
One... two... three...
Enoch!

544
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:39,978
Enoch!

545
00:47:40,078 --> 00:47:44,255
Okay, Hazel, okay!

546
00:47:44,355 --> 00:47:46,290
One...

547
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:48,394
- Two...
- Hazel!

548
00:47:48,494 --> 00:47:52,994
Stop!

549
00:47:53,378 --> 00:47:54,617
Stop!

550
00:47:54,717 --> 00:47:56,477
Stop!

551
00:47:56,577 --> 00:47:59,730
You freakin' fool! What the
devil's the matter with you?

552
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:04,330
What are you trying to do?

553
00:48:15,637 --> 00:48:19,860
- Wally! Wally! Are you all right?
- Sure! I'm all right!

554
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,969
But I... But I can't swim.

555
00:48:23,069 --> 00:48:27,569
- Wally!
- Give me your hand!

556
00:48:46,137 --> 00:48:48,345
That's a fine, sweet
trick you tried to play.

557
00:48:48,445 --> 00:48:51,641
- Well, why didn't you stay in Albany?
- Jumping off a pier like some hothead.

558
00:48:51,741 --> 00:48:53,944
- I didn't jump, I was pushed!
- Scaring everybody out of their wits...

559
00:48:54,044 --> 00:48:55,212
Stop hollering. I'm-I'm nervous.

560
00:48:55,312 --> 00:48:57,119
Listen, either you give me your word
of honor you won't try that again.

561
00:48:57,219 --> 00:48:58,626
Or I'll spank your little...

562
00:48:58,726 --> 00:49:00,919
Wallace, don't you think you oughta
notify them that you've located me?

563
00:49:01,019 --> 00:49:03,368
You know, it seems unfair to
have 'em dragging the river!

564
00:49:03,468 --> 00:49:06,544
Oh, the fresh air will do 'em good.
Come on, I wanna talk to you.

565
00:49:06,644 --> 00:49:08,984
What...?

566
00:49:09,084 --> 00:49:13,584
This is as good a place as any.
Get in!

567
00:49:14,881 --> 00:49:19,148
Oh, it's awfully cozy, isn't it?
Are you still mad at me?

568
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:20,705
I'm mad at myself.

569
00:49:20,805 --> 00:49:23,858
Drooling away to you about the funeral...
That's what drove you to it!

570
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:26,537
To be really frank with you,
Wallace, it wasn't that at all.

571
00:49:26,637 --> 00:49:31,137
Oh, darling, I'd love to sit in here
with you for the rest of my life.

572
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:38,692
Hazel?

573
00:49:38,792 --> 00:49:40,125
Will you marry me?

574
00:49:40,225 --> 00:49:43,760
- What?
- You heard me. Will you marry me?

575
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:46,302
- Oh, Wally...
- Come on, answer me.

576
00:49:46,402 --> 00:49:48,224
But darling, there's
no future in it.

577
00:49:48,324 --> 00:49:52,011
Now, don't talk like a half-wit.
I don't care about the future.

578
00:49:52,111 --> 00:49:54,137
Oh, Wally, if things
were normal I'd...

579
00:49:54,237 --> 00:49:56,912
Oh, Wally, I... I mustn't.
Don't ask me.

580
00:49:57,012 --> 00:50:01,512
Please, just kiss me once more and let
it go at that without ruining your life.

581
00:50:01,654 --> 00:50:04,765
So what the devil is there
better to life than we've got?

582
00:50:04,865 --> 00:50:08,904
A handful of perfect hours. That's
all the luckiest ever get out of it.

583
00:50:09,004 --> 00:50:13,504
Just a handful of hours
to save and remember.

584
00:50:13,685 --> 00:50:18,185
And then... I'll be there at the end,
sailor. I'll be there waving you goodbye.

585
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:22,095
It'll be the same as if you
and I had lived forever.

586
00:50:22,195 --> 00:50:26,607
And you'll... you'll
grow old in my heart.

587
00:50:26,707 --> 00:50:31,207
Okay, Skipper.

588
00:50:35,153 --> 00:50:38,518
You seen anyting of a young
lady what yumped in the river?

589
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:39,601
Yeah. She's... she's right here.

590
00:50:39,701 --> 00:50:42,100
All right. Yim, get the bullmotor.

591
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:46,700
Oh, never mind the bullmotor.
Now, her breathing's fine.

592
00:50:47,404 --> 00:50:51,904
- Just... drive us to her hotel, will you?
- Sure. Yump in.

593
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:07,099
Yumpin' Yiminy.

594
00:51:08,171 --> 00:51:12,671
- Oh. Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

595
00:51:13,795 --> 00:51:17,622
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

596
00:51:17,722 --> 00:51:21,237
- Ehh... You're welcome.
- Now...

597
00:51:21,337 --> 00:51:24,018
Looks as if I finally get
my ride on a fire engine.

598
00:51:24,118 --> 00:51:28,105
- Yeah.
- Yumpin' Yiminy.

599
00:51:28,205 --> 00:51:30,007
- Uh, Yim?
- Yim.

600
00:51:30,107 --> 00:51:34,607
Okay, Yim!

601
00:51:49,592 --> 00:51:53,349
Gotta go down and bat out the story.
Oliver's having a cat fit.

602
00:51:53,449 --> 00:51:55,116
You know, I've been
misjudging him.

603
00:51:55,216 --> 00:51:59,716
When I told him you were safe and sound, he
choked up and couldn't talk for a minute.

604
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:02,807
- Oh yes, he's very sweet.
- Yeah.

605
00:52:02,907 --> 00:52:05,356
Well, I'll... I'll see
you in the morning.

606
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:09,097
Have a good sleep. Good night.

607
00:52:09,197 --> 00:52:13,397
Yes, it's a big fire. Oh, if
you ever hate me, remember

608
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:17,997
this... and this... and this...
and this and...

609
00:52:24,258 --> 00:52:28,758
The biggest fire since Rome!

610
00:52:41,236 --> 00:52:44,844
Well, well, well. Hello, Hazel.
Come in.

611
00:52:44,944 --> 00:52:49,444
I was wondering
whatever become of you.

612
00:52:49,572 --> 00:52:52,376
Enoch, who is that man?
Enoch, who is that man?

613
00:52:52,476 --> 00:52:55,982
Oh, he's just a stranger from Europe
who dropped in for a little chat.

614
00:52:56,082 --> 00:53:00,582
We've been discussing medicine,
pro and con. Oh, excuse me.

615
00:53:02,606 --> 00:53:05,502
I want to introduce
you to Hazel Flagg.

616
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:07,829
Mister, uh... What did
you same your name was?

617
00:53:07,929 --> 00:53:11,408
Egelhofer. Dr. Emil Egelhofer.

618
00:53:11,508 --> 00:53:14,475
Dr. Awfulegger...

619
00:53:14,575 --> 00:53:17,484
Seems to me I've heard of
you somewhere, doctor.

620
00:53:17,584 --> 00:53:20,106
Oh, Enoch... Enoch,
sit down now.

621
00:53:20,206 --> 00:53:23,705
I received a radio on the ship
from the Morning Star, Miss Flagg,

622
00:53:23,805 --> 00:53:27,423
Which excited my professional
as well as humane interests.

623
00:53:27,523 --> 00:53:31,847
And I called on you at once.

624
00:53:31,947 --> 00:53:35,615
Aaah, that must be my colleagues.

625
00:53:35,715 --> 00:53:40,215
Come right in, gentlemen.

626
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:44,713
This is the young lady,
Miss Hazel Flagg.

627
00:53:44,813 --> 00:53:48,562
Dr. Oswald Vunch of Prague.

628
00:53:48,662 --> 00:53:53,112
Dr. Felix Maratchovsky of Moscow.

629
00:53:53,212 --> 00:53:57,657
Dr. Friedrich Kirchenweisser of Berlin.

630
00:53:57,757 --> 00:54:02,257
All the darkeys am a weeping

631
00:54:03,548 --> 00:54:08,048
Massa's in the cold, cold ground...

632
00:54:11,423 --> 00:54:15,189
There is no vestige, no
trace, no single symptom

633
00:54:15,289 --> 00:54:19,789
Of radium poising in this
young woman, Mr. Stone.

634
00:54:20,128 --> 00:54:24,509
We had some trouble with that
horse doctor from Vermont

635
00:54:24,609 --> 00:54:28,756
But we took the
X-rays regardless.

636
00:54:28,856 --> 00:54:32,709
Are you sure you examined
the right woman

637
00:54:32,809 --> 00:54:35,374
And not some... some impostor?

638
00:54:35,474 --> 00:54:39,974
Oh, ho-ho. The only impostor in this case,
Mr. Stone, is this young woman we examined.

639
00:54:42,132 --> 00:54:46,632
The young woman who is
known as Hazel Flagg.

640
00:54:47,444 --> 00:54:51,795
Here's the full report of this examination.
Here's the X-ray pictures

641
00:54:51,895 --> 00:54:56,395
showing the entire skeleton of this
young woman known as Hazel Flagg.

642
00:54:57,133 --> 00:55:01,115
And here, Mr. Stone, is my bill.

643
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:04,065
Um, um... our bill.

644
00:55:04,165 --> 00:55:08,153
And I will assure you,
not me or my colleagues

645
00:55:08,253 --> 00:55:12,753
will say one single word
of this to the newspapers.

646
00:55:19,436 --> 00:55:22,730
Goodbye. You have nothing more
to worry about, Mr. Stone.

647
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:27,330
Your troubles are over.

648
00:55:33,779 --> 00:55:38,279
Send me up four sluggers from
the Circulation Department.

649
00:55:47,118 --> 00:55:49,063
Got a bulletin and new lead
for you on Hazel Flagg

650
00:55:49,163 --> 00:55:53,507
that's going to wreathe that sourpuss
of yours into a nosegay of smiles.

651
00:55:53,607 --> 00:55:56,574
Now sit tight and
tuck in your ears.

652
00:55:56,674 --> 00:56:00,040
Miss Flagg is getting
married tonight.

653
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:03,791
And wish me luck,
old weasel-brain.

654
00:56:07,391 --> 00:56:09,148
Aw, listen, I know
it sounds hysterical

655
00:56:09,248 --> 00:56:12,004
marrying somebody with
a few weeks to live.

656
00:56:12,104 --> 00:56:16,311
Like honeymooning with a
hearse at the front door.

657
00:56:16,411 --> 00:56:20,911
But, Oliver, it's on the square.

658
00:56:22,586 --> 00:56:24,393
What's the matter with you?

659
00:56:24,493 --> 00:56:28,808
Listen, I want you to be best man...

660
00:56:28,908 --> 00:56:32,488
Are you stewed or something?
I came in for congratulations.

661
00:56:32,588 --> 00:56:35,124
What's up? What's eating you?

662
00:56:35,224 --> 00:56:39,724
I am sitting here, Mr. Cook,
trying to figure some way

663
00:56:40,944 --> 00:56:45,444
Out of the blackest disaster that has
ever struck down an innocent man

664
00:56:46,268 --> 00:56:49,099
since the days of
Judas Ischariot.

665
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:51,629
What are you mumbling about?
What disaster?

666
00:56:51,729 --> 00:56:56,229
I am sitting here, Mr.
Cook, toying with the idea

667
00:56:56,851 --> 00:57:01,351
of removing your heart -
and stuffing it like an olive!

668
00:57:01,904 --> 00:57:04,159
Hang on, Oliver, you're going screwy.
I'll get Watson.

669
00:57:04,259 --> 00:57:07,556
You ruined me.
You ruined the Morning Star.

670
00:57:07,656 --> 00:57:10,609
You blackened forever the
fair name of journalism.

671
00:57:10,709 --> 00:57:15,209
You and that foul botch
of nature, Hazel Flagg!

672
00:57:16,225 --> 00:57:18,405
You got some excuse for those words,
Oliver. Let's have it. Quick.

673
00:57:18,505 --> 00:57:22,629
Excuse?! Excuse?!!!
Look at that!

674
00:57:22,729 --> 00:57:24,583
L-l-l-look at that skeleton!

675
00:57:24,683 --> 00:57:29,183
Not a bone missing, down to the
last healthy vertebra! Intact!

676
00:57:30,002 --> 00:57:33,397
Read that. Rub your nose in it.
That's Hazel Flagg.

677
00:57:33,497 --> 00:57:35,208
The biggest fake of the century.

678
00:57:35,308 --> 00:57:39,808
A lying, faking witch with the soul of
an eel and the brain of a tarantula.

679
00:57:40,438 --> 00:57:43,455
She hasn't got anything
wrong with her at all.

680
00:57:42,555 --> 00:57:45,061
Sweet heaven, I can't believe it.

681
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:46,960
It's like some miracle.

682
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:49,531
Get me the Waldorf Hotel
as quick as you can!

683
00:57:49,631 --> 00:57:51,297
Grab Hazel Flagg and
bring her to this office!

684
00:57:51,397 --> 00:57:53,440
If you have to drag her through
the street by the hair!

685
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:55,886
So help me, Oliver, if you hurt that kid,
I'll knock you cold. I'll brain you!

686
00:57:55,986 --> 00:57:59,304
You stay here and watch that maniac.
Watch every move he makes.

687
00:57:58,404 --> 00:58:02,438
I want Hazel Flagg in this
office within half an hour!

688
00:58:02,538 --> 00:58:04,791
- You're staying here!
- Now, Oliver, you're not gonna hurt her...

689
00:58:04,891 --> 00:58:06,350
- Shut up!
- I'm marrying her.

690
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:08,444
Get that into that
monkey skull of yours.

691
00:58:08,544 --> 00:58:10,367
I don't care how we've been taken or
what she's done. I'm in love with her…

692
00:58:10,467 --> 00:58:12,874
- Oh, that's a beautiful thought.
- And I thank God on my knees...

693
00:58:12,974 --> 00:58:15,152
...that she's a fraud and a
fake and isn't going to die.

694
00:58:15,252 --> 00:58:18,789
You're on your knees thanking God when the
whole town's getting ready to laugh at us.

695
00:58:18,889 --> 00:58:20,787
A howl that'll be heard
around the world!

696
00:58:20,887 --> 00:58:22,550
Let 'em laugh. I'll do
my own laughing back.

697
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:26,935
- It'll be worse than the French Revolution.
- Well, I hope I'm here when it breaks.

698
00:58:27,035 --> 00:58:30,474
I wanna make one speech to our dear readers
before they carry our heads off on a pike.

699
00:58:30,574 --> 00:58:33,095
Wanna tell 'em we've
been their benefactors.

700
00:58:33,195 --> 00:58:35,534
We gave 'em a chance to pretend
that their phony hearts

701
00:58:35,634 --> 00:58:39,374
were dripping with the milk of
human kindness.

702
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:41,908
- What's your name?
- Who, me? Max.

703
00:58:42,008 --> 00:58:46,508
I want quiet in this office, Max.
Quiet so I can think…

704
00:58:48,006 --> 00:58:50,504
- Hazel Flagg's a fraud, eh?
- Gag him!

705
00:58:50,604 --> 00:58:53,779
So when you start yelling "foul", remember
she was just a circulation stunt for you.

706
00:58:53,879 --> 00:58:56,844
You used her like you've used every broken
heart that's fallen into your knap-sack.

707
00:58:56,944 --> 00:59:00,194
To inflame the daffy public
and help sell your papers.

708
00:59:00,294 --> 00:59:04,794
That's enough about
sellin' papers!

709
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:19,187
Before I finish with that female
Dracula, she'll know one thing -

710
00:59:19,287 --> 00:59:23,787
that Oliver Stone is worse than radium
poisoning four ways from the Jack!

711
00:59:26,754 --> 00:59:31,254
Hello? Hello? Who? Moe? Moe who?

712
00:59:32,058 --> 00:59:33,417
Who's Moe Levinsky?

713
00:59:33,517 --> 00:59:36,636
That's my brother. You sent him
over to get that girl. Remember?

714
00:59:36,736 --> 00:59:40,861
Oh, Moe. Listen. What? What's that?

715
00:59:40,961 --> 00:59:44,942
Well, what are you stalling for? Get her
back here to the office as I ordered.

716
00:59:45,042 --> 00:59:47,450
Get the mush out of your
mouth, man, and speak up!

717
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:50,772
He's a dumb cluck, Mr. Stone.
You better let me talk to him.

718
00:59:50,872 --> 00:59:54,492
You'll just get him excited...
then he's gone.

719
00:59:54,592 --> 00:59:59,092
Hello, Moe? This is Max.
What's on your mind?

720
01:00:00,323 --> 01:00:04,823
Uh-huh... Uh-huh...
Tsk. That's a shame.

721
01:00:05,218 --> 01:00:08,677
- What is it?
- I'm gettin' it.

722
01:00:08,777 --> 01:00:11,122
Go on, Moe. And take it easy.

723
01:00:11,222 --> 01:00:15,722
Uh-huh... Uh-huh...
You don't say.

724
01:00:17,441 --> 01:00:20,499
Look, Moe. Hold the wire, will you?
I'll take it up with Mr. Stone.

725
01:00:20,599 --> 01:00:21,595
Well?

726
01:00:21,695 --> 01:00:24,884
He wants to know where he can get a doctor.
This girl is sick.

727
01:00:24,984 --> 01:00:27,532
- Who's sick?
- This girl. Hazel Flagg.

728
01:00:27,632 --> 01:00:28,522
It's a lie!

729
01:00:28,622 --> 01:00:30,966
Listen, Max, ask him
what she's sick with.

730
01:00:31,066 --> 01:00:34,327
He told me. He said it's
something like the DTs.

731
01:00:34,427 --> 01:00:36,053
Only the dope can't
pronounce it.

732
01:00:36,153 --> 01:00:38,751
- Well, is the nurse there?
- Just a minute.

733
01:00:38,851 --> 01:00:43,175
Hello, M- ... Hello, Moe?
This is Max.

734
01:00:43,275 --> 01:00:45,641
Your brother, Max!

735
01:00:45,741 --> 01:00:46,904
He's gettin' rattled.

736
01:00:47,004 --> 01:00:51,504
Now, don't fly off the handle, Moe. All
I wanna know - is the noisse there?

737
01:00:52,785 --> 01:00:57,155
No, not a noise. A noisse!
Like a tootsie!

738
01:00:57,255 --> 01:00:59,739
Thaaat's right.

739
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:03,243
- Uh-huh... Uh-huh...
- Give me that phone.

740
01:01:03,343 --> 01:01:07,247
- I'm gettin' there...
- Give me that phone, I tell you!

741
01:01:07,347 --> 01:01:10,022
- Here's the noisse.
- Miss Rafferty?

742
01:01:10,122 --> 01:01:12,104
Oliver Stone.

743
01:01:12,204 --> 01:01:15,738
Pneumonia?
It's a lie, I tell you.

744
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,599
Temperature of 106?
Dying?

745
01:01:17,699 --> 01:01:21,519
Go back and take her temperature again. I
don't trust that girl until I get a doctor.

746
01:01:21,619 --> 01:01:23,961
No, not Dr. Downer!

747
01:01:24,061 --> 01:01:27,828
Tell Moe to throw that Vermont quack out
of the room the minute he shows his face.

748
01:01:27,928 --> 01:01:29,172
Get me Moe.

749
01:01:29,272 --> 01:01:33,274
Pneumonia? It's the finger
of God if it's true.

750
01:01:33,374 --> 01:01:37,054
Listen, Moe. Don't let anybody
leave that room until I get there.

751
01:01:37,154 --> 01:01:40,440
Dead or alive, nobody
leaves that room. Get me?

752
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:44,368
It's like a pardon from the gallows.
But I'm trusting nobody this time.

753
01:01:44,468 --> 01:01:46,186
I'm taking no chances.

754
01:01:46,286 --> 01:01:50,595
Hello? Hello? Get me
Dr. Emil Egelhofer of Vienna.

755
01:01:50,695 --> 01:01:53,357
Wherever he is.
Well, try all the hotels.

756
01:01:53,457 --> 01:01:57,497
Listen, Oliver. I'm going over there.
And if you try to stop me

757
01:01:57,597 --> 01:01:59,939
So help me, I'll get you,
if it takes all my life.

758
01:02:00,039 --> 01:02:01,368
Nobody is going to stop you now.

759
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:05,268
If that little girl is sick,
your place is by her side.

760
01:02:05,368 --> 01:02:09,064
Yes. Dr. Emil Egelhofer of Vienna.

761
01:02:09,164 --> 01:02:11,808
Well, try the medical center.

762
01:02:11,908 --> 01:02:16,408
Try Schulz's Beer Garden!

763
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,846
No, I don't want to see the Mayor.
Take the Mayor away from me.

764
01:02:23,946 --> 01:02:26,973
I want Wallace. Wallace, where are you?

765
01:02:27,073 --> 01:02:29,412
Cut out the shenanigans, will you?
We haven't got any time to lose.

766
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:32,991
Oh. Wally. Wally, I'm on fire.
Wally...

767
01:02:33,091 --> 01:02:35,089
Now, shut up for a minute
and listen to me.

768
01:02:35,189 --> 01:02:37,282
Egelhofer is gonna be here
in ten or fifteen minutes.

769
01:02:37,382 --> 01:02:39,002
- Egelhofer.

770
01:02:39,102 --> 01:02:43,226
Dr. Emil Egelhofer of Vienna.

771
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:45,984
- I knew you were faking the minute I…
- Oh, Wally, they were gonna arrest me.

772
01:02:46,084 --> 01:02:50,584
I couldn't get away. I put the thermometer
under the hot water and threw a fit.

773
01:02:51,153 --> 01:02:54,086
Oh, Wally, you hate me. I knew you'd
hate me. I told you, I told you...

774
01:02:54,186 --> 01:02:55,883
Let's not go into that now.

775
01:02:55,983 --> 01:02:59,919
Oh, Egelhofer, he'll expose me
again, and there's four of them.

776
01:03:00,019 --> 01:03:02,424
- Keep your head and listen to me.
- You hate me.

777
01:03:02,524 --> 01:03:05,705
- Now shut up. Where's the hot water?
- It's in there.

778
01:03:05,805 --> 01:03:08,817
As if I didn't know...

779
01:03:08,917 --> 01:03:11,559
- Have you got two thermometers?
- Three. I've got three.

780
01:03:11,659 --> 01:03:12,997
- Two are enough.

781
01:03:13,097 --> 01:03:15,569
You'll never forgive me for
what I've done to you.

782
01:03:15,669 --> 01:03:18,870
Wally, I wanna die. Honest, I
don't wanna live another minute.

783
01:03:18,970 --> 01:03:21,614
Must've been a lot of fun playing
me for the world's prize chump.

784
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:23,483
- Where's the other thermometer?
- Here.

785
01:03:23,583 --> 01:03:27,092
Wallace Cook, king of the boobs. The
only genuine horse's neck on the market.

786
01:03:27,192 --> 01:03:28,650
I didn't mean it. Really, I didn't...

787
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:32,148
All right, shut up and listen to the greatest
sucker in Christendom, and listen hard.

788
01:03:32,248 --> 01:03:34,204
- Egelhofer is coming.
- With his gang?

789
01:03:34,304 --> 01:03:35,201
What gang?

790
01:03:35,301 --> 01:03:38,544
Well, he's got a wagonload of scientists with
him, with microscopes and searchlights...

791
01:03:38,644 --> 01:03:42,028
- Oh, I'm sunk. I give up.
- Get out of bed.

792
01:03:42,128 --> 01:03:45,464
No, no. Let them arrest
me and put me in prison.

793
01:03:45,564 --> 01:03:48,214
Well, you won't hate me so
much if I'm behind bars.

794
01:03:48,314 --> 01:03:51,501
Listen, my dying swan. This
is no time to stop faking.

795
01:03:51,601 --> 01:03:53,624
You're gonna have pneumonia, and
you're gonna have it good.

796
01:03:53,724 --> 01:03:55,914
Why, you want me to stand in front
of the window and catch cold?

797
01:03:56,014 --> 01:03:58,563
No, that would take too long.

798
01:03:58,663 --> 01:04:02,855
We gotta raise your pulse to 160. Quick.
We gotta have you a-gasping, panting

799
01:04:02,955 --> 01:04:04,963
and covered with a cold sweat
inside of five minutes.

800
01:04:05,063 --> 01:04:08,238
- How?
- How? I don't... Fight. Fight!

801
01:04:08,338 --> 01:04:10,592
Come on. Come on, Delilah,
up with your dukes.

802
01:04:10,692 --> 01:04:14,198
Oh, I can't. I'm sick
of faking and lying.

803
01:04:14,298 --> 01:04:15,925
Take that ice pack off
your head and fight.

804
01:04:16,025 --> 01:04:19,819
No, no, what's the use?
Why fool them any longer?

805
01:04:19,919 --> 01:04:23,013
Because I love you.

806
01:04:23,113 --> 01:04:24,488
Because I'm going to marry you.

807
01:04:24,588 --> 01:04:26,699
And I don't wanna spend my
honeymoon hanging around Sing-Sing

808
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:28,907
blowing kisses to you
in the exercise yard!

809
01:04:29,007 --> 01:04:32,766
Come on, stop dogging it. You've
got to be bathed in perspiration!

810
01:04:32,866 --> 01:04:36,071
- Come on, get going, you little crook!
- Who's a crook?!

811
01:04:36,171 --> 01:04:38,441
You and your crooked
newspapermen...

812
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:42,980
That's my baby! Come on, keep
moving, snake brains. Come on.

813
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:47,079
I'll kill you! Dragging me around like
I was a prize pig with a blue ribbon!

814
01:04:47,179 --> 01:04:51,222
There's no blue ribbons on you, baby.
Just a big yellow sign marked "fake".

815
01:04:51,322 --> 01:04:55,547
I'm a fake, huh? I'm a fake? What are you?
And that phony Santa Claus, Oliver Stone?

816
01:04:55,647 --> 01:04:58,912
Slobbering and drooling all over me...
That's for the Heroines of History!

817
01:04:59,012 --> 01:05:01,196
Mh-hm. And that's
for your Aunt Mary!

818
01:05:01,296 --> 01:05:02,651
Come on. Keep moving,
my little fraud.

819
01:05:02,751 --> 01:05:07,251
I'm not gonna forgive you as long as I live!
I'll just hate you, I'll just hate you...

820
01:05:08,379 --> 01:05:12,275
Let go of me! Let go of me!

821
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:15,355
Oh, I hate you!

822
01:05:16,455 --> 01:05:18,322
You're gonna have plenty
of reason to hate me.

823
01:05:18,422 --> 01:05:21,216
I'm gonna show you cards and spades
in lying for the next fifty years.

824
01:05:21,316 --> 01:05:22,761
I'm gonna pay you back for
every lie you told.

825
01:05:22,861 --> 01:05:26,196
I'm gonna flirt and lie and cheat and swindle
right through to our Golden Wedding.

826
01:05:26,296 --> 01:05:29,471
- Yeah, yeah. Let me hit you just once.
- All right. Come on.

827
01:05:29,571 --> 01:05:33,322
Yep. That's it. Come on, keep coming.
Faster. Faster. Come on.

828
01:05:33,422 --> 01:05:37,922
Keep coming. Faster. Faster. That's it.
Keep swinging. That's the girl. That's it.

829
01:05:38,165 --> 01:05:41,623
- What's the matter? Come on.
- Oh, I'm getting dizzy.

830
01:05:41,723 --> 01:05:45,543
Well, that's fine. That's fine. Now
listen to me, and listen carefully.

831
01:05:45,643 --> 01:05:48,023
When you come to, I want you
to remember what I'm saying.

832
01:05:48,123 --> 01:05:51,015
- What do you mean, come to?
- I mean, when you regain consciousness.

833
01:05:51,115 --> 01:05:54,221
I want you to switch thermometers. Put
the hot one in your mouth, you get me?

834
01:05:54,321 --> 01:05:56,703
Yeah, yeah. Let me
sock you just once.

835
01:05:56,803 --> 01:05:59,793
Just once on the jaw, and
I don't care what happens.

836
01:05:59,893 --> 01:06:01,569
All right. Come on.

837
01:06:01,669 --> 01:06:04,648
I just heard the elevator door. They're
coming. Don't forget about the thermometer.

838
01:06:04,748 --> 01:06:07,741
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right. Say good night to Papa now.

839
01:06:07,841 --> 01:06:12,341
Why? What are you gonna do?

840
01:06:43,322 --> 01:06:47,822
You put up a nice fight, Wally.

841
01:06:49,952 --> 01:06:51,708
You mean to say you
saw the whole thing?

842
01:06:51,808 --> 01:06:53,922
From the beginning, Mr. Cook.

843
01:06:54,022 --> 01:06:56,425
You mean to say you stood there and
let me beat up a defenseless woman?

844
01:06:56,525 --> 01:06:59,173
- I did, Mr. Cook.
- Where's your sense of chivalry?

845
01:06:59,273 --> 01:07:03,580
My chivalry? Aren't you just a trifle
confused, Mr. Cook? You hit her!

846
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:08,180
That's entirely different. I love her!

847
01:07:19,525 --> 01:07:24,025
Water. Water! I'm on fire!
I'm hot as a coal...

848
01:07:25,885 --> 01:07:29,289
Well, you can cool off now, Hazel.
The jig is up.

849
01:07:29,389 --> 01:07:31,035
What? What?!

850
01:07:31,135 --> 01:07:33,422
The jig is up!

851
01:07:33,522 --> 01:07:36,840
You mean to say the whole thing was...
was for... was for nothing?

852
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:37,693
Yeah, I'm sorry...

853
01:07:37,793 --> 01:07:39,522
You thought you could put one
over on Oliver Stone, eh?

854
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:44,056
- Well, I guess I still know a fake when I...
- You keep out of this!

855
01:07:44,156 --> 01:07:48,656
- Wally...
- Yes, dear?

856
01:07:55,282 --> 01:07:59,782
Oh, Wally. I didn't mean to do it, I didn't
mean to do it. I love you, I love you...

857
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:07,940
Miss Flagg, I wonder if you're aware of
the traditions of a great newspaper.

858
01:08:08,564 --> 01:08:12,964
Do you realize what it means to those who
carry aloft the torch of journalism?

859
01:08:13,064 --> 01:08:15,441
From the highest editor
to the lowest office boy

860
01:08:15,541 --> 01:08:19,376
the life-blood of a newspaper,
Miss Flagg, is its integrity.

861
01:08:19,476 --> 01:08:20,524
Am I right, Wally?

862
01:08:20,624 --> 01:08:22,690
Word for word.

863
01:08:22,790 --> 01:08:25,619
I wrote that speech for
you ten years ago

864
01:08:25,719 --> 01:08:27,942
At the Cleveland
convention, you remember?

865
01:08:28,042 --> 01:08:31,476
You can both talk all you want.
I've made up my mind.

866
01:08:31,576 --> 01:08:32,533
Your what?

867
01:08:32,633 --> 01:08:34,729
- I'm through.
- What do you mean, you're through?

868
01:08:34,829 --> 01:08:37,783
I'm gonna confess. I'm going back
to Warsaw. They love me there.

869
01:08:37,883 --> 01:08:40,056
They don't hit me on the jaw
and push me in rivers...

870
01:08:40,156 --> 01:08:41,823
But you can't confess.

871
01:08:41,923 --> 01:08:45,262
Do you realize that out there are some of
the most important citizens of this town?

872
01:08:45,362 --> 01:08:48,919
All of those people are out there by
special invitation from the Morning Star.

873
01:08:49,019 --> 01:08:53,519
And why? To pass on to the people of
New York, to the people of the world

874
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:56,575
your last words.

875
01:08:56,675 --> 01:08:59,967
- For instance?
- Ah, this is no time for sarcasm, Wally.

876
01:09:00,067 --> 01:09:02,951
You got me into this, you get me out.
Use your brain.

877
01:09:03,051 --> 01:09:04,738
Mine's stunned.

878
01:09:04,838 --> 01:09:08,346
Where's Dr. Downer? Where's
that weasel-hearted medico?

879
01:09:08,446 --> 01:09:09,954
He's been on a toot.

880
01:09:10,054 --> 01:09:12,977
We could use him. We could
throw him to the wolves.

881
01:09:13,077 --> 01:09:17,341
Just when we need
him, he isn't here.

882
01:09:17,441 --> 01:09:21,648
I got an idea. We can bury her.
Like they do in India.

883
01:09:21,748 --> 01:09:26,040
You know, like the Yogis. We can stick
a tube down for her to breathe through

884
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:30,343
and dig her up in the
morning with no harm done.

885
01:09:30,443 --> 01:09:34,498
- Nothing doing ...!
- Wally! Stop her! Stop her!

886
01:09:34,598 --> 01:09:38,040
- I'm a... I'm a...
- Stop her!

887
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:40,982
I'm a fake, I'm a phony, I'm not gonna die.
I was never gonna die.

888
01:09:41,082 --> 01:09:43,548
I never had radium poisoning,
I never had anything.

889
01:09:43,648 --> 01:09:45,249
I wanted a trip to New
York, and I got it.

890
01:09:45,349 --> 01:09:48,861
And what's more, you and
New York can go... fine!

891
01:09:48,961 --> 01:09:53,461
- Mr. Stone, is this true?
- Uh... uh... yes.

892
01:09:55,724 --> 01:09:59,987
Well, this is terrible. Terrible. I
endorsed this thing. I sponsored this girl.

893
01:10:00,087 --> 01:10:01,878
I gave her the key to the city.

894
01:10:01,978 --> 01:10:06,478
And just as an election was coming up.

895
01:10:07,584 --> 01:10:10,281
Here's your key. I won't
be needing it anymore.

896
01:10:10,381 --> 01:10:13,976
Miss Flagg, I represent
100,000 young matrons.

897
01:10:14,076 --> 01:10:17,667
We switched a whole study course
from "The Menace of Communism"

898
01:10:17,767 --> 01:10:19,547
to "The Inspiration of Hazel Flagg".

899
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:24,147
Miss Flagg. The Girlfriends of the Forest
have just organized a Hazel Flagg Unit

900
01:10:24,388 --> 01:10:28,309
With me as Chief Ranger.
Already, we are 4,000 members.

901
01:10:28,409 --> 01:10:32,909
If you persist in flaunting your
recovery in this flagrant manner

902
01:10:33,722 --> 01:10:38,222
The trees of America will
be without girlfriends.

903
01:10:41,702 --> 01:10:46,202
Ladies and gentlemen, the Morning
Star keeps faith with its readers.

904
01:10:46,751 --> 01:10:49,160
This thing must not get out.

905
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:51,759
Oh, let me alone. I wish
I really could die...

906
01:10:51,859 --> 01:10:54,930
Go someplace by myself and...
and die alone!

907
01:10:55,030 --> 01:10:59,530
Like an elephant!

908
01:11:59,351 --> 01:12:02,852
Happy, Mr. Cook?

909
01:12:02,952 --> 01:12:07,452
Ecstatic, Mrs. Cook.

910
01:12:15,834 --> 01:12:19,306
I know what you're gonna say.
You think I'm Hazel Flagg.

911
01:12:19,406 --> 01:12:23,377
Well, I'm getting sick and tired of
people mistaking me for that fake!

912
01:12:23,477 --> 01:12:26,372
Fake? Young woman, how dare you
speak of Hazel Flagg as a fake?

913
01:12:26,472 --> 01:12:30,972
How dare you slur the memory of one of
the most gallant girls that ever lived?

914
01:12:32,093 --> 01:12:36,593
Despite you and your kind the world
will never forget Hazel Flagg.

915
01:12:37,965 --> 01:12:39,776
That's what I'm afraid of.

916
01:12:39,876 --> 01:12:43,886
Don't worry, baby. Two months from now,
they won't know who Hazel Flagg was.

917
01:12:43,986 --> 01:12:45,449
They'll find another elephant.

918
01:12:45,549 --> 01:12:48,408
Darling, you're forgetting that everybody
in New York knew me and loved me.

919
01:12:48,508 --> 01:12:51,170
Loved me for my courage,
my brave smile in the face of...

920
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:53,662
Well, after all, I was a
pretty important person.

921
01:12:53,762 --> 01:12:56,783
Just a flash in the pan of Manhattan.

922
01:12:56,883 --> 01:12:58,389
And they were beginning
to get pretty impatient

923
01:12:58,489 --> 01:13:00,234
at the way you were
dragging the thing out.

924
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:01,517
That's a lie, and you know it.

925
01:13:01,617 --> 01:13:04,642
Why, right now, millions of people
are crying just thinking about me.

926
01:13:04,742 --> 01:13:06,292
Why don't you get wise
to yourself, Hazel?

927
01:13:06,392 --> 01:13:09,824
You're just another freak, like the
Bearded Lady, Jo-Jo the Dog-face...

928
01:13:09,924 --> 01:13:12,045
- Take that back, or I'll...
- Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.

929
01:13:12,145 --> 01:13:14,481
Hazel! Hazel!

930
01:13:14,581 --> 01:13:17,053
Yes, Enoch. What is it?

931
01:13:17,153 --> 01:13:19,792
Hazel!

932
01:13:19,892 --> 01:13:24,034
Hazel!

933
01:13:24,134 --> 01:13:27,071
Run for your life!
Run for your life!

934
01:13:27,171 --> 01:13:31,671
The whole town is flooded!
Flooded...
