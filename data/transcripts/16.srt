2
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,400
Oh, Miss Minter, you mustn't turn that off.

3
00:01:31,401 --> 00:01:32,501
It's getting on my nerves.

4
00:01:32,502 --> 00:01:36,102
Sorry, but it's Mrs. Mantel's orders.
Mrs. Mantel? Who's she?

5
00:01:36,103 --> 00:01:39,303
She's Mr. Smith's mother-in-law.
She wasn't home for dinner tonight.

6
00:01:39,304 --> 00:01:41,504
I didn't even know he was married
until a few moments ago.

7
00:01:41,505 --> 00:01:43,705
He's inclined to forget it himself at times.

8
00:01:43,706 --> 00:01:46,606
He's uh... very susceptible.

9
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:49,107
That Simon Legree susceptible?

10
00:01:49,508 --> 00:01:52,308
Maybe my "it" isn't working today.

11
00:01:52,309 --> 00:01:54,209
The day isn't over yet.

12
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:56,510
What do you mean?

13
00:01:56,511 --> 00:02:00,311
As night goes on, at 8 o'clock, to be precise,
he changes.

14
00:02:00,312 --> 00:02:01,612
Changes? How?

15
00:02:01,613 --> 00:02:05,213
Well, during the day, Mr. Smith is a lawyer,
a businessman.

16
00:02:05,214 --> 00:02:10,314
But at 8 o'clock a little bird starts singing in his soul
and he begins to bloom.

17
00:02:10,315 --> 00:02:13,999
Bloom?
Any pretty woman can twist him around the finger.

18
00:02:14,616 --> 00:02:16,216
Any pretty woman?

19
00:02:17,517 --> 00:02:19,817
The prettier she is the more twisted he gets.

20
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:26,818
It's what they call pre-natal influence.
That's a new alibi for an old complaint.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,119
You notice the lady of the song is called Madeline.

22
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,800
That's Mrs. Smith's name also.
Oh...

23
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:36,901
And mother-in-law's idea is to keep the husband's mind
on his absent wife, eh?

24
00:02:36,902 --> 00:02:38,802
Exactly.
Andrews!

25
00:02:38,803 --> 00:02:40,203
Yes, sir?

26
00:02:43,604 --> 00:02:45,504
His mind is very active tonight.

27
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,505
Audubon 2456.

28
00:02:55,206 --> 00:02:56,406
Yes, please.

29
00:03:01,407 --> 00:03:02,607
Hello?

30
00:03:03,908 --> 00:03:05,208
Hello, Minty!

31
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:08,709
Hey, listen, Diane. Your husband didn't forget himself
and stay home tonight, did he?

32
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,110
No, he's out again.
Well listen, this is very important.

33
00:03:12,111 --> 00:03:14,611
You put on your prettiest dress and come on over here.

34
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:17,912
I found the very lawyer to get your divorce for you.

35
00:03:17,913 --> 00:03:22,313
And from all I hear it won't cost you
any more than a smile or two.

36
00:03:22,314 --> 00:03:24,314
That sounds great, Minty.
Who is he?

37
00:03:26,715 --> 00:03:29,215
I say, who is he and where can I find him?

38
00:03:29,216 --> 00:03:31,116
He's a lawyer I started working for today.

39
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:33,917
Mr. Richard Smith. You know the address.

40
00:03:33,918 --> 00:03:38,518
And, uh, Diane... get here by 8 o'clock.

41
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,719
Yes, 8 o'clock.
Will you come?

42
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,420
Sure, I'll be there.

43
00:04:00,121 --> 00:04:04,021
Miss Minter, Mr. Smith wants you to bring
your notebook and pencil.

44
00:04:04,022 --> 00:04:06,122
More dictation?

45
00:04:07,023 --> 00:04:09,423
Remarkable how active his mind is tonight.

46
00:04:09,424 --> 00:04:12,600
It's nearly 8 o'clock. You had better hurry.

47
00:04:12,601 --> 00:04:17,901
Hurry nothing.
I want to see how a man acts when he... blooms.

48
00:04:27,302 --> 00:04:30,502
Good evening, Andrews. I hope you haven't kept
dinner waiting for me.

49
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,803
No, mam.
Has Mr. Smith finished yet?

50
00:04:32,804 --> 00:04:34,304
He's having his dessert in his room.

51
00:04:34,305 --> 00:04:35,905
Dessert in his room, eh?

52
00:04:35,906 --> 00:04:37,906
Thank heaven I got home before 8 o'clock.

53
00:04:37,907 --> 00:04:40,407
Yes, mam.
Just a minute, Andrews. I'll take this.

54
00:04:40,408 --> 00:04:42,208
It's a new phonograph record.

55
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:44,809
We must not let him grow tired of the other one.

56
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,000
No, mam. A man can't be reminded too much of anything.

57
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:49,501
Even a wife.

58
00:04:59,602 --> 00:05:01,302
Dessert in his room, eh?

59
00:05:01,303 --> 00:05:03,903
Pardon me, were you looking for someone?

60
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,604
Certainly not for you.

61
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:10,105
I had no idea that Mr. Smith was entertaining
lady friends.

62
00:05:10,106 --> 00:05:13,606
Well, I'd hardly say I'd gotten that far.

63
00:05:20,807 --> 00:05:23,707
I'm only here on trial.
Trial?

64
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:28,208
Yes, he promised that if I made good today,
he'd keep me.

65
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:31,309
Keep you?

66
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:35,210
Oh... Oh, I see.

67
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:39,011
You're the new secretary.
Well, of course. What did you think?

68
00:05:39,012 --> 00:05:41,412
If you knew my son-in-law as I know him

69
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:43,713
you wouldn't blame me for having misjudged you.

70
00:05:43,714 --> 00:05:47,414
You don't mean he's a passion flower.
No, he's no geranium.

71
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:53,015
And if you're wise, you won't stay here another minute.

72
00:05:54,716 --> 00:05:56,716
I don't mind. I get paid double for it.

73
00:05:56,717 --> 00:05:59,517
Nothing could pay you for what might happen.

74
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:03,318
You're not at all the sort of young woman
that should be around here after...

75
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,919
8 o'clock.

76
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,120
You'd be surprised.

77
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:08,521
Andrew!

78
00:06:09,922 --> 00:06:11,222
Andrew!

79
00:06:11,523 --> 00:06:14,423
Where in the name of... Andrew!

80
00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:16,524
Yes, yes, sir?

81
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:19,925
The top drawer of my writing the cabinet is all broken,
all my important the papers all over the floor.

82
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:21,726
Pick them up at once. At once!
Yes, sir.

83
00:06:25,627 --> 00:06:27,727
Miss Minter, you have those papers ready
for my signature?

84
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:29,728
Not yet, Mr. Smith.
You see, your mother-in-law...

85
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:31,629
Oh, hang my mother-in-law.

86
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,030
Yes, sir...
Uh?

87
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:37,731
Oh, hello, mother.

88
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:41,432
Oh, mother, pardon my English.
I thought you were in Newark.

89
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:43,333
Sorry to disappoint you.

90
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:46,534
But Richard, if you're not too busy,
I would like just a word with you.

91
00:06:46,535 --> 00:06:48,535
One word? Why that's unusual. What is it?

92
00:06:48,536 --> 00:06:51,536
I want to see you alone.
Well, that's impossible at the present moment, mother.

93
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:54,537
Impossible!
But Richard, I have something very important to tell you.

94
00:06:54,538 --> 00:06:57,338
Miss Minter, please, what did you do with the papers
on the Randall murder case?

95
00:06:57,339 --> 00:06:59,739
Richard, I have a surprise for you.

96
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,440
Oh, you're going home? Splendid...
Oh, I'm sorry... Mother, please!

97
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:05,041
Can't you see that I'm busy with Miss Minter?

98
00:07:05,042 --> 00:07:06,842
Miss Minter, busy, please.
Busy, busy, busy.

99
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,743
Humph! Busy!

100
00:07:08,744 --> 00:07:10,944
Mother, your suspicions hurt me.

101
00:07:10,945 --> 00:07:12,945
Now what possible objection can you have
to Miss Minter?

102
00:07:12,946 --> 00:07:15,246
Well, I don't like her wiggle.
Her what?

103
00:07:15,247 --> 00:07:18,007
Her wiggle, her walk.
Oh, I hadn't noticed it.

104
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:20,108
Miss Minter, wiggle.
Err, that is, walk, please.

105
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:26,909
Oh... that'll do.

106
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:29,210
Never do that again during business hours.
Never!

107
00:07:31,511 --> 00:07:33,011
Now, come mother, come.

108
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:38,012
Run along like a good little girl and I promise you
the only thing she'll wiggle is her Corona.

109
00:07:39,713 --> 00:07:42,313
But Richard, now we must have our talk.

110
00:07:42,314 --> 00:07:44,614
You'll send for me when she leaves?

111
00:07:44,615 --> 00:07:48,415
I will, mother, I will, if you promise not to come
until I send for you.

112
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:52,216
All right, Richard, dear.
Remember, I trust you.

113
00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:55,217
Since when.

114
00:07:59,318 --> 00:08:00,918
Now, Miss Minter, where were we?

115
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:04,219
I err... Ah, yes, yes.

116
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,020
Oh, yes... hmm...

117
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:08,921
Remarkable speech of Richard Smith
in the Randall murder case.

118
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,922
Hmm...The eminent lawyer... hmm...

119
00:08:12,723 --> 00:08:15,323
Oh, my word!
Why that's a picture of me.

120
00:08:17,024 --> 00:08:20,324
Why, you couldn't tell me from the murderer.
You know I could sue a firm like this.

121
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:21,925
Sue them for libel.

122
00:08:21,926 --> 00:08:25,126
Come, come, come... to work.
Dictation.

123
00:08:25,127 --> 00:08:26,427
Take a letter.

124
00:08:26,428 --> 00:08:27,828
Are you ready?
Shoot.

125
00:08:27,829 --> 00:08:28,829
I...

126
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,530
Dignity, please, Miss Minter, during office hours.

127
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:33,831
I'll try it again.
Are you ready?

128
00:08:33,832 --> 00:08:35,732
Yes, Mr. Smith.
That's better.

129
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,133
Mr. George Spellbin, Elizabethtown, New York,
Dear Sir.

130
00:08:39,134 --> 00:08:40,634
Got that?
Just a minute.

131
00:08:40,635 --> 00:08:43,235
Miss Minter, what is the matter?
Mr. Smith!

132
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:46,536
Mr. George Spellbin was the name, Elizabethtown, New York,
Dear Sir.

133
00:08:47,737 --> 00:08:53,237
I'm in receipt of your proposition offering me $1,000
to assist you in defense of your client

134
00:08:53,238 --> 00:08:56,838
accused of uh... of uh...
Dear me, what was that accusation?

135
00:08:56,839 --> 00:08:58,739
Murder... don't tell me!

136
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:05,140
Your suggestion that two weeks in the country
would be almost a vacation...

137
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:06,641
Period.

138
00:09:06,642 --> 00:09:10,142
We'll make the fee $2,000 and cut the vacation.

139
00:09:11,143 --> 00:09:14,043
Gleaming lakes and rose gardens do not appeal to me.

140
00:09:14,044 --> 00:09:18,644
As I am a businessman, strictly business.
Strictly business.

141
00:09:30,045 --> 00:09:32,345
Gleaming lakes.

142
00:09:33,046 --> 00:09:34,846
And rose gardens.

143
00:09:36,347 --> 00:09:38,747
It's a pretty thought.

144
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:42,948
Pretty flower.

145
00:09:47,449 --> 00:09:49,849
That letter can wait, Miss Minter.
Take a note.

146
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,450
Miss Lucille Darling, Vanderbilt Hotel, New York City.

147
00:09:54,451 --> 00:09:56,351
Have you got that?
Just a minute.

148
00:09:56,352 --> 00:09:58,752
Take your time, Miss Minter, take your time.

149
00:10:00,653 --> 00:10:02,053
My dear Miss Darling.

150
00:10:03,054 --> 00:10:08,454
I called at your apartment last Tuesday night
four times between the hours of 8 and 12.

151
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:11,855
When you make an appointment with me
you should not fool me.

152
00:10:12,756 --> 00:10:16,056
Will you please return my blue silk pajamas

153
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:17,957
Mr. Smith!

154
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,258
...which I loaned you for the Arts Students' Ball.

155
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:30,259
Very disrespectfully, Richard...
But you know my name, Miss Minter.

156
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,560
I don't have to tell you.

157
00:10:32,861 --> 00:10:34,261
We'll call it a day, shall we?

158
00:10:35,162 --> 00:10:36,662
It's been a very hard day, too.

159
00:10:36,663 --> 00:10:40,063
I wonder, do you feel like a cordial?
Very cordial.

160
00:10:40,064 --> 00:10:43,264
Oh, you little wisecracker.

161
00:10:43,265 --> 00:10:44,965
You may wiggle for me, if you like.

162
00:10:51,566 --> 00:10:52,866
Yes, that'll do.

163
00:10:52,867 --> 00:10:56,967
Mother was right. A very dangerous woman.

164
00:10:58,368 --> 00:11:00,068
Doubly dangerous.

165
00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:01,269
Andrews!

166
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,470
Oh, Andrews.

167
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:10,771
Andrews, bring a cordial, will you, please?

168
00:11:10,772 --> 00:11:13,372
Sorry, sir. But there's not a drink in the house.

169
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:15,173
Mrs. Mantel's orders, sir.

170
00:11:16,474 --> 00:11:18,074
Oh, how stupid.

171
00:11:18,075 --> 00:11:21,275
But you weren't thirsty anyway, were you?
No.

172
00:11:21,276 --> 00:11:24,476
But she didn't say anything about nothing being
on the hip.

173
00:11:26,077 --> 00:11:27,577
Good old Andrews.

174
00:11:27,578 --> 00:11:30,578
Andrews is a perfect container.

175
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:32,279
I mean, retainer.

176
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,280
Bring some glasses, will you, Andrews?
Yes, sir.

177
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:38,581
Well, you said you'd give me a day's trial.

178
00:11:38,982 --> 00:11:43,182
How do you like my work?
A little rough. But sincere.

179
00:11:43,183 --> 00:11:45,483
You consider yourself engaged.
Thank you.

180
00:11:46,984 --> 00:11:48,184
Thank you, thank you.

181
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:52,885
You're quite sure that this is fit for a lady?
That'll fit anybody, sir.

182
00:11:52,986 --> 00:11:54,486
Say no more.

183
00:11:54,487 --> 00:11:56,887
Will you want me anymore this evening, sir?

184
00:11:58,088 --> 00:11:59,288
Not this evening.

185
00:11:59,989 --> 00:12:02,389
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

186
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:07,490
Loose moments.

187
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:16,681
You know, Ms. Minter, all great men
must have their moments of relaxation.

188
00:12:16,682 --> 00:12:18,482
The greater the man, the greater the moments.

189
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,283
Are you suggesting anything?

190
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:22,484
Anything.

191
00:12:28,185 --> 00:12:30,985
Do you like dancing?
I love dancing.

192
00:12:30,986 --> 00:12:32,486
Is that so?

193
00:12:36,387 --> 00:12:37,687
Loose moments.

194
00:13:26,788 --> 00:13:30,388
What have you got on tonight?
Nothing I can't get out of, why?

195
00:13:33,989 --> 00:13:37,189
You know, you, and I, and Jessie James
were just made for each other.

196
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,690
Oh, really?
Yes.

197
00:13:38,691 --> 00:13:42,391
I wonder, I wonder, will you meet me tonight at 10?
Ten? Where?

198
00:13:42,392 --> 00:13:45,192
The Lounge in the Hotel Astor.
We'll have a little supper, we'll have a little dance...

199
00:13:45,193 --> 00:13:49,393
Oh, you have a pretty mouth.
Oh, I like your moustache.

200
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:51,394
Really? Well, shall we introduce them?

201
00:13:59,795 --> 00:14:03,195
Oh, mother, I see you have on your rubber heels again.

202
00:14:04,296 --> 00:14:07,896
Miss Minter just met with a serious accident.
Here, Miss Minter.

203
00:14:07,897 --> 00:14:10,197
These things are very painful, but they must be endured.

204
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:13,998
There. Are you feeling better?
Yes.

205
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:15,199
So am I...

206
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,800
Miss Minter was just leaving.
Yes, thank you.

207
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:21,500
Will you need me tomorrow, Mr. Smith?
At ten. (Ten at the Astor).

208
00:14:21,501 --> 00:14:25,401
What was that, Richard?
Hm? Oh, I said 10 o'clock.

209
00:14:25,402 --> 00:14:27,202
You said Astor.
Did I?

210
00:14:27,203 --> 00:14:29,403
Yes, I "asked her" to come at 10.

211
00:14:29,404 --> 00:14:33,404
Well I wish you good night.

212
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:35,905
Oh, a very, very, very good night.

213
00:14:44,606 --> 00:14:48,206
Richard, I want to talk to you about something
of great importance.

214
00:14:48,207 --> 00:14:50,707
Oh, this is an outrage!

215
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:53,708
The idea of leaving important letters like this
lying around on my desk.

216
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:55,209
Andrews!
What has happened?

217
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:59,110
Oh, I told you, you know I told you...
Look! Now look, it's happened.

218
00:14:59,111 --> 00:15:01,511
Where are you going?
I'm going downtown on business.

219
00:15:01,512 --> 00:15:05,100
Andrews, my hat, my stick...
You are not going out of this house tonight!

220
00:15:05,101 --> 00:15:07,901
I have to, mother, you don't understand.
This is a matter of life or death.

221
00:15:07,902 --> 00:15:10,202
Andrews, if anybody telephones to me,
you tell them that I've gone.

222
00:15:10,203 --> 00:15:11,403
Yes, sir.
He won't!

223
00:15:11,404 --> 00:15:13,504
You haven't gone!

224
00:15:19,705 --> 00:15:22,405
Mother, would you stoop to do a thing like that?

225
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,806
I'd do anything to keep you from going out.

226
00:15:26,807 --> 00:15:29,607
You don't seem to understand. This is from Mrs. Roach.
Mrs. Cockward Roach.

227
00:15:29,608 --> 00:15:33,508
I don't care what kind of a roach she is.
But I'm handling all her private affairs.

228
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:36,600
You can do it in the daytime, not at night.
Her husband has threatened to shoot her.

229
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:38,601
And if he does that, I'll probably lose my fee.

230
00:15:38,602 --> 00:15:41,102
If you go, you will probably lose your life.

231
00:15:41,103 --> 00:15:43,303
Let me see that note.
Never!

232
00:15:43,304 --> 00:15:45,604
This is private.
You mean it's an alibi.

233
00:15:45,605 --> 00:15:48,505
Andrews, take Mr. Smith's hat and stick.

234
00:15:51,206 --> 00:15:53,106
Now, Richard Smith, sit down!

235
00:15:55,507 --> 00:15:57,307
And you listen to me.

236
00:16:00,908 --> 00:16:02,808
You know I'm fond of you.

237
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:05,309
Well, anybody can see that, mother.

238
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:07,910
And you promised Madeline as long as she was away

239
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:11,811
that you'd conduct your business here and never go out at night.
A lawyer's life...

240
00:16:11,112 --> 00:16:16,212
You'd be the first one to regret it if you broke your promise to her.
...and a doctor's life...

241
00:16:16,213 --> 00:16:18,913
And you did it because you know how weak you are...

242
00:16:18,914 --> 00:16:20,314
after 8 o'clock.

243
00:16:20,315 --> 00:16:24,415
The public demands of a certain...
You wanted her to have a happy, contented holiday.

244
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:28,016
I certainly did.
That's the reason you're not going out tonight.

245
00:16:28,017 --> 00:16:32,517
Oh, I'm not going out?
Not as long as I'm here to prevent it.

246
00:16:32,518 --> 00:16:35,018
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.

247
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:38,719
Well, in that case, mother, you win.
With a couple of pounds to spare.

248
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,720
Richard...

249
00:16:42,621 --> 00:16:47,121
I daresay you'll think I'm a very foolish old woman.
Oh, no, mother, no.

250
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:50,222
Not old, a little foolish, perhaps, but not old.

251
00:16:50,223 --> 00:16:51,823
Thank you.

252
00:16:52,724 --> 00:16:54,424
I bought you a little present today.

253
00:16:54,425 --> 00:16:56,425
You bought something? For me?
Hm-hmm.

254
00:16:56,426 --> 00:16:58,826
Well, the idea.

255
00:16:58,827 --> 00:17:00,827
Well, what was it?
Guess.

256
00:17:00,828 --> 00:17:02,928
Is it animal, vegetable, or mineral?

257
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:05,129
Just a little reminder.

258
00:17:05,330 --> 00:17:08,230
It'll make a wonderful companion piece to old Madeline.

259
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:10,531
Baby Feet.

260
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:16,732
Baby's footsteps on the stairs
Baby's footsteps on the stairs

261
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:22,333
I hear them now, those little feet

262
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:26,234
pitter-patter, pitter-patter on the stairs.

263
00:17:27,635 --> 00:17:28,735
Oh, ma.

264
00:17:28,736 --> 00:17:32,436
Yes, Ricky, that's my secret ambition.

265
00:17:32,437 --> 00:17:35,237
To hear the pitter-patter of little feet.

266
00:17:35,238 --> 00:17:39,238
Oh, Ma.
Oh, Richard.

267
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:43,739
Richard, you're now independently successful
and there's no further need of economy.

268
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,140
And I...
Now, Mother, don't flatter me.

269
00:17:47,141 --> 00:17:52,641
Oh, Richard.
I must hear the pitter-patter off little feet.

270
00:17:52,642 --> 00:17:54,442
All right, mother. I'll make a note of it.

271
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:01,043
And tonight, I don't care what happens
to Mrs. Cockward Roach.

272
00:18:01,044 --> 00:18:03,244
Andrews! Andrews...

273
00:18:04,445 --> 00:18:06,245
Oh, you see that, Mother, my voice is gone again.

274
00:18:06,246 --> 00:18:10,846
I've been talking altogether too much.
Oh, I'm so sorry. Is there something I can do?

275
00:18:10,847 --> 00:18:14,747
No, just let me stay here quietly, alone,
and rest all by myself.

276
00:18:14,748 --> 00:18:17,048
Andrews, my dressing gown.
Yes, sir.

277
00:18:17,049 --> 00:18:19,549
Now, Mother, doesn't that prove to you
that I can be trusted?

278
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:22,350
I do trust you, Richard.
I do!

279
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,651
Good night, Mother.

280
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:26,900
And I'm going to look in on you every now and then
to remind you of it.

281
00:18:26,901 --> 00:18:31,401
Yes, you look in and I'll look out.
Good night, good night.

282
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:35,002
And I have a surprise for you, a little later on.
That's splendid.

283
00:18:35,003 --> 00:18:36,803
Good night, Mother.

284
00:18:36,804 --> 00:18:38,304
Why, I have a notion to tell you what it is.

285
00:18:38,305 --> 00:18:40,205
But if you tell me it won't be a surprise.

286
00:18:42,106 --> 00:18:44,706
Oh, you dear ridiculous boy.

287
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,107
I'm so glad you're in a good humor tonight.

288
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:50,408
I'm so happy.

289
00:18:52,009 --> 00:18:55,309
Pitter-patter, pitter-patter, pitter-patter...

290
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:06,010
What... Could you close your mouth long enough
to tell me what you're waiting for?

291
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,711
Yes, sir. I didn't know what to tell you
in front of Mrs. Mantel, sir.

292
00:19:09,712 --> 00:19:12,212
But there's a young lady waiting to see you.

293
00:19:12,213 --> 00:19:14,113
A young lady?
Yes, sir.

294
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:16,114
To see me?
Yes, sir.

295
00:19:16,115 --> 00:19:20,815
What kind of young lady?
Well sir, I should say a very impressive young lady.

296
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:27,216
Blond hair, blue eyes...
Five-foot-two, 106...

297
00:19:27,217 --> 00:19:30,317
And all around 34 with...
That'll do.

298
00:19:30,318 --> 00:19:32,918
If I want to know anything more
about the young lady...

299
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:34,919
I'll find it out for myself.

300
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,820
What does all the round 34, what does she want?

301
00:19:38,021 --> 00:19:41,121
Business, sir. She was sent by a mutual friend.

302
00:19:41,122 --> 00:19:43,722
You know as well as I do that this long after-business hour...

303
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,623
And besides my voice is gone again.
I won't. I won't see anybody.

304
00:19:47,624 --> 00:19:51,124
I know, Mr. Smith, but I couldn't come any other time.

305
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,925
Can't you see me?

306
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,026
Why, who said I couldn't see you?

307
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:04,427
That will do, Andrews.

308
00:20:04,428 --> 00:20:07,528
Yes, sir. I thought it would, sir.

309
00:20:12,729 --> 00:20:15,029
Pardon me, but haven't I seen you somewhere?

310
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,230
Well, that depends. I may not have been there.

311
00:20:17,231 --> 00:20:20,431
Oh, yes... I see that one.

312
00:20:21,132 --> 00:20:24,432
But I know your face.
I'm sure that we must have met.

313
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,433
Well, I...
Now, now, now, don't tell me.

314
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,134
I'll get you in just a minute, yes...

315
00:20:28,135 --> 00:20:30,635
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.

316
00:20:32,736 --> 00:20:34,536
Oh, I'll get you yet.

317
00:20:35,037 --> 00:20:37,137
I know your face...

318
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:41,238
No! Why, it's Miss O'Dare.
Yes!

319
00:20:41,239 --> 00:20:44,639
Diane O'Dare.
My favorite screen actress.

320
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,240
Really? How nice.
My, I feel that we should be very, very good friends.

321
00:20:48,241 --> 00:20:49,741
I've seen so much of you.

322
00:20:49,742 --> 00:20:50,942
What?

323
00:20:50,943 --> 00:20:53,143
I mean, I've seen you so often.

324
00:20:53,144 --> 00:20:55,044
Oh...

325
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:59,445
I'm afraid you're making fun of me.
Not at all, not at all.

326
00:20:59,446 --> 00:21:01,446
Diane O'Dare.

327
00:21:01,447 --> 00:21:04,947
Well, what can I do to you... for you, Miss O'Dare?

328
00:21:04,948 --> 00:21:08,248
Andrews, the man, he said something about a mutual friend.

329
00:21:08,249 --> 00:21:12,049
Yes, your new secretary, Kitty Minter advised me
to come and see you.

330
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,650
Oh, you're a friend of Miss Minter's.
Yes.

331
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:20,751
Oh, well...
And, oh, Mr. Smith, I think you're a perfectly wonderful man.

332
00:21:20,752 --> 00:21:23,152
Really?
Hm-hmm. I mean, in your business.

333
00:21:23,153 --> 00:21:27,453
Oh...
Everyone's talking about the wonderful speech
you made in the Randall murder case.

334
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,054
Oh, they're talking about it, are they?
Yes.

335
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:34,055
What about Lonely Wives?
Yes, it was very good.

336
00:21:34,056 --> 00:21:36,356
That came right from the heart.

337
00:21:36,357 --> 00:21:38,457
And that's why I came.
Yes?

338
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:43,458
Of course, you're a murder lawyer, aren't you?
Yes, I specialize in murders.

339
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:50,000
You haven't murdered anyone, have you?
Well, no, not yet. That is, I...

340
00:21:50,001 --> 00:21:53,960
Well, of course I don't believe I could be very much assistance,
you see, until after the crime is committed.

341
00:21:55,161 --> 00:21:59,661
I only thought, on account of your feeling
for lonely wives....

342
00:21:59,662 --> 00:22:02,462
Yes?
You might get me a divorce from my husband.

343
00:22:03,563 --> 00:22:05,063
A husband?
Uh-huh.

344
00:22:05,064 --> 00:22:07,004
A husband?
Yes.

345
00:22:07,005 --> 00:22:09,105
That's different.

346
00:22:12,106 --> 00:22:13,806
Well, as a matter of fact, Miss O'Dare...

347
00:22:13,807 --> 00:22:17,507
I thoroughly and strongly disapprove of divorce.

348
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:19,608
My specialty is murders.

349
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:23,309
Oh, but this would be such a little one.
No, no.

350
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:26,410
Just a nice, quiet, sweet little divorce.

351
00:22:26,411 --> 00:22:30,711
You do not realize that modern civilization
is founded on err...

352
00:22:32,512 --> 00:22:34,412
the unity, the...

353
00:22:38,113 --> 00:22:41,413
Those eyes...
I don't suppose you mean that.

354
00:22:41,414 --> 00:22:46,614
Mean what, Mr. Smith?
That err... that "come and get me" expression in them.

355
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,415
I don't know what you're talking about.

356
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:51,816
What a pity!

357
00:22:52,517 --> 00:22:55,417
You know I can hardly believe that you're married.

358
00:22:55,418 --> 00:22:57,418
Well, I'm not very much.

359
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:59,619
That's why I want the divorce.

360
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,820
Your husband is giving you trouble?

361
00:23:01,821 --> 00:23:03,821
He's not giving me anything.

362
00:23:03,822 --> 00:23:05,222
He's an actor.

363
00:23:05,823 --> 00:23:07,023
A bad actor?

364
00:23:07,024 --> 00:23:09,924
Not exactly. He's really quite good...

365
00:23:09,925 --> 00:23:13,525
...on the stage.
Oh, what an alibi to get out every night.

366
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:15,626
I don't mind Felix going out.

367
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,827
The trouble is that he doesn't come in.

368
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:20,228
You mean to say that he leaves you all alone
all night?

369
00:23:20,229 --> 00:23:22,529
Every night?
Well, no, not every night.

370
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,230
And I can't stand the uncertainty.

371
00:23:25,231 --> 00:23:30,031
I'd be so much happier if he'd always come home
when he's through at the theater.

372
00:23:30,032 --> 00:23:33,932
Or if I could depend on his staying out.

373
00:23:36,933 --> 00:23:39,333
You poor little woman.

374
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:42,234
I'll see what I can do.
Oh...

375
00:23:42,435 --> 00:23:44,735
Do you like dancing?
Oh, I love it.

376
00:23:44,736 --> 00:23:45,836
You love it?
Hm-hmm!

377
00:23:54,137 --> 00:23:57,137
But wouldn't we be rather crowded dancing in here?

378
00:23:57,138 --> 00:23:58,538
Well, err...

379
00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:00,939
Oh, that's not a bad idea.

380
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,340
Why couldn't we adjourn to the Whoopie Club?
Now?

381
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:08,241
You know, you and I and Jessie James
were just made for each other.

382
00:24:08,242 --> 00:24:11,742
Oh, I couldn't. My husband's terribly jealous.

383
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:17,443
He is? And yet he leaves you alone and lonely?
Oh, well, that's just like a man.

384
00:24:17,444 --> 00:24:18,844
You know, Miss O'Dare?

385
00:24:18,845 --> 00:24:23,145
Your friend, Miss Minter and I, we have a little extra business
we're going to transact

386
00:24:23,146 --> 00:24:25,746
and we're going to conference at the Astor at 10 o'clock.

387
00:24:25,747 --> 00:24:28,047
Why couldn't we all get together and have a little supper?

388
00:24:28,048 --> 00:24:31,048
But wouldn't you be embarrassed with two girls?

389
00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:34,349
Two? And me feeling positively Oriental?

390
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,050
But I came to you for a divorce, not a party.

391
00:24:38,051 --> 00:24:41,351
Well, of course, Miss O'Dare, if you cannot consider yourself
a party of the first party...

392
00:24:41,352 --> 00:24:44,152
What is it, Andrews?
The front doorbell, sir.

393
00:24:44,153 --> 00:24:45,353
Well, see who it is.

394
00:24:45,354 --> 00:24:49,154
You might be interested to know, sir, that Mrs. Mantel
is coming down the back stairs.

395
00:24:51,255 --> 00:24:54,555
She might not understand our business relations.
Well, I'll go.

396
00:24:54,556 --> 00:24:58,956
That way. A little more difficult, but much safer.
Oh.

397
00:25:03,657 --> 00:25:07,157
And you won't forget. Ten at the Astor
and we'll discuss your divorce case.

398
00:25:07,158 --> 00:25:10,158
You don't think I'll be doing wrong?
Time will tell.

399
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,059
Time will tell.

400
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,660
Just take a seat, sir. I'll tell him.

401
00:25:20,211 --> 00:25:21,861
Gentleman to see you, sir.

402
00:25:24,462 --> 00:25:26,062
"The Great Zero"!

403
00:25:26,063 --> 00:25:27,763
Meaning nothing.

404
00:25:27,764 --> 00:25:30,464
He said your secretary made an appointment, sir.

405
00:25:30,465 --> 00:25:34,365
Oh, yes, yes. By all means.
Have him come right in.

406
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:37,166
Yes, sir.
He might be a good excuse for my getting out.

407
00:25:38,767 --> 00:25:40,167
This way, sir.

408
00:25:46,468 --> 00:25:47,668
Thank you.

409
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:51,169
Oh, hello, Mr. Smith.

410
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:56,470
You understand of course this is long after business hours.
I can give you only five minutes.

411
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,671
Thank you. Mr. Smith, you are a very famous lawyer.

412
00:25:59,672 --> 00:26:02,472
Oh, well, possibly ten minutes.

413
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:04,173
Would you sit down?
Thank you.

414
00:26:04,174 --> 00:26:06,774
I am a vaudeville impersonator, sir.

415
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:10,575
I impersonate all the great men, Julius Cesar,
William Jennings Brian...

416
00:26:10,576 --> 00:26:13,476
Oh, all the dead ones.
I do the live ones too, sir.

417
00:26:13,477 --> 00:26:16,577
Yes, I know. I saw your act in the theater.
You're really quite good.

418
00:26:16,578 --> 00:26:17,978
Oh, thank you, thank you.

419
00:26:17,979 --> 00:26:20,579
Your jury speeches, sir, have made you famous.

420
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,380
I'm opening my new act at the Palace next week
and I depict you as the man of the moment.

421
00:26:24,381 --> 00:26:26,081
May I impersonate you?

422
00:26:27,682 --> 00:26:29,482
You impersonate me?

423
00:26:29,483 --> 00:26:30,983
Why, how could you?

424
00:26:31,184 --> 00:26:34,784
Oh, as a matter of fact, yes, I do think
you look a little bit like me.

425
00:26:34,785 --> 00:26:37,385
Oh, but I flatter you there, of course.

426
00:26:37,386 --> 00:26:41,386
But my dear sir.
Mr. Smith, I could get your face in two minutes.

427
00:26:41,387 --> 00:26:44,187
You can do in two minutes what has taken me
all my life to do?

428
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:45,888
Hm-hmm. May I show you?

429
00:26:45,889 --> 00:26:47,289
You'll have to.

430
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:52,990
May I... would it make you nervous
if I watch the operation?

431
00:26:52,991 --> 00:26:57,591
Two thousand people watch me every night.
You have an inferiority complex, haven't you?

432
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:04,692
Oh, very good. Make a few gestures.
I'd like to study your tricks of.., expression, your mannerisms.

433
00:27:04,693 --> 00:27:06,193
Smile, please.

434
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:09,094
Frown.

435
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,795
Register grief.

436
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,896
Grief? Well, how do you grieve?

437
00:27:18,797 --> 00:27:19,897
Splendid.

438
00:27:19,898 --> 00:27:22,798
Resignation.

439
00:27:23,499 --> 00:27:24,699
Anger.

440
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,900
Very good.
I feel like a perfect fool.

441
00:27:27,901 --> 00:27:29,001
Very good.

442
00:27:30,002 --> 00:27:33,602
You make this very snappy, won't you.
I have some very heavy thinking to do before 10 o'clock.

443
00:27:35,803 --> 00:27:37,303
Have you a mother-in-law?

444
00:27:37,304 --> 00:27:39,604
No. My wife is an orphan.

445
00:27:39,605 --> 00:27:43,405
Oh, lucky boy. Not that I want to say anything
against my mother-in-law.

446
00:27:43,406 --> 00:27:46,206
She's e very sweet old lady and very, very fond of me.

447
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:50,507
Only she works too hard at it.
Oh, tries to run you out of your own home, I suppose.

448
00:27:50,508 --> 00:27:52,308
No, tries to keep me in it.

449
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:55,509
Tonight, for instance.
I have a date at ten with a lady.

450
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:57,110
With two ladies.

451
00:27:57,111 --> 00:27:58,911
Two ladies? What for?

452
00:27:58,912 --> 00:28:03,012
Well, I don't know just what for...
Of course, I have an idea. But I don't know.

453
00:28:03,013 --> 00:28:06,500
One of them is married.
Hm, her husband must be a sap.

454
00:28:10,601 --> 00:28:12,401
Minty, are you decent?

455
00:28:12,402 --> 00:28:14,002
No. Come in.

456
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:17,903
Hello.
Hi, where have you been?

457
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,504
Oh, say, did you go to see Smith?

458
00:28:19,505 --> 00:28:23,505
Hmm... I went, I saw
and I made a date to meet him tonight.

459
00:28:23,806 --> 00:28:27,106
Say, that guy must be blooming all over the place.

460
00:28:27,107 --> 00:28:29,207
He made a date with me for tonight, too.

461
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,708
Yeah, I know all about it.

462
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,709
That's why I agreed to go.
Oh, yeah?

463
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:36,010
Which one of us were you trying to protect?

464
00:28:36,311 --> 00:28:38,611
That was the only way I could get him
to take my case.

465
00:28:38,612 --> 00:28:41,712
Oh, that's all right, darling.
And I'll give you every break in the world.

466
00:28:41,713 --> 00:28:44,813
I know.
Say, you'd better go over to your apartment and get dressed,
hadn't you?

467
00:28:44,999 --> 00:28:47,954
I only hope I get there before Felix does.

468
00:28:47,955 --> 00:28:51,855
Oh, why worry about Zero?
You're gonna get a divorce from him, aren't you?

469
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:54,356
Yeah, but I don't want him to divorce me.

470
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,157
Oh!
Bye.

471
00:28:56,158 --> 00:28:57,158
Bye.

472
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:04,059
Pardon me, have you an extra pair of glasses?

473
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,660
I should have somewhere.

474
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:07,761
No, come to think of it, I broke mine.

475
00:29:07,762 --> 00:29:09,162
Here, take these.

476
00:29:09,363 --> 00:29:10,563
Thanks.

477
00:29:15,564 --> 00:29:18,064
Well? How about it?

478
00:29:22,165 --> 00:29:23,465
Well, I'll...

479
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:25,166
Why, I...

480
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:28,867
Well, I'll be a son of a gun!

481
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:32,268
Richard Smith and Richard Smith.

482
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:34,169
Uh-Huh.
Why, we could be the Smith Brothers.

483
00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:36,470
Oh, boy. You could fool anybody.

484
00:29:36,471 --> 00:29:38,971
Why, of course I could.
I bet I could fool your own mother.

485
00:29:38,972 --> 00:29:41,372
Yes... fool my mother?

486
00:29:41,973 --> 00:29:44,073
My boy, heaven has sent you to me.

487
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:46,774
You want my permission to do this impersonation
of me in public?

488
00:29:46,775 --> 00:29:50,075
That's the reason I'm here.
Well, you stay here tonight, in my place...

489
00:29:50,076 --> 00:29:53,376
and if you can fool my mother-in-law and the servants
until I get back...

490
00:29:53,377 --> 00:29:55,177
I'll give you that permission.

491
00:29:55,178 --> 00:29:57,478
It's a bet.
You're on, and I'm off.

492
00:29:58,979 --> 00:30:00,879
You seem to have a frog in your throat.

493
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:03,180
At least a dozen of them.
Fine, I could use that.

494
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:04,481
Good, I'll give them to you.

495
00:30:07,782 --> 00:30:09,082
This is my room.

496
00:30:10,783 --> 00:30:12,383
And this is my wife's room.

497
00:30:12,384 --> 00:30:14,684
Your wife?
She isn't here, is she?

498
00:30:14,685 --> 00:30:16,885
You think I'd go away and leave you here
if she were?

499
00:30:18,486 --> 00:30:19,886
She's in the mountains.

500
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:24,687
Now this is a dressing-room and bath
connecting the two rooms.

501
00:30:24,688 --> 00:30:26,888
Oh... they connect.

502
00:30:27,789 --> 00:30:29,489
Sure. We sleep.

503
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:32,290
Where does mother sleep?
Mother?

504
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:34,391
She never sleeps.

505
00:30:44,192 --> 00:30:47,892
Now, my mother-in-law may say something
about having a surprise for you.

506
00:30:47,893 --> 00:30:50,993
That's all right. I'll tell her to wait until morning.

507
00:30:58,494 --> 00:31:00,094
Beg your pardon. Did you ring, sir?

508
00:31:00,095 --> 00:31:04,095
No, no, err... sonny, I did not.

509
00:31:04,896 --> 00:31:06,596
Then it must have been Mrs. Mantel.

510
00:31:07,697 --> 00:31:10,297
Has the gentleman gone, sir?

511
00:31:10,298 --> 00:31:12,298
Who?
The gentleman.

512
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:15,599
Oh, yes. He's gone, yes.

513
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,800
And, uh... will you bring me a drink, please.
Yes, sir.

514
00:31:18,991 --> 00:31:22,801
And tell my mother-in-law that my cold seems to be
so much worse.

515
00:31:22,802 --> 00:31:24,502
I'll probably be getting to bed early.

516
00:31:24,503 --> 00:31:26,003
Yes, sir, yes...

517
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,704
Marvelous! Boy, you're a wonder.

518
00:31:40,705 --> 00:31:44,905
Say, if you can fool my mother-in-law,
I'll pay you 500 dollars.

519
00:31:44,906 --> 00:31:47,906
And I'll make you an offer to retain you regularly.
Huh?

520
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:50,807
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

521
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:54,808
I almost forgot. There you are.
Every little bit helps.

522
00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:57,809
Oh, thanks, You don't miss a trick.

523
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,310
You must have been out before.

524
00:31:59,311 --> 00:32:01,411
Now, are you all set?
Not quite.

525
00:32:01,412 --> 00:32:03,212
I think you better turn down some of the lights.

526
00:32:05,313 --> 00:32:07,713
I don't want to take any chances with mother-in-law.

527
00:32:09,614 --> 00:32:14,114
There you are. The house is yours.
If you want me, you'll find me at the Hotel Astor.

528
00:32:14,115 --> 00:32:15,915
Bye-Bye.
Hey, wait.

529
00:32:15,916 --> 00:32:18,216
What do you call your mother-in-law?

530
00:32:18,217 --> 00:32:22,317
Oh, everything. You'll be perfectly safe
if you stick to "mother".

531
00:32:22,318 --> 00:32:24,518
Well, my loose moment's calling.

532
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:25,519
Ta-ta.

533
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,820
Richard! Richard!

534
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:20,421
Oh, Richard...
Oh, here you are.

535
00:33:20,422 --> 00:33:22,422
You know, I got such a start.

536
00:33:22,423 --> 00:33:24,423
I thought I heard the front door slam.

537
00:33:24,424 --> 00:33:26,824
Yes, my call, I just left.

538
00:33:26,825 --> 00:33:29,625
Well, now we can continue our little session.

539
00:33:29,626 --> 00:33:31,956
I'm sorry, mother-in-law. You'll have to excuse me.
I'm very busy.

540
00:33:31,957 --> 00:33:33,957
Where are you going?
I'm going to bed.

541
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:36,058
But you mustn't!
Mustn't go to bed?

542
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:40,059
Not before you get your little surprise.
Sorry, mother-in-law, you'll have to keep it until the morning.

543
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,160
Oh, Richard, you're so stupid!
Madeline.

544
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:45,161
Your wife is home again.

545
00:33:49,262 --> 00:33:50,462
My wife?

546
00:33:56,963 --> 00:34:00,363
Well, he was...
Maybe he's in the room.

547
00:34:06,264 --> 00:34:08,264
He's tried to fool you.

548
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,765
Dickie, dear, aren't you surprised?
I'm paralyzed.

549
00:34:15,266 --> 00:34:18,966
You can see how dumbfounded he is, dear.
He hasn't even kissed you yet.

550
00:34:18,967 --> 00:34:22,867
Yes! Where is that great big homecoming kiss
you've been writing me to expect?

551
00:34:22,868 --> 00:34:24,468
The great big homecoming kiss?
Hmm...

552
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:26,269
The one I was writing you about?
Hmm...

553
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:30,870
Oh, I'm saving it till...
Oh, you silly puffy goose...

554
00:34:30,871 --> 00:34:32,471
I mean, I'm saving it till we uh...

555
00:34:32,472 --> 00:34:34,372
until my cold gets better.

556
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:37,173
Cold? Have you a cold, sweetheart?
It's frightful.

557
00:34:37,174 --> 00:34:38,774
I wouldn't dare kiss you.

558
00:34:38,775 --> 00:34:40,475
Besides, if anyone saw us.

559
00:34:40,476 --> 00:34:42,976
Andrews, leave the room.

560
00:34:45,277 --> 00:34:48,177
Leave the room!
No! Don't anyone dare to leave this room!

561
00:34:48,178 --> 00:34:52,078
And I wouldn't cling so closely, dear.
No, really, in the condition I'm in...

562
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,079
It's dangerous.
Fiddlesticks, I'm not afraid.

563
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,580
That's because you have no idea what's ahead of us.

564
00:34:57,581 --> 00:35:01,281
Has something gone wrong?
Dickie, you're keeping something from me.

565
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:02,082
Mother, turn on the lights at once...

566
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:05,600
No, no, no, don't dare to turn on those lights.
Dickie, what is the matter?

567
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:09,301
Because the new... I mean, my eyes!
All swollen with the cold...

568
00:35:09,302 --> 00:35:11,502
Andrews, get me a stimulant!

569
00:35:12,503 --> 00:35:15,903
Are you in serious trouble, dear?
It's probably fatal.

570
00:35:15,904 --> 00:35:18,904
If I had any idea you were coming home,
I wouldn't have been here.

571
00:35:18,905 --> 00:35:21,605
What?
I mean, in the condition I'm in.

572
00:35:21,606 --> 00:35:23,106
Oh, Dickie.

573
00:35:23,107 --> 00:35:24,707
There's just one thing to be done.

574
00:35:25,608 --> 00:35:26,908
I've got to go!

575
00:35:26,909 --> 00:35:28,209
Go? Where?

576
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:31,310
Out! Downtown!
Downtown now?

577
00:35:31,311 --> 00:35:33,711
Tonight?
Oh, I should have gone ten minutes ago.

578
00:35:33,712 --> 00:35:35,812
An important engagement. Hotel Astor.

579
00:35:35,813 --> 00:35:38,413
Well, if 
I know my precious husband
the way I think I do,

580
00:35:38,414 --> 00:35:41,714
he'll telephone and cancel that engagement, won't you, Dickie?
Telephone, who?

581
00:35:41,715 --> 00:35:43,915
I mean, isn't there a telephone...
A telephone, of course!

582
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:46,116
Of course, you can.
Should I get the Astor on the wire?

583
00:35:46,117 --> 00:35:48,617
Hotel Astor, on the telephone, yes...
Wait, what do you mean?

584
00:35:48,618 --> 00:35:51,018
Any telephoning to be done around here
I'll do it myself.

585
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:56,389
Well, maybe I'll wait... until you get ready to...
until we both get ready to...

586
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:59,190
Well, maybe before that.
I knew you would.

587
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:02,291
You know, I'm simply dying to get comfortable
in my own little bed again

588
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:04,392
and have a nice long talk with you.

589
00:36:04,393 --> 00:36:07,393
There's nothing I'd like better than to sit
on the edge of the bed and listen to you, but...

590
00:36:07,394 --> 00:36:09,194
Oh, how thoughtless of me!

591
00:36:09,195 --> 00:36:11,595
After your long trip, dear, you must be tired.

592
00:36:11,596 --> 00:36:13,296
Oh, I'm not a bit tired, really.

593
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:15,997
Why, the two months in the mountains
have made me a world of good.

594
00:36:15,998 --> 00:36:17,898
Do your telephoning, Richard.

595
00:36:18,899 --> 00:36:21,599
Now, Madeleine, get out of your travelling clothes
and get into something more comfortable.

596
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,700
Yes, it won't take me but a moment.
And, Dickie...

597
00:36:23,701 --> 00:36:27,101
I bought a new lace nightie yesterday
that's positively indecent.

598
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:29,202
Wait till you see it.

599
00:36:41,503 --> 00:36:43,003
Where are you going?
Huh? I don't know.

600
00:36:43,004 --> 00:36:45,104
Oh, I was going down to see
if the front door was locked.

601
00:36:45,105 --> 00:36:49,105
You know Andrews always locks it.
Well I thought tonight he might have forgotten it.

602
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:54,106
Richard Smith, after all you promised Madeline
are you counting to desert her?

603
00:36:54,107 --> 00:36:55,997
Desert her? Why!

604
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,898
First evening home in two months and you...

605
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:02,799
Richard!

606
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,800
Have you no human feelings at all?
That's just the trouble.

607
00:37:06,801 --> 00:37:08,301
I'm too human.

608
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,702
A lovely devoted wife like Madeline.

609
00:37:12,603 --> 00:37:15,403
Surely she's entitled to some consideration.

610
00:37:15,404 --> 00:37:17,704
Well, he's a brother elk.
What was that?

611
00:37:17,705 --> 00:37:20,205
What? Mother, you don't understand.

612
00:37:20,206 --> 00:37:23,506
You see, this sudden return. It's been an awful shock,
an awful shock to my whole system.

613
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:24,807
My throat, my voice...

614
00:37:24,808 --> 00:37:26,108
throat, voice, all gone.

615
00:37:26,709 --> 00:37:28,809
She doesn't want you to sing to her.

616
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:33,410
What she wants more than anything else in the world
is a nice, long talk with you.

617
00:37:34,511 --> 00:37:36,511
Oh, if I could depend on that.

618
00:37:36,512 --> 00:37:38,912
Now, Richard, don't delay your telephoning
another minute.

619
00:37:38,913 --> 00:37:41,413
What telephone?
Oh, telephone... what was the number?

620
00:37:43,914 --> 00:37:45,414
Good night, Madeline, dear.

621
00:37:45,415 --> 00:37:47,315
So glad to have you home again.

622
00:37:47,316 --> 00:37:48,916
Night, Mother, pleasant dreams.

623
00:37:52,217 --> 00:37:53,917
Hello? Hotel Astor?

624
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:00,418
Good night, Richard, dear.
Huh?

625
00:38:00,419 --> 00:38:02,219
Yes, good night.

626
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,920
Hello? Hotel Astor?

627
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:09,821
Will you get Mr. Richard Smith.

628
00:38:09,822 --> 00:38:11,822
Page Mr. Richard Smith, yes.

629
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:14,023
Tell him to telephone his home immediately.

630
00:38:14,024 --> 00:38:16,824
Important? It's vital.

631
00:38:16,925 --> 00:38:18,625
Mr. Richard Smith.

632
00:38:18,626 --> 00:38:20,126
Thank you.

633
00:38:33,827 --> 00:38:35,327
Tired, sweetheart?

634
00:38:35,328 --> 00:38:39,428
Tired? I never was so tired in all my...

635
00:38:44,229 --> 00:38:46,229
Please come out of that doorway, will you?

636
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:52,930
Tell me. Have you been a good boy
since I've been away?

637
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:56,531
I'm in more danger now than I have been
in the past two months.

638
00:38:57,032 --> 00:39:00,632
Please, please go away and let me die,
or go crazy or something.

639
00:39:00,633 --> 00:39:03,600
Go away? Dickie, you're not well.

640
00:39:03,601 --> 00:39:07,234
Don't you suppose I know it? Haven't I been telling you
that for past half hour in those very words?

641
00:39:08,335 --> 00:39:10,735
That telephone didn't ring, did it?
No, dear.

642
00:39:10,736 --> 00:39:15,636
I'm afraid you've been doing too much brain work.
That's it. It's my brain. It's on fire, it's fever.

643
00:39:15,637 --> 00:39:17,337
I can't think.
You can't think?

644
00:39:17,338 --> 00:39:21,438
No... Yes... The only things I can think of
are the things that I shouldn't.

645
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:24,539
That wasn't the telephone bell then, was it?

646
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,540
Dickie, you're trembling all over.
Don't you suppose I know it?

647
00:39:27,541 --> 00:39:29,441
I'm liable to go to pieces any moment.

648
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,842
The telephone isn't out of order, is it?
Oh, bother the old phone!

649
00:39:32,843 --> 00:39:36,543
Thank goodness I have arrived in time to prevent
another nervous breakdown like you had last year.

650
00:39:36,544 --> 00:39:39,944
That's it. Nervous combustion.
I've been trying to keep it from you.

651
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:44,545
Send for an ambulance, quick.
Ambulance nothing, I'm going to take care of you myself.

652
00:39:44,546 --> 00:39:48,146
Now, come on. Now, the first thing to do
is to put you to bed.

653
00:39:49,147 --> 00:39:51,047
That is the last thing.

654
00:39:52,548 --> 00:39:54,148
Now don't argue, dear.

655
00:39:54,149 --> 00:40:00,449
I'm going to give you a nice, old-fashioned alcohol rubdown.
No, no, I couldn't stand it.

656
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:02,350
Come on..
No, no, no, no

657
00:40:02,351 --> 00:40:04,051
Madeline knows best.

658
00:40:04,052 --> 00:40:06,152
Now put your head right down here.

659
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:09,253
There, put your little head right down...
No, no, no... I'm afraid.

660
00:40:09,254 --> 00:40:11,754
You're afraid?
Yes, I'm afraid you might catch my cold.

661
00:40:11,755 --> 00:40:15,255
Oh, bother your old cold. Now, Madeline knows
how to take care of her Dickie bird.

662
00:40:15,256 --> 00:40:21,056
Come on, put you little head right down there.
My poor nervous Dickie boy.

663
00:40:21,857 --> 00:40:24,457
Now, before anything else, sweetheart...

664
00:40:24,458 --> 00:40:27,058
that great big homecoming kiss.

665
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:29,159
Never!
Oh, yes...

666
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,360
Never!
Oh, come on, come on now, dear...

667
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:32,961
Now, come on, now come on...

668
00:40:44,362 --> 00:40:45,462
There!

669
00:40:51,463 --> 00:40:52,463
Too late.

670
00:40:52,564 --> 00:40:55,264
Pitter-patter down the stairs...

671
00:40:55,265 --> 00:40:58,265
Pitter-patter down the stairs...

672
00:40:58,266 --> 00:41:02,266
I hear them coming...

673
00:41:02,267 --> 00:41:05,967
Pitter-patter down the stairs...

674
00:41:05,968 --> 00:41:09,668
Pitter-patter down the stairs...

675
00:41:21,264 --> 00:41:22,264
VoilÃ , madame.

676
00:41:27,565 --> 00:41:31,365
Did you get your call?
No, I guess my mother-in-law must have gone to bed.

677
00:41:31,366 --> 00:41:33,166
Oh, you're married too!

678
00:41:33,167 --> 00:41:37,067
Very happily. That's the reason I so thoroughly
disapprove of divorce.

679
00:41:37,068 --> 00:41:39,668
Especially in this State.
What do you mean?

680
00:41:39,669 --> 00:41:43,369
Well, in order to procure a divorce in this State
you must have evidence.

681
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,370
What kind of evidence?

682
00:41:45,371 --> 00:41:48,671
Well, evidence of a very serious nature.

683
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,372
How serious?

684
00:41:50,373 --> 00:41:56,073
Well, you see, you must produce evidence that
your husband has been uh...

685
00:41:56,074 --> 00:41:57,474
has been uh...

686
00:41:58,375 --> 00:42:01,675
That is to say, you must explain
that you have discovered him...

687
00:42:01,776 --> 00:42:04,276
and not only him, but uh...

688
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,877
I don't know what you mean, Mr. Smith.

689
00:42:09,878 --> 00:42:12,078
You have to get the goods on him.

690
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:15,579
In other words, you have to prove that he has uh...

691
00:42:17,181 --> 00:42:21,881
Where do you come from, Miss O'Dare?
I came from South Dakota.

692
00:42:21,882 --> 00:42:24,582
Oh, I don't blame you.

693
00:42:27,783 --> 00:42:30,383
Well, out in South Dakota don't they ever...

694
00:42:30,384 --> 00:42:31,584
ever uh...

695
00:42:31,585 --> 00:42:33,785
Ever what, Mr. Smith?

696
00:42:33,786 --> 00:42:36,386
No, there's no use of us going to South Dakota.

697
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,887
We may just as well stay here.

698
00:42:40,088 --> 00:42:42,788
Did you ever see a bedroom farce?

699
00:42:42,989 --> 00:42:46,189
You mean the kind where the wrong man hides
under the bed?

700
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,790
Atta girl, now we're getting there.

701
00:42:48,791 --> 00:42:52,191
Only in this case, you see,
the wrong man must not only be uh...

702
00:42:53,192 --> 00:42:54,892
but uh...

703
00:42:56,293 --> 00:42:57,793
But what, Mr. Smith?

704
00:42:57,794 --> 00:43:01,794
Oh, really, really. There's no use of our talking
until we can find an interpreter.

705
00:43:01,795 --> 00:43:03,895
Or until we get to know each other better.

706
00:43:04,996 --> 00:43:07,896
Oh, here's your friend.
Well, well, here you are!

707
00:43:07,897 --> 00:43:11,097
I've been looking everywhere for you.
Just in time. Won't you sit down?

708
00:43:11,098 --> 00:43:15,798
Oh, not in this morgue.
Didn't you say something about the Whoopie Club?

709
00:43:15,799 --> 00:43:20,199
Diane's never been up on the roof there,
have you, darling?

710
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,300
My husband never takes me any place.
Oh, you poor girl.

711
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:27,801
Well, Mr. Smith is going to fix all that,
aren't you?

712
00:43:27,802 --> 00:43:30,202
Fix the roof? Oh, oh...

713
00:43:30,203 --> 00:43:35,603
Man! Well, we'll start on the roof...
And finish in the gutter.

714
00:43:35,604 --> 00:43:37,404
Oh, Mr. Smith!

715
00:43:49,605 --> 00:43:52,005
Andrews!
Beg your pardon, mam.

716
00:43:52,006 --> 00:43:55,606
You're paralyzed.
I'm not paralyzed. can't you see me moving?

717
00:43:55,607 --> 00:43:58,607
Where are you going?
Give this to the tailor. He's waiting.

718
00:44:13,008 --> 00:44:16,008
Good morning, dear.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

719
00:44:16,009 --> 00:44:19,709
Not at all, mother.
I'm just dying to have a little talk with you.

720
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:23,610
How did Dickie like his little surprise?
Oh, Mother!

721
00:44:23,991 --> 00:44:26,111
If you only knew.

722
00:44:26,112 --> 00:44:30,312
Oh, then you really have something to tell me.
I'll tell the world I have.

723
00:44:30,313 --> 00:44:32,013
Never mind the world. Tell me.

724
00:44:32,914 --> 00:44:35,414
Was Dickie glad to have you home again?

725
00:44:35,415 --> 00:44:37,815
Glad? He was beside himself.

726
00:44:37,816 --> 00:44:41,716
Oh, Mother. this is going to be the turning point
in Dickie's married life.

727
00:44:41,717 --> 00:44:44,317
Lovely.
Wait till I tell you everything.

728
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:48,118
I'm so happy. I must go and congratulate Dickie.

729
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:50,719
I wouldn't do that. Don't disturb him.

730
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,420
He's napping.
Shall I have your breakfast served here in the room?

731
00:44:54,421 --> 00:44:58,321
No. I'm going for a walk before breakfast this morning.

732
00:44:58,322 --> 00:45:00,922
I feel as if the world is mine.

733
00:45:00,923 --> 00:45:05,900
At last I have what I'd been hoping for.
You have? What is it?

734
00:45:05,901 --> 00:45:08,901
A hold on my husband that he'll never be able to break.

735
00:45:08,902 --> 00:45:11,102
Oh, you darling!

736
00:45:11,703 --> 00:45:15,203
Pitter-patter, pitter-patter.

737
00:45:17,204 --> 00:45:20,704
Pitter-patter, pitter-patter...

738
00:45:28,505 --> 00:45:32,105
The very idea. At this time of the morning, dumb.

739
00:45:32,106 --> 00:45:36,006
When Mr. Smith wakens he'll attend to you, my man.

740
00:45:36,007 --> 00:45:42,007
My man, indeed. My man?
I'm nobody's man but my own.

741
00:45:46,208 --> 00:45:47,508
Good morning, Mr. Smith.

742
00:45:47,509 --> 00:45:49,209
What's good about it?

743
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:54,610
Didn't you sleep well, sir?
I didn't sleep one wink the whole night long.

744
00:45:54,611 --> 00:45:57,511
Who the devil locked my door?
It wasn't the devil, sir.

745
00:45:57,512 --> 00:45:58,999
It was Mrs. Mantel.
Oh.

746
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,800
What time is it?
Nine o'clock.

747
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:03,401
Oh, I've got to get out of here.

748
00:46:04,202 --> 00:46:07,302
Where's my coat?
I just gave it to the tailor, sir.

749
00:46:07,303 --> 00:46:11,203
He brought back your other dressing gown.
A dressing gown won't help me. I want my coat.

750
00:46:11,999 --> 00:46:14,504
You don't seem to be yourself this morning, sir.

751
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:17,105
I'm not!
Perhaps you need something to eat.

752
00:46:17,106 --> 00:46:22,206
Won't you have your breakfast now, sir?
Oh, yes, yes, yes,. Anything to keep you quiet.

753
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:24,007
Where's the dining room?

754
00:46:26,008 --> 00:46:28,808
What, sir?
I said where is it?

755
00:46:28,809 --> 00:46:33,309
In the dining room?
Yes, sir. Breakfast in the dining room.

756
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:36,810
It's not being served in the coal cellar.
I don't want to go in the dining room.

757
00:46:37,411 --> 00:46:40,611
I want you to get me a cup of coffee
and some cracked ice and some white rock.

758
00:46:40,612 --> 00:46:44,212
And don't stand there gaping at me like that.
Put that thing down. Hurry!

759
00:46:44,213 --> 00:46:47,313
Yes... yes... yes.

760
00:46:47,314 --> 00:46:49,914
Wait!
Yes, sir.

761
00:46:49,915 --> 00:46:52,515
Don't rush out on me like that before I finish
talking to you.

762
00:46:52,816 --> 00:46:56,016
Where is Mrs. Smith and uh... Mrs...

763
00:46:56,017 --> 00:46:57,717
the other one, my mother-in-law?

764
00:46:57,718 --> 00:47:00,618
You mean Mrs. Mantel.
Yes.

765
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:02,919
She's gone upstairs.
Oh.

766
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,320
And if you please, sir...
No, I don't please.

767
00:47:05,321 --> 00:47:08,621
You get my coffee and my coat.
Yes, sir...

768
00:47:08,622 --> 00:47:11,622
Wait!
Yes.

769
00:47:11,623 --> 00:47:13,323
Where can I find a comb and brush?

770
00:47:15,824 --> 00:47:17,824
Have you looked where you always keep them, sir?

771
00:47:17,825 --> 00:47:20,525
Have I looked where I always keep them.

772
00:47:20,526 --> 00:47:22,226
Where do I always keep them?

773
00:47:22,227 --> 00:47:24,527
Let's see if you have intelligence enough
to answer me that.

774
00:47:24,528 --> 00:47:27,928
Why, sir... in the cabinet.

775
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:31,629
In the dressing room, of course.
Why didn't you say so in the first place?

776
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:39,530
He must have had a terrible night.

777
00:47:39,531 --> 00:47:40,531
Terrible.

778
00:48:50,032 --> 00:48:52,532
Safe in my home port...

779
00:48:53,733 --> 00:48:56,333
the safest port of all.

780
00:49:02,734 --> 00:49:06,834
Hey, lady. Will you pick out some place and land?

781
00:49:06,835 --> 00:49:09,935
Will you please make up your mind.

782
00:49:13,236 --> 00:49:17,236
That's all right, that's all right.
Just keep driving around.

783
00:49:19,037 --> 00:49:22,037
Where are we?
Hey, that ain't the question.

784
00:49:22,038 --> 00:49:26,438
For hours I've been driving you around.
Say, what's the matter? Ain't you got no home?

785
00:49:26,439 --> 00:49:30,239
Oh... I can't go home.

786
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,040
My husband'll know I've been out all night.

787
00:49:35,241 --> 00:49:38,241
Hey, look. Maybe I'd better drive you
to the Police Station.

788
00:49:38,242 --> 00:49:39,642
No.

789
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:42,543
I don't know anybody there.

790
00:49:43,644 --> 00:49:47,144
Hmm... let's see,
Take me to Mr. Smith.

791
00:49:47,945 --> 00:49:51,445
Oh. Mr. Smith eh?

792
00:49:52,146 --> 00:49:54,546
Yeah. Any particular one?

793
00:49:55,147 --> 00:49:58,847
Mr. Richard Smith. My lawyer.

794
00:50:00,648 --> 00:50:02,248
And where does he live?

795
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:05,149
1405, Park Avenue.

796
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:09,750
1405, Park.
Yeah, 14... no.

797
00:50:10,951 --> 00:50:14,851
14... 1540...

798
00:50:15,952 --> 00:50:18,252
1054...

799
00:50:19,053 --> 00:50:21,453
Either that or 4501.

800
00:50:21,454 --> 00:50:27,454
Hey, lady, will you make up your mind?
Will you please make up your mind, please.

801
00:50:41,155 --> 00:50:45,155
Why, Andrews. That's the nicest thing
you've ever done for me.

802
00:50:45,156 --> 00:50:47,056
You've guessed exactly what I needed.

803
00:50:47,757 --> 00:50:53,757
Yes. I didn't guess it, sir.
You told me to bring it in the most impatient tone.

804
00:50:54,458 --> 00:50:57,558
In a what?
In a most impatient tone.

805
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:01,659
Well, then it must have been mental telepathy.
You know, the effect of mind over matter.

806
00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:03,860
Or else, you've been dreaming.

807
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:06,961
Yes, sir. I'm beginning to think so, sir.

808
00:51:08,362 --> 00:51:11,662
Didn't you find your comb and brush?

809
00:51:12,463 --> 00:51:16,763
What comb and brush?
Why, the one you were looking for, sir.

810
00:51:16,764 --> 00:51:19,464
Don't you suppose I know where to find
my own comb and brush?

811
00:51:19,465 --> 00:51:22,465
Andrews! You're drunk.

812
00:51:22,666 --> 00:51:26,366
Yes, sir. A little drunker than I thought, sir.

813
00:51:26,367 --> 00:51:28,167
And you dare to admit it.

814
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:31,968
You dare to stand there staggering at me
at 9 o'clock in the morning.

815
00:51:32,569 --> 00:51:36,369
Well, sir, you see, I've been having a little trouble.

816
00:51:36,370 --> 00:51:38,270
You've been having a little liquid lightning.

817
00:51:38,271 --> 00:51:42,471
Only one flash... I mean nip, sir.
Well, quit nipping.

818
00:51:42,472 --> 00:51:44,772
Do you think you're strong enough
to get me some more of this white rock?

819
00:51:46,273 --> 00:51:49,573
Yes, sir. Though I wish you'd have your breakfast, sir.

820
00:51:49,574 --> 00:51:53,674
I don't see why you don't want to go in the dining room.

821
00:51:55,375 --> 00:51:59,275
Such a nice dining room.
Who said I didn't want to go into the dining room?

822
00:51:59,276 --> 00:52:01,376
Of course it's a nice dining room.
It's my dining room.

823
00:52:01,377 --> 00:52:03,477
I'd like to see anybody try to keep me out of it.

824
00:52:05,878 --> 00:52:08,178
I'm glad to hear you say that, sir.

825
00:52:09,279 --> 00:52:12,379
You do know where it is, don't you?
Why, certainly.

826
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:14,080
If nobody's moved it.

827
00:52:17,081 --> 00:52:19,881
See who that is.
Yes, sir, yes, sir.

828
00:52:23,382 --> 00:52:26,482
He must have had a worse night than I expected.

829
00:52:26,483 --> 00:52:27,683
Much worse.

830
00:52:43,384 --> 00:52:46,484
Excuse me, sir, but it's...
I don't care who it is.

831
00:52:46,485 --> 00:52:47,999
Who the devil drank my coffee?

832
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,200
Why, you did, sir.
Before you went in the dining room.

833
00:52:55,201 --> 00:52:58,501
I went in to comb my hair.
But you didn't comb your hair.

834
00:52:58,502 --> 00:53:01,502
I didn't, didn't I?
Are you losing your mind?

835
00:53:03,603 --> 00:53:06,503
Yes, sir. I'm beginning to think so, sir.

836
00:53:06,504 --> 00:53:08,304
Well, you snap out of it and bring me some more coffee.

837
00:53:08,905 --> 00:53:11,705
Yes, sir. I was just going to, sir.

838
00:53:11,706 --> 00:53:14,306
When you told me to answer the front doorbell.

839
00:53:14,307 --> 00:53:17,007
I told you to answer the...

840
00:53:17,008 --> 00:53:19,308
Well, you're hearing things as well as seeing them.

841
00:53:19,309 --> 00:53:22,809
Well, I did hear the front doorbell, sir.

842
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:28,210
Because there's proof of that.
I opened it for two young ladies who wanted to see you.

843
00:53:28,211 --> 00:53:30,511
Two young ladies?
Yes, sir.

844
00:53:30,512 --> 00:53:33,912
They're dressed just alike. They must be twins.

845
00:53:33,913 --> 00:53:37,913
Well, I haven't any twins.
You tell them to come back late this afternoon.

846
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:40,714
He ought to be here by then.
He?

847
00:53:41,415 --> 00:53:42,915
He?
Who?

848
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:45,916
Oh, he. Whenever I say he I always mean I.

849
00:53:45,917 --> 00:53:47,417
Hadn't you noticed that?

850
00:53:49,018 --> 00:53:52,418
Not yet, sir.
Well you keep that in mind and bring my coffee to my room.

851
00:53:52,419 --> 00:53:55,219
And some white rock.
Yes, sir.

852
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:59,820
Nobody knows what a night he must have had.

853
00:53:59,999 --> 00:54:01,721
Nobody.

854
00:54:05,522 --> 00:54:09,322
Andrews. Don't move so fast.
You'll break the speed limit.

855
00:54:09,323 --> 00:54:12,923
Oh, oh, sir... you...

856
00:54:12,924 --> 00:54:14,224
You've come back.

857
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:21,425
You do want me to go to the front door
before I bring you white rock and coffee, don't you?

858
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:23,000
I don't want any more coffee, stupid.

859
00:54:23,701 --> 00:54:27,001
I told you to answer that front door five minutes ago.

860
00:54:27,002 --> 00:54:28,502
What have you been doing? Walking backwards?

861
00:54:30,003 --> 00:54:33,903
Yes, sir. Perhaps I have without knowing it.

862
00:54:33,904 --> 00:54:36,504
You know, you've got to cut out this
early morning drinking.

863
00:54:37,505 --> 00:54:41,005
Yes, sir, I will, sir. Indeed I will.
You'd better.

864
00:54:41,906 --> 00:54:44,206
I'll try and pull myself together, sir.

865
00:54:45,107 --> 00:54:47,607
I'll tell the young ladies to call back later.

866
00:54:47,608 --> 00:54:49,508
What young ladies?

867
00:54:50,809 --> 00:54:54,509
The twins, sir. You said you couldn't see them.

868
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:57,010
Andrews, this is getting serious.

869
00:54:57,011 --> 00:55:00,011
You never said one word to me about twins.

870
00:55:04,112 --> 00:55:06,912
Didn't I?
You certainly did not.

871
00:55:07,413 --> 00:55:09,213
Where are these ladies?

872
00:55:12,314 --> 00:55:14,114
In the reception room, sir.

873
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:21,515
The twin, sir.

874
00:55:22,216 --> 00:55:25,316
Oh, hello, Dickie bird.

875
00:55:29,017 --> 00:55:31,617
I'm so glad I found you.
You are?

876
00:55:31,618 --> 00:55:33,318
Well, I'm glad somebody's glad.

877
00:55:33,319 --> 00:55:35,319
Where's the rest of you?
Andrew said you were twins.

878
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:39,220
There were two of her, sir.
I swear there were two of her.

879
00:55:39,221 --> 00:55:42,421
Oh, that's nothing. I've been seeing four.

880
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:46,122
Four taxi cabs, four front doors...

881
00:55:46,123 --> 00:55:51,423
four fine old butlers and
four cute little Dickie birds.

882
00:55:51,424 --> 00:55:53,324
Yes, please, please, please.

883
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:55,725
Don't go, Andrews, wait.

884
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,726
What do you mean by coming here, Miss O'Dare?

885
00:55:58,727 --> 00:56:02,627
When you told me last night that you had
to go home alone, didn't I put you in a taxi cab?

886
00:56:02,628 --> 00:56:05,128
Didn't I give the taxi cab driver your address?
Didn't I?

887
00:56:05,129 --> 00:56:09,729
Yes, but the nasty old taxi cab fell apart.

888
00:56:09,730 --> 00:56:13,730
And it took him ages and ages to get together again.

889
00:56:14,331 --> 00:56:18,831
And anyway, I had no money.
So I made him bring me here.

890
00:56:18,832 --> 00:56:20,732
He's waiting outside.

891
00:56:21,533 --> 00:56:25,033
Oh, money? That's all...
Yes, that's simple...

892
00:56:25,034 --> 00:56:27,634
Oh, by Joe, I haven't a cent left myself.

893
00:56:27,635 --> 00:56:31,835
Andrews...
I haven't a cent. That's one thing I'm sure of.

894
00:56:31,836 --> 00:56:33,736
Would you go out to the kitchen
and borrow some from the cook.

895
00:56:33,737 --> 00:56:37,537
She ought to have some. She was paid yesterday.
I hope you know where that kitchen is.

896
00:56:37,538 --> 00:56:39,638
Yes, sir.
Well, hurry!

897
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:41,439
Yes, sir.

898
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,540
Oh, Dickie. I'm so relieved!
Wheee!

899
00:56:44,541 --> 00:56:47,941
Diane, please!
You want to fight? You chase me.

900
00:56:47,942 --> 00:56:51,042
Diane, please, keep quiet.
I'm too happy to keep quiet.

901
00:56:51,043 --> 00:56:52,543
You come down here!
I don't want to.

902
00:56:52,544 --> 00:56:54,944
Come down here!
You come right down here!

903
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:57,845
I don't wanna.
Come down this minute!

904
00:56:57,846 --> 00:56:59,146
No!
Come!

905
00:56:59,147 --> 00:57:00,347
All right.

906
00:57:00,748 --> 00:57:03,748
Wheee! Whoopie!

907
00:57:05,349 --> 00:57:08,049
What is this, please?
A hangover or a fresh start?

908
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:13,350
Oh, Dickie bird, don't be harsh with me.
Anybody'd think you're my husband.

909
00:57:13,351 --> 00:57:15,451
I am always harsh in the morning.

910
00:57:15,452 --> 00:57:17,352
My loose moments end with breakfast.

911
00:57:17,353 --> 00:57:20,653
Anything you have to say to me today
will come under the head of New Business.

912
00:57:20,654 --> 00:57:24,354
Well I don't want any new business.
Old was good enough for me.

913
00:57:26,555 --> 00:57:29,355
If you please, sir. The cook hasn't a nickel.

914
00:57:29,356 --> 00:57:31,056
Nobody has a nickel.

915
00:57:31,057 --> 00:57:33,257
I don't want a nickel. What good is a nickel?

916
00:57:33,258 --> 00:57:38,288
You go outside, go outside and find out exactly
how much the taxi cab bill is.

917
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:39,889
Hurry, hurry!

918
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:42,090
Oh, what am I going to do?

919
00:57:44,091 --> 00:57:45,991
Musette!
Oui, monsieur, qu'est-ce qu'il y a?

920
00:57:45,992 --> 00:57:47,792
Would you like to earn 20 dollars?
Oui, monsieur.

921
00:57:47,793 --> 00:57:49,893
Will you get this lady out of the guest room, quick.
Oui, monsieur.

922
00:57:49,894 --> 00:57:51,694
Don't let anybody see her.
Non, monsieur.

923
00:57:51,695 --> 00:57:55,295
She came to see me on business,
but Mrs. Mantel may not understand.

924
00:57:55,296 --> 00:57:56,956
No, monsieur, but I understand.
Yes.

925
00:57:56,957 --> 00:57:59,757
Come, madame.
No, no. I don't wanna go...

926
00:57:59,758 --> 00:58:03,358
I don't wanna go upstairs.
Upstairs or I spank.

927
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:07,559
There you go reminding me of my husband again.

928
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:11,960
Oh, poor Felix.
What would he think if he could see me now?

929
00:58:12,861 --> 00:58:14,561
Come, madame, we go...

930
00:58:14,562 --> 00:58:16,562
I don't wanna go upstairs.

931
00:58:17,063 --> 00:58:19,363
That's all right, that's all right.

932
00:58:19,364 --> 00:58:23,864
Listen, the bill is 50 bucks and I'm gonna get it
or I'm gonna take it out of somebody's hide.

933
00:58:23,865 --> 00:58:27,165
Do you understand?
Yes... yes... You'll get your hide.

934
00:58:28,466 --> 00:58:29,466
I mean, your money.

935
00:58:31,167 --> 00:58:33,667
Here, madame. You will be safe here.

936
00:58:36,868 --> 00:58:38,268
Oh, no, madame!

937
00:58:38,269 --> 00:58:41,569
Madame, come here. I will get you a negligÃ©e, hm?

938
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:46,470
The bill is 50 hide, sir.
I mean dollars.

939
00:58:46,471 --> 00:58:49,271
See if you can pry it out of Mrs. Mantel, will you?

940
00:58:49,272 --> 00:58:52,672
Wouldn't it be better if I went to the bank, sir?

941
00:58:52,673 --> 00:58:54,373
That's a good idea. Go ahead.

942
00:58:54,374 --> 00:58:56,174
You go over to the bank...
Yes, sir.

943
00:58:56,175 --> 00:58:59,775
And, on your way to the bank,
well, something got spilled on my coat last night.

944
00:58:59,776 --> 00:59:01,576
Drop in and leave it at the tailor's for me, will you?

945
00:59:04,877 --> 00:59:07,977
Your... your coat?
Yes.

946
00:59:07,978 --> 00:59:10,478
My coat. What's the matter?
It won't bite you.

947
00:59:11,979 --> 00:59:14,779
But I... I... I...

948
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:18,180
I gave it to the tailor not half hour ago, sir.

949
00:59:18,781 --> 00:59:20,481
You gave him my coat?

950
00:59:21,282 --> 00:59:24,782
Yes, sir... I... gave him your coat.

951
00:59:27,783 --> 00:59:29,483
I'm afraid I'm going mad!

952
00:59:29,484 --> 00:59:31,484
Come, come, pull yourself together, old man.

953
00:59:32,685 --> 00:59:36,485
I can't, sir. I seem to have lost all control.

954
00:59:37,486 --> 00:59:40,186
I'm beginning to see them. There...

955
00:59:40,187 --> 00:59:43,987
There!
I'm afraid they'll get me!

956
00:59:44,588 --> 00:59:46,288
I got to go somewhere!

957
00:59:46,289 --> 00:59:50,489
I got to do something. I can't stand it!

958
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:51,990
I can't stand it!

959
00:59:51,991 --> 00:59:53,891
I can't stand it!

960
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:56,892
I can't stand it! Let me out!

961
00:59:56,893 --> 00:59:59,093
Let me out of here!

962
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,394
Kitty Minter!
Diane!

963
01:00:15,495 --> 01:00:19,895
Well, I can't go home to Felix in a dress like this
at this time of the morning, can I?

964
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:24,896
No.
Say, you go home and get me a dress.

965
01:00:24,897 --> 01:00:26,897
All right, all right. I'll be back in a jiffy.

966
01:00:26,898 --> 01:00:27,898
Fine.

967
01:00:30,899 --> 01:00:33,899
Richard!
Oh, hello, Mother.

968
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,800
How are you?
I'm perfectly well.

969
01:00:35,901 --> 01:00:37,401
Well, that's swell.

970
01:00:38,962 --> 01:00:41,702
Well, you see? Just getting ready for work.

971
01:00:41,703 --> 01:00:46,603
Work? Why, I never dreamed you wanted to go to work
this morning after what happened last night.

972
01:00:46,904 --> 01:00:48,804
Why, what do you know about last night?

973
01:00:48,805 --> 01:00:51,155
Oh, not very much. But I can guess, can't I?

974
01:00:51,156 --> 01:00:54,356
Yes, yes, you can guess.
You're some little guesser.

975
01:00:54,357 --> 01:00:57,657
Richard, I'm afraid you're going to be angry
with me.

976
01:00:57,658 --> 01:00:59,999
But I meant it all for the best.

977
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,400
You meant what for the best?
When I locked you in last night.

978
01:01:03,401 --> 01:01:07,401
You locked me in?
Hm... you were acting a bit strangely.

979
01:01:07,402 --> 01:01:12,102
You seemed nervous and excited.
So I decided to give you a dose of prevention.

980
01:01:12,103 --> 01:01:17,203
After you went to bed I locked all the doors
and took the keys upstairs with me.

981
01:01:18,504 --> 01:01:21,004
You locked all the doors after I went to bed.

982
01:01:21,005 --> 01:01:23,305
Oh... well, then I couldn't have gotten out.

983
01:01:23,306 --> 01:01:25,406
I couldn't have gotten out even if I wanted to.

984
01:01:25,407 --> 01:01:28,307
Of course you couldn't, Richard.
And I was in there all night.

985
01:01:32,108 --> 01:01:34,408
Are you ill again?
No, Mother, I'm better.

986
01:01:34,409 --> 01:01:36,409
Oh, I'm much better.

987
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:38,610
Oh, what a joke.

988
01:01:38,611 --> 01:01:42,811
Locked in cold storage all night.
Mother, you are simply priceless.

989
01:01:42,812 --> 01:01:47,612
Who are you waving at?
Nothing, nothing, Mother. In fact, less than nothing.

990
01:01:47,613 --> 01:01:49,413
I'm simply waving at myself.

991
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:53,314
Oh, you're absurd, Richard.
I am, Mother, I'm more than absurd.

992
01:01:53,315 --> 01:01:55,815
I'm positively hilarious.

993
01:01:56,816 --> 01:02:00,116
Oh, now I understand what was the matter
with poor old Andrews.

994
01:02:00,117 --> 01:02:03,717
Oh, he must have been seeing things
with a vengeance.

995
01:02:03,718 --> 01:02:08,018
Andrews' condition is no laughing matter.
I can't help it, mother.

996
01:02:08,019 --> 01:02:09,819
You'd laugh, too, if you knew what I knew.

997
01:02:09,820 --> 01:02:12,220
No, no, no, you wouldn't.

998
01:02:12,221 --> 01:02:15,421
Why not?
Don't you think I can appreciate a joke?

999
01:02:15,422 --> 01:02:17,722
Go on, tell me.
No, it's a secret.

1000
01:02:17,723 --> 01:02:19,823
And if I told you, it would be no joke.

1001
01:02:19,824 --> 01:02:22,724
Oh, now, don't tantalize me, Richard.

1002
01:02:22,725 --> 01:02:25,725
Is it about you?
Oh, oh, rather.

1003
01:02:26,726 --> 01:02:31,126
Is there someone else?
Oh, decidedly someone else.

1004
01:02:32,227 --> 01:02:35,427
And then is there another someone
mixed up with the two?

1005
01:02:35,428 --> 01:02:38,828
No, not exactly.
Well, not yet, anyway.

1006
01:02:38,829 --> 01:02:42,029
Not yet? Oh, Richard, I knew it.

1007
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:46,630
The secret is about you and someone else

1008
01:02:46,631 --> 01:02:50,431
and then another someone mixed up in it
a little later on...

1009
01:02:52,732 --> 01:02:56,132
You dear boy, it's the secret Madeline mentioned.

1010
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:00,003
Oh, you've had a letter from Madeline?

1011
01:03:00,004 --> 01:03:04,404
Have I had a letter?
Oh, you dear, ridiculous fellow.

1012
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:07,405
I don't blame you for being hilarious.

1013
01:03:08,506 --> 01:03:11,006
I'm a bit hilarious myself.

1014
01:03:20,707 --> 01:03:23,507
Mother. What is it you think you know?

1015
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:27,108
I don't think any longer. I'm sure.

1016
01:03:28,409 --> 01:03:30,809
Pitter-patter, pitter-patter.

1017
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:34,510
Pitter-patter, pitter-patter, pitter-patter...

1018
01:03:34,511 --> 01:03:39,611
Footsteps on the stairs,
Footsteps on the stairs

1019
01:03:39,612 --> 01:03:43,612
I hear them now, they're calling me
Footsteps on the stairs

1020
01:03:43,613 --> 01:03:46,513
If you're doing that for me, you can stop.

1021
01:03:48,314 --> 01:03:52,414
I want my coat.
Oh, Richard...

1022
01:03:54,715 --> 01:03:58,015
How can you think of coats at a time like this?

1023
01:03:59,016 --> 01:04:02,416
Baby coaties, perhaps.
Baby booties...

1024
01:04:02,417 --> 01:04:09,317
Pitter-patter, pitter-patter,
pitter-patter, pitter-patter.

1025
01:04:13,918 --> 01:04:15,818
Has she gone crazy, too?

1026
01:04:15,819 --> 01:04:19,519
There's something the matter with her.
Give her some air, give her some air.

1027
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:24,120
Will I take it out to her or bring it in to her?

1028
01:04:24,921 --> 01:04:28,621
Don't talk like a fool. Get her something to bring her
back to herself.

1029
01:04:28,622 --> 01:04:32,222
Yes, sir... now you're talking, sir.

1030
01:04:34,123 --> 01:04:36,423
Ah! Did monsieur have a good rest last night?

1031
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:43,024
Rest. Say, I'll never rest again until I get even
with that... that...

1032
01:04:51,325 --> 01:04:55,525
Say, how would you like to pick up 50 dollars?

1033
01:04:55,526 --> 01:04:58,726
Oh, monsieur...
All I want you to do is to kiss me...

1034
01:04:58,727 --> 01:05:02,527
the next time you see me and Mrs. Mantel
alone together.

1035
01:05:03,628 --> 01:05:06,228
And for why I kiss you when Mme. Mantel see?

1036
01:05:06,229 --> 01:05:10,629
It's a practical joke to get even with somebody
for laughing at me.

1037
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:14,800
Oh! And will Mme. Mantel laugh?
Will she laugh?

1038
01:05:14,801 --> 01:05:17,001
Say, I'll laugh myself.

1039
01:05:17,002 --> 01:05:21,202
Oh, well, for 50 dollars...
Uh-huh.

1040
01:05:22,003 --> 01:05:27,003
But suppose I lose my position.
Don't worry. You lose this one, I'll get you a better one.

1041
01:05:27,004 --> 01:05:31,304
Now, is it a go?
Oh, no, monsieur. It is a kiss.

1042
01:05:31,305 --> 01:05:34,505
The next time I see you with Mme. Mantel, non?

1043
01:05:34,506 --> 01:05:37,006
You won't forget.
Oh, how could I?

1044
01:05:48,507 --> 01:05:52,207
Excuse me, sir, but I forgot to give you the money.

1045
01:05:52,208 --> 01:05:54,208
Money? What money?

1046
01:05:55,609 --> 01:05:59,709
Why, the money you told me to get
for the young lady upstairs.

1047
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:01,910
Don't you remember, sir?

1048
01:06:01,911 --> 01:06:06,511
Oh, take, take it. Don't say that I haven't been
at the bank, sir.

1049
01:06:06,512 --> 01:06:10,912
Don't tell me it isn't real money.
I can't stand any more of it.

1050
01:06:10,913 --> 01:06:13,813
All right, all right, if it'll relieve your mind,
I'll take it.

1051
01:06:13,814 --> 01:06:15,114
I've earned it.

1052
01:06:15,115 --> 01:06:18,015
What will I do with this, sir?
Drink it yourself.

1053
01:06:39,216 --> 01:06:41,016
Give me that money!
Not on your life!

1054
01:06:41,017 --> 01:06:44,017
What do you mean by staying out all night?
Shut up. You talk like a mother-in-law.

1055
01:06:44,018 --> 01:06:46,118
Do you realize that I was locked up in that room
all night long?

1056
01:06:46,119 --> 01:06:49,019
Well, I'm sorry Mrs. Mantel locked you up, but...

1057
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:52,420
What's so funny about that?
Why, don't you think it's funny?

1058
01:06:52,421 --> 01:06:54,221
Funny? Say, what kind of a man are you?

1059
01:06:54,222 --> 01:06:57,322
Locked up? All alone? You don't know.

1060
01:06:57,323 --> 01:07:01,023
You don't know?
I know you've given me a marvelous joke on my mother-in-law

1061
01:07:01,024 --> 01:07:04,724
I can't tell her about it but I'll laugh every time
I think of it.

1062
01:07:04,725 --> 01:07:06,825
Thanks again. You can go now.

1063
01:07:06,826 --> 01:07:07,826
Not yet.

1064
01:07:08,527 --> 01:07:10,327
Huh? What's that?

1065
01:07:11,328 --> 01:07:14,328
I'm not going to leave this house until I get my big laugh.

1066
01:07:14,329 --> 01:07:18,829
It'll cost me 50 dollars
and I want to be here to enjoy it, ha, ha, ha.

1067
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:21,430
Hey, wait a minute, what are you talking about?

1068
01:07:21,431 --> 01:07:23,531
Yoo-hoo, yoo-hoo

1069
01:07:24,732 --> 01:07:26,332
Richard...

1070
01:07:27,533 --> 01:07:29,933
Mother, why don't you go upstairs
and take a nap?

1071
01:07:29,934 --> 01:07:31,634
A good, long nap.

1072
01:07:31,635 --> 01:07:34,235
You ought to be laid out somewhere.
Laid out?

1073
01:07:34,236 --> 01:07:37,236
Ah, monsieur, the time has come, no?

1074
01:07:39,437 --> 01:07:41,437
Oh, my word! Stop it! Stop it!

1075
01:07:41,438 --> 01:07:45,638
Stop it! What do you think I am? A lollipop?

1076
01:07:45,639 --> 01:07:48,939
Shameless creature!
Who ordered this?

1077
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:52,600
What's the matter? What is the joke?
Why she did not laugh?

1078
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:56,201
Why she do not laugh?
You can figure that out while you're packing your trunk.

1079
01:07:56,202 --> 01:07:59,502
I knew she was French, but I made allowances for that.

1080
01:07:59,999 --> 01:08:03,703
Why did you kiss Mr. Smith under my very nose?
Pardon me, Mother, Under my very nose!

1081
01:08:03,704 --> 01:08:05,904
You told me to.
I? I never did.

1082
01:08:06,305 --> 01:08:10,995
Yes! You lie! You promised me 50 dollars!
Fifty dollars? What are you talking about?

1083
01:08:10,996 --> 01:08:12,496
Fifty dollars is too much for any woman.

1084
01:08:12,497 --> 01:08:13,897
What is this? A badger game?

1085
01:08:13,898 --> 01:08:15,898
You don't stay in this house another minute!

1086
01:08:15,899 --> 01:08:19,599
No? Then he has to give me another job.
You promised.

1087
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,100
I promised? I never promised... I...

1088
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,201
Oh! I have a very good idea who did.

1089
01:08:26,202 --> 01:08:28,002
You go on. You get out of here.
Get out!

1090
01:08:34,999 --> 01:08:36,604
I resent that!

1091
01:08:36,605 --> 01:08:41,305
Richard? What did she say then?
She sent you her best regards.

1092
01:08:41,606 --> 01:08:46,206
Richard Smith.
Are you quite sure you didn't ask her to kiss you?

1093
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:48,207
Oh, Mother. I don't have to ask to be kissed.

1094
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:49,908
What?
I... I mean... but...

1095
01:08:49,909 --> 01:08:52,809
I have my own dear sweet little wife.

1096
01:08:52,810 --> 01:08:55,210
Yes, and she'd understand if she were home.

1097
01:08:55,211 --> 01:08:57,311
You can tell her when she comes in.

1098
01:08:57,312 --> 01:08:59,112
What?
She'll be home in a minute.

1099
01:08:59,113 --> 01:09:00,513
Home? I don't believe it.

1100
01:09:00,514 --> 01:09:02,214
Well. You just wait here and see.

1101
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,215
Come on. You gotta get out. My wife is coming.
Wait a minute.

1102
01:09:10,216 --> 01:09:12,116
Wait a minute? A minute'll be too late.

1103
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:18,718
Wait, wait, wait!
I can't go out in the street with this!

1104
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:21,719
Well I go out with mine every day.
But if you're so fussy, there!

1105
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:23,020
Outside!

1106
01:09:25,921 --> 01:09:29,421
Dickie!
Oh... darling!

1107
01:09:29,422 --> 01:09:31,722
You have come home.

1108
01:09:31,723 --> 01:09:35,523
Well, well, well.
Dickie boy!

1109
01:09:35,524 --> 01:09:38,524
Didn't you expect me?
No... yes, of course, of course...

1110
01:09:38,525 --> 01:09:42,965
But not so soon.
If you only had any idea how lonely I've been.

1111
01:09:42,966 --> 01:09:44,566
Oh, Dickie...

1112
01:09:45,667 --> 01:09:51,067
Oh, Dickie, is this gentleman a friend of yours?
Oh, no, he's no gentleman...

1113
01:09:51,068 --> 01:09:52,868
He's no friend, it's Mr. Zero...

1114
01:09:52,869 --> 01:09:55,069
Mr. Zero, yes, my wife, Mrs. Smith.

1115
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:58,070
And Mrs. Mantel, my mother... my wife's mother.

1116
01:09:58,071 --> 01:09:59,271
I'm delighted.

1117
01:09:59,272 --> 01:10:01,972
Mr. Zero is the famous vaudeville artist.

1118
01:10:01,973 --> 01:10:05,573
Oh, I've heard of you.
Oh, thank you.

1119
01:10:05,574 --> 01:10:09,000
He has done me the honor to want to add me
to his list of impersonations.

1120
01:10:09,001 --> 01:10:12,201
No doubt he does it to perfection.
Oh, how wonderful!

1121
01:10:12,202 --> 01:10:16,202
Breakfast is ready.
If you want it, come and get it.

1122
01:10:17,503 --> 01:10:19,203
Won't you have breakfast with us?

1123
01:10:19,204 --> 01:10:21,304
Why, delighted, if I'm not intruding.

1124
01:10:21,305 --> 01:10:26,105
Oh, no. My husband's friends are my friends.
Oh, yes indeed.

1125
01:10:26,106 --> 01:10:29,906
But at a time like this? I understand
you've just returned home from a vacation.

1126
01:10:29,907 --> 01:10:31,807
That's perfectly all right.

1127
01:10:34,908 --> 01:10:37,808
You have no idea, dear, how glad I am to see you.

1128
01:10:37,809 --> 01:10:40,509
Why didn't you let me know you were coming?
I wanted to surprise you.

1129
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:44,110
You did.
Oh, I shall never forget the look on your face...

1130
01:10:44,111 --> 01:10:46,311
when I walked in last night.

1131
01:10:51,212 --> 01:10:52,612
Last night?

1132
01:10:54,113 --> 01:10:57,413
Come, Mr. Zero.

1133
01:11:01,914 --> 01:11:03,314
Coming, darling?

1134
01:11:03,315 --> 01:11:05,215
Last night?

1135
01:11:08,016 --> 01:11:10,116
Dickie, darling!
Dickie, what's wrong?

1136
01:11:10,117 --> 01:11:12,117
Why, what's happened?

1137
01:11:12,118 --> 01:11:14,718
Dickie, come on, dear.

1138
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:17,519
What is it?
Oh, my poor darling, you're ruined.

1139
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:19,720
I mean, I'm ruined... Our home is ruined.

1140
01:11:19,721 --> 01:11:24,521
Oh, my poor Richard. And you seemed so well this morning
when you first woke up.

1141
01:11:25,422 --> 01:11:31,522
Oh, hold me, I'm going to faint again.
Oh, now, what you need is another old-fashioned rubdown...

1142
01:11:31,523 --> 01:11:33,223
like I gave you last night.

1143
01:11:33,224 --> 01:11:38,724
Oh, I want to die, I want to die...
Dickie, control yourself.

1144
01:11:38,725 --> 01:11:40,625
Let me help you to the couch.
No, I'll wait right here...

1145
01:11:40,626 --> 01:11:42,700
Come on, dear, come on.

1146
01:11:42,701 --> 01:11:46,501
Oh, Minty, you're a darling.
Now hurry and get into this and let's get out of here.

1147
01:11:46,502 --> 01:11:51,302
Oh, here, you can have this, sweetie.
I never want to see it again.

1148
01:11:51,303 --> 01:11:52,903
Merci beaucoup, madame.

1149
01:11:52,904 --> 01:11:54,504
Come on, dear, come on.
No, no...

1150
01:11:54,505 --> 01:11:55,905
Come on, like a good boy.

1151
01:11:55,906 --> 01:11:58,106
There, now everything's all right.

1152
01:11:58,107 --> 01:12:01,907
All right?
Oh, my poor Madeline.

1153
01:12:01,908 --> 01:12:06,208
No, your happy Madeline, darling.
Now tell me just what's troubling you, darling.

1154
01:12:06,509 --> 01:12:09,609
Oh, you don't know what you're asking.

1155
01:12:09,610 --> 01:12:12,710
Is it so serious?
You know, I could see last night...

1156
01:12:12,711 --> 01:12:15,311
the moment I saw you that you weren't yourself.

1157
01:12:15,312 --> 01:12:17,912
You could see that?

1158
01:12:17,913 --> 01:12:20,713
Yes, you were different.
Oh, awfully nice, darling.

1159
01:12:20,714 --> 01:12:22,214
Oh, awfully, awfully nice.

1160
01:12:22,215 --> 01:12:23,415
But different.

1161
01:12:23,416 --> 01:12:25,616
Well uh... how different?

1162
01:12:25,617 --> 01:12:31,817
Well, I've always known you were impulsive.
But last night... Oh, and in spite of your cold.

1163
01:12:31,818 --> 01:12:35,218
The way you kissed me.
Oh...

1164
01:12:35,219 --> 01:12:39,119
You feel so badly, sweetheart?
Oh, just dying, that's all, just dying.

1165
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:42,320
Oh, my poor nervous Dickie boy.

1166
01:12:42,321 --> 01:12:44,221
Perhaps I kept you awake too late.

1167
01:12:45,722 --> 01:12:47,922
But then, I had so much to tell you.

1168
01:12:47,923 --> 01:12:51,123
Yes, yes, I suppose you did.
You suppose? Don't you remember?

1169
01:12:51,124 --> 01:12:53,224
No... yes... You... err...

1170
01:12:53,225 --> 01:12:56,825
The joy of having you back, dear...
Just a little bit hazy...

1171
01:12:56,826 --> 01:12:59,426
Maybe I put too much whisky in your hot drink.

1172
01:12:59,427 --> 01:13:01,827
Did you give me a hot drink last night?

1173
01:13:01,828 --> 01:13:06,028
Of course, darling. After I had you all comfortable
and safely covered up.

1174
01:13:06,029 --> 01:13:09,429
Covered up?
Oh, I'm losing my mind, that's all.

1175
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:13,530
Madeline, go ahead, tell me...

1176
01:13:13,531 --> 01:13:15,331
Tell me what happened, what... what...

1177
01:13:15,332 --> 01:13:16,892
What did I do?

1178
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:19,193
Oh, Dickie, what didn't you do!

1179
01:13:20,294 --> 01:13:23,394
You know, I never realized before
that you were so versatile.

1180
01:13:24,495 --> 01:13:27,195
Versatile?
Yes, those imitations you gave.

1181
01:13:27,196 --> 01:13:28,796
Imitations of what?

1182
01:13:28,797 --> 01:13:30,097
Of all sorts of things.

1183
01:13:30,098 --> 01:13:31,798
And the jokes you played.

1184
01:13:31,799 --> 01:13:34,199
Why, Dickie, you were positively skittish.

1185
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:37,200
Skittish? Oh, my...

1186
01:13:38,001 --> 01:13:40,401
Go on, Madeline, tell me everything.

1187
01:13:40,402 --> 01:13:43,102
Why, Dickie, you must know as well as I do.

1188
01:13:43,103 --> 01:13:47,903
What was that lovely little Swiss Lullaby you sang?

1189
01:13:49,004 --> 01:13:52,404
Swiss Lullaby?
Yes, the one you yodeled to me.

1190
01:13:53,405 --> 01:13:55,205
Yodeled?

1191
01:13:55,206 --> 01:13:58,606
Oh, my word, I yodeled.

1192
01:13:58,607 --> 01:14:00,507
Oh, you must yodel more for me, often.

1193
01:14:00,508 --> 01:14:02,408
Now that I know you do it so well.

1194
01:14:04,109 --> 01:14:06,809
This is the end!
What nonsense, darling.

1195
01:14:06,810 --> 01:14:09,310
Why, I fixed you up last night and I'll do it again.

1196
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:11,911
I'll mix you a bracer as only your Madeline
knows how.

1197
01:14:11,912 --> 01:14:14,712
And then we'll go for a nice, long drive in the country.

1198
01:14:14,713 --> 01:14:16,513
You won't try to work today, will you?

1199
01:14:17,714 --> 01:14:21,014
Work? After the vaudeville show I gave last night?

1200
01:14:21,015 --> 01:14:22,815
Oh, no, now you must rest.

1201
01:14:22,816 --> 01:14:26,716
And then don't forget all the lovely things
we planned to do today.

1202
01:14:31,117 --> 01:14:33,817
Oh, dear, dear, dear.

1203
01:14:36,218 --> 01:14:39,918
Last night, last night, last night.

1204
01:14:46,519 --> 01:14:49,719
So, you yodeled to her, did you?

1205
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,720
Well, she liked it, didn't she?
I'll say she did.

1206
01:14:51,721 --> 01:14:57,321
She wants me to yodel again, often, and I can't.
Oh, you fiend, you hound!

1207
01:14:57,322 --> 01:14:58,922
Well, I like that!

1208
01:14:58,923 --> 01:15:01,623
After all the trouble I took not to give you away.

1209
01:15:01,624 --> 01:15:04,224
Why, she never for a moment suspected the difference.

1210
01:15:04,225 --> 01:15:06,925
What?
You didn't tell her you weren't home last night!?

1211
01:15:06,926 --> 01:15:09,826
That's a fine question.
Well, then everything's all right.

1212
01:15:09,827 --> 01:15:12,527
All right?
I knew just how to handle the situation.

1213
01:15:12,528 --> 01:15:14,628
I behaved exactly as you would have.

1214
01:15:14,629 --> 01:15:16,429
You knew how to handle the situation.

1215
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:19,730
You knew how to handle the situation!
By being skittish!

1216
01:15:19,831 --> 01:15:23,131
By telling her stories at midnight.
Just for a start!

1217
01:15:23,192 --> 01:15:26,432
Well, I had to do something to pass the time.
You asked me to impersonate you.

1218
01:15:26,433 --> 01:15:29,933
No excuse for you kissing her, Zero.
But I was you.

1219
01:15:29,934 --> 01:15:32,734
But I'm her husband.
Well so was I.

1220
01:15:34,635 --> 01:15:36,535
Put something into my hand!

1221
01:15:39,836 --> 01:15:42,936
I want to know exactly what happened last night!

1222
01:15:42,937 --> 01:15:45,437
Well, what do you think?

1223
01:15:45,438 --> 01:15:47,438
I can't think. I'm going mad.

1224
01:15:47,439 --> 01:15:48,939
Ha, ha, ha.

1225
01:15:48,940 --> 01:15:50,540
What are they arguing about out there?

1226
01:15:50,941 --> 01:15:51,941
Dickie!

1227
01:15:51,942 --> 01:15:53,542
Yes, dear.

1228
01:15:53,543 --> 01:15:56,443
Shut up! She means me!
How do you know?

1229
01:15:56,444 --> 01:15:58,344
For that I'll murder you!

1230
01:15:58,345 --> 01:16:01,245
Here, honey, drink this.
It's what made you feel so good last night.

1231
01:16:03,346 --> 01:16:04,746
I'm going mad!

1232
01:16:04,947 --> 01:16:07,147
Why, what's happened?

1233
01:16:07,848 --> 01:16:09,448
Don't you go away from here.

1234
01:16:12,349 --> 01:16:14,149
Perhaps I'd better.
I think so.

1235
01:16:14,150 --> 01:16:15,150
Will you excuse me?
Oh, yes.

1236
01:16:15,151 --> 01:16:16,151
Thank you.

1237
01:16:24,452 --> 01:16:25,652
Diane!

1238
01:16:27,053 --> 01:16:29,253
Why... what have you done to her?
She fainted.

1239
01:16:29,254 --> 01:16:30,254
Fainted?

1240
01:16:34,755 --> 01:16:36,255
What's happened? Who is this?

1241
01:16:36,256 --> 01:16:38,456
That's Dickie's new secretary.
Secretary?

1242
01:16:38,457 --> 01:16:39,857
And who is this?
My wife.

1243
01:16:39,858 --> 01:16:42,258
Your wife?
Yes. What was she doing here?

1244
01:16:42,259 --> 01:16:43,659
Listening. She knows everything.

1245
01:16:44,860 --> 01:16:46,060
She's coming to.

1246
01:16:49,461 --> 01:16:51,961
Oh, you yodeled to her!

1247
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,462
How long has she been here?
Long enough to hear everything.

1248
01:17:03,963 --> 01:17:05,563
I'm shooting the wrong man.

1249
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,364
Poor girl.

1250
01:17:14,665 --> 01:17:16,165
Well, dear, do you feel any better?

1251
01:17:16,166 --> 01:17:17,866
I don't know. I haven't made up my mind.

1252
01:17:17,867 --> 01:17:20,900
Well, I'm glad you've come back because I think it's about time
you were told the truth about everything.

1253
01:17:20,901 --> 01:17:24,001
Yes, that's what I want, the truth.
The whole truth about everything.

1254
01:17:31,602 --> 01:17:34,202
Well, now that we're here, we can talk
about this whole thing calmly.

1255
01:17:34,203 --> 01:17:36,203
We might as well all sit down.
Sit down, dear.

1256
01:17:36,204 --> 01:17:38,504
I will not sit down.
Dickie, sit down!

1257
01:17:39,705 --> 01:17:41,205
I'm rested now.

1258
01:17:41,206 --> 01:17:43,506
Richard, I want you to know Mrs. Zero.

1259
01:17:44,207 --> 01:17:45,407
Mrs. Ze..?

1260
01:17:46,208 --> 01:17:48,208
Your wife?
Why, certainly!

1261
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:54,209
Oh, I'm glad to meet you.

1262
01:17:54,210 --> 01:17:55,710
Now, to begin with...

1263
01:17:55,711 --> 01:17:57,311
Musette, where are you going?

1264
01:17:57,312 --> 01:18:00,712
I have been discharged, madame.
Discharged? Who discharged you?

1265
01:18:00,713 --> 01:18:02,513
This lady.
I had to.

1266
01:18:02,514 --> 01:18:06,014
Her French was breaking out something awful.
Her French breaking out?

1267
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:11,115
Well, if you must know the truth, she became so brazen
as to kiss Dickie right in front of me.

1268
01:18:11,116 --> 01:18:14,916
He told me to for 50 dollars.
That is a lie. I did nothing of the kind!

1269
01:18:14,917 --> 01:18:17,417
If we're all going to tell the truth,
I may as well confess.

1270
01:18:17,418 --> 01:18:20,018
It was I who did it.
You?

1271
01:18:20,019 --> 01:18:22,919
I never say you before. It was he!

1272
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:26,620
Wait a minute! What is this?
That is a dress, madame.

1273
01:18:26,621 --> 01:18:29,321
Well, I can see it's a dress.
Let me look at it.

1274
01:18:29,322 --> 01:18:32,222
Why, Madeline, this must be one of yours.

1275
01:18:33,723 --> 01:18:35,923
I will notify the police.

1276
01:18:37,224 --> 01:18:40,424
I'm going to call an officer...
No... Mother, think of the neighbors.

1277
01:18:40,425 --> 01:18:42,625
Oh, no, madame. It was given to me.

1278
01:18:42,626 --> 01:18:44,526
Who gave it to you?
This lady.

1279
01:18:44,527 --> 01:18:47,327
She gave it to you?
Ha, that's a good one.

1280
01:18:48,628 --> 01:18:51,528
Did you not, madame?
I never saw it before in my life.

1281
01:18:51,529 --> 01:18:54,829
Oh, get the girl out of here.
What difference does it make where she got it?

1282
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:56,130
It doesn't belong to any of you.

1283
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:58,331
But why should she insist that you gave it to her?

1284
01:18:58,332 --> 01:18:59,399
Well, how do I know?

1285
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:03,700
That's what I'd like to know. Maybe Andrews can help us.
Andrews can do nothing of the kind.

1286
01:19:03,701 --> 01:19:05,101
There's no harm in asking him.

1287
01:19:05,102 --> 01:19:09,002
Why ask a dumb person?
Now we'll all hear something.

1288
01:19:10,403 --> 01:19:12,800
Did you ring, mam?
Yes, Andrews.

1289
01:19:12,801 --> 01:19:14,701
Have you ever seen this lady before?

1290
01:19:14,702 --> 01:19:17,202
Yes, mam, two of her.
Two of her?

1291
01:19:17,203 --> 01:19:20,903
Twice.
When and where did you see her?

1292
01:19:23,204 --> 01:19:25,004
Shall I tell the truth, Mr. Smith?

1293
01:19:25,005 --> 01:19:27,205
Why, of course, you fool!

1294
01:19:29,306 --> 01:19:32,006
She called this morning. In fact, I let her in.

1295
01:19:32,007 --> 01:19:35,207
Well, there you are, you see?
Somebody had to let her in.

1296
01:19:37,208 --> 01:19:38,708
Had you ever seen her before that?

1297
01:19:38,709 --> 01:19:40,609
Yes, last night.

1298
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:44,210
And if you ask me, it was the worst night in history.

1299
01:19:44,211 --> 01:19:48,111
Last night is not of my business. But did not madame
come here this morning in this gown?

1300
01:19:48,112 --> 01:19:51,012
Yes... something like that, I guess, yes.

1301
01:19:51,013 --> 01:19:54,213
Musette, let me see that dress.
Oui, monsieur.

1302
01:19:57,415 --> 01:19:59,999
Why, Diane, this is one of yours.

1303
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:04,900
So, you little homebody.
You weren't home at all last night.

1304
01:20:04,901 --> 01:20:07,001
No.
Who were you out with?

1305
01:20:07,002 --> 01:20:09,902
Oh...
Who were you out with?

1306
01:20:09,903 --> 01:20:11,703
Oh...
Tell me!

1307
01:20:12,104 --> 01:20:13,904
I was out with him.

1308
01:20:15,205 --> 01:20:16,405
So!

1309
01:20:19,606 --> 01:20:22,106
Dickie, you scoundrel you!

1310
01:20:22,107 --> 01:20:25,107
How perfectly ridiculous!
How could I possibly be out with her?

1311
01:20:25,108 --> 01:20:27,808
Wasn't I locked up with you in that room
the whole night long?

1312
01:20:27,809 --> 01:20:31,409
No! I knew from the very first it wasn't you.
Yes...

1313
01:20:32,310 --> 01:20:34,810
You knew? And yet you let him stay?

1314
01:20:34,811 --> 01:20:38,111
Mama!
Oh, you, you female of a specie...

1315
01:20:39,212 --> 01:20:41,312
And you! You'll pay for this!

1316
01:20:41,313 --> 01:20:43,013
Wait, wait, let me explain!

1317
01:20:43,014 --> 01:20:45,214
Explain? You've explained enough!

1318
01:20:55,315 --> 01:20:56,615
Don't shoot!

1319
01:20:56,616 --> 01:21:00,216
I love him!
Stop him! Stop him!

1320
01:21:07,517 --> 01:21:09,517
Next time he comes around, stop him!

1321
01:21:09,518 --> 01:21:11,318
Did you hear what he said?
Why don't you stop him?

1322
01:21:44,819 --> 01:21:47,219
Now! You'll do some explaining to me, you!

1323
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:04,020
Diane! Diane! Mr. Smith!

1324
01:22:07,321 --> 01:22:08,721
Open this door!

1325
01:22:08,722 --> 01:22:11,722
O Dickie, please.
Please let me tell you the truth about last night.

1326
01:22:12,723 --> 01:22:14,023
What are you doing in there?

1327
01:22:20,824 --> 01:22:22,324
Come on, you gottta get out of here!

1328
01:22:22,325 --> 01:22:24,825
Oh, I'm afraid.
Well, let me go.

1329
01:22:24,826 --> 01:22:27,626
Wait a minute, never mind, I'll do it.

1330
01:22:37,227 --> 01:22:38,227
Diane!

1331
01:22:38,228 --> 01:22:40,128
If you didn't make it, don't tell me.

1332
01:22:40,429 --> 01:22:44,429
Did you make it?
Yeah, I made it all right.

1333
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:58,130
Oh, no you don't. Not on me you don't.

1334
01:22:58,131 --> 01:23:00,331
You got that 50 bucks?
No.

1335
01:23:00,332 --> 01:23:01,932
Well, come on back in now.

1336
01:23:04,133 --> 01:23:06,733
Did you hear that crash?
He's beating her.

1337
01:23:06,734 --> 01:23:08,834
Courage, Diane! Courage!

1338
01:23:08,835 --> 01:23:11,735
Diane, don't let him do it!
Diane! Courage!

1339
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:15,136
Hey! You!

1340
01:23:15,137 --> 01:23:17,537
I'm seeing things again! I am!

1341
01:23:21,938 --> 01:23:23,438
Probably got out through the window.

1342
01:23:23,638 --> 01:23:25,338
Diane. Where have you been?

1343
01:23:25,339 --> 01:23:27,839
I caught this young lady trying to make a getaway.

1344
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:30,340
Hey, now, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1345
01:23:30,341 --> 01:23:33,541
She's my fare and she don't get out of here
till she come across.

1346
01:23:33,542 --> 01:23:37,642
I've been riding this dame around since 12 o'clock
last night.

1347
01:23:37,643 --> 01:23:39,643
I picked her up at the Whoopie Club.

1348
01:23:39,644 --> 01:23:42,944
And I was with her.
Yeah, that's right. You was with her.

1349
01:23:42,945 --> 01:23:46,545
I let you out at the subway station.
Driver! Was there a man along?

1350
01:23:46,546 --> 01:23:48,346
Yes, mam.
Your husband.

1351
01:23:48,347 --> 01:23:49,447
You're fired!

1352
01:23:49,448 --> 01:23:50,448
There!

1353
01:23:50,449 --> 01:23:53,349
Oh, I remember him.

1354
01:23:53,350 --> 01:23:55,350
That's the guy that was with'em.

1355
01:23:55,351 --> 01:23:57,851
That's the guy that I let out at the Union Club.

1356
01:23:58,952 --> 01:24:02,352
And she's been alone ever since?
Yes, sir.

1357
01:24:05,653 --> 01:24:06,853
Oh, thanks.

1358
01:24:06,854 --> 01:24:10,054
I didn't dare go home. I had to come here for money
for the taxi.

1359
01:24:10,055 --> 01:24:13,555
Oh, you poor kid.
You poor kid.

1360
01:24:13,556 --> 01:24:15,256
Shut up!

1361
01:24:15,257 --> 01:24:17,857
You don't want a divorce now at all,
do you, darling?

1362
01:24:18,858 --> 01:24:20,858
No!
But I do!

1363
01:24:21,459 --> 01:24:23,459
I'm the only injured party.

1364
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:26,760
You let him stay!
You let him stay!

1365
01:24:26,761 --> 01:24:29,461
Of course. I knew the minute I kissed him
he wasn't you.

1366
01:24:29,462 --> 01:24:32,062
Well, what did you do?
Well, as soon as I was positive...

1367
01:24:32,063 --> 01:24:34,063
I demanded the reason for the impersonation.

1368
01:24:34,064 --> 01:24:35,464
And I told her.

1369
01:24:35,465 --> 01:24:38,265
You told her?
It was either that or go to jail.

1370
01:24:38,266 --> 01:24:42,666
Oh, Dickie, it was such a gorgeous chance
to cure you of your blooming habit.

1371
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:49,167
She went into her room, darling.
I locked the connecting door.

1372
01:24:49,168 --> 01:24:51,568
Yes?
And prayed for the best.

1373
01:24:51,569 --> 01:24:54,769
Aw, sweetheart, if you will forgive me this time...

1374
01:24:54,770 --> 01:24:58,470
I promise you I'll never bloom again
as long as I live.

1375
01:24:58,471 --> 01:25:01,271
Well, I'm sure glad I'm not married.

1376
01:25:01,272 --> 01:25:04,172
Well, thank heaven all my husbands are dead.

1377
01:25:08,673 --> 01:25:14,673
