1
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,600
Well, home from the movies at last.

2
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,000
Looks like it, Aunt Mattle.

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,666
Hi, Dad!

4
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,900
Hello, Son!

5
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,200
Well, daughter, how was
the movie pictured tonight?

6
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,000
Hmm.
Lovely.

7
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:10,000
Right, that's what it
was. Just a lot of mud.

8
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,080
There wasn't anybody
killed in the whole thing.

9
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,900
No, well then, I'll stick
to these, these don't talk.

10
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,933
Well, that big clock, Norman
Maine was in the pictures tonight,

11
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,300
he never does anything
but kiss a lot of girls.

12
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,780
Norman Maine, is one of
the best actors in pictures.

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,100
You and your movies.
That's all that you think about.

14
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,200
You shouldn't be allowed to
go to them at all, if you ask me.

15
00:02:28,766 --> 00:02:30,900
Too bad I was so busy in the kitchen.

16
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,100
And I didn't hear anybody asking you.

17
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,066
Hello, Granny!

18
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
Hello, Darling

19
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,066
And off course no one ever listens to me!

20
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:40,133
They do if they're within ten miles of ya.

21
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,733
Gathering around picture shows,

22
00:02:42,066 --> 00:02:44,033
house all covered up with movies magazines.

23
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,366
And the other day I caught her
talking to a horse with a Swedish accent!

24
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:48,433
Well, Sis...

25
00:02:49,566 --> 00:02:51,200
you're only young once, you know?

26
00:02:53,566 --> 00:02:54,566
Ah!

27
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,300
Hollywood!

28
00:02:57,083 --> 00:03:00,375
You'd better be getting yourself a good
husband and stop mooning about Hollywood.

29
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,100
You know what she wants to do?

30
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,200
She wants to go to Hollywood!

31
00:03:05,366 --> 00:03:07,133
I've noted all along.

32
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,566
I've seen her making faces in
the mirror and talking to herself

33
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:12,800
That's what comes of your movies!

34
00:03:13,966 --> 00:03:16,966
Why? What would you do
if you did go to Hollywood?

35
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,500
I'd be an actress.

36
00:03:18,633 --> 00:03:19,633
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

37
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,700
I would, I tell ya, I've
always known I could.

38
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,433
Guys, wouldn't it be wonderful to have a movie star in
the family? Oh, Miss Blodgett, may I have your autograph?

39
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,000
You may not know it Aleck, but
you're practically on your way to bed.

40
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:34,900
Oh, Miss Blodgett you're my favorite actress,
wouldn't you tell me the secret of your success?

41
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,100
Oh, let me alone!

42
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,266
Why Esther, what's come over you?

43
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,900
I'll tell you what's come over her.

44
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,500
She's just a silly little girl whose
head is been turned by the movies

45
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,400
And as soon as she forgets the
whole thing, the better off she'll be.

46
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,900
Oh, why will I be better off?

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,700
What's wrong with want to go out and make something
of myself? What do you do that's so much better?

48
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,400
Just because you're satisfied to sit here
all your life, you think you can laugh at me!

49
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,100
Well, some day you won't laugh at me! I'm going
out and have a real life! I'm gonna be somebody!

50
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:10,400
Now if it was spring, I'd say give her
a good dose of sulfur and molasses.

51
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,066
I thought I'd find you up.

52
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,400
Oh, stop that!

53
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,900
Now stop crying! that isn't
going to do you a bit good.

54
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:25,033
I'm crying because Aunt
Mattie and Aleck make so mad.

55
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,100
Well, it's your aunt Mattie, Aleck.
They're not important.

56
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,866
You're the only one that counts.

57
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,766
Esther, everyone in this world who
has ever dreamed about better things

58
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,375
has been laughed at, don't you know that?

59
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,000
Oh, I suppose I do, but...

60
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:42,666
But there's a difference
between dreaming and doing.

61
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,166
The dreamers just sit around and moon

62
00:04:45,233 --> 00:04:47,300
about how wonderful it would be

63
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,433
if only things were different.

64
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,600
And the years roll on and they grow old

65
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,466
and by and by they forget everything,

66
00:04:56,066 --> 00:04:57,700
even about their dreams.

67
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,700
I don't want to be like that,
I want to be somebody,

68
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Oh yes, oh yes.

69
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:03,133
You want to be somebody,

70
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,600
but you want it to be easy.

71
00:05:04,866 --> 00:05:07,400
Oh, you modern girls give me a pain!

72
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,566
When I wanted something better,

73
00:05:09,766 --> 00:05:13,700
I came across those planes in
the prairies... with your Grandfather.

74
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,666
Oh, everyone laughed at us, like
they did with the other pioneers.

75
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,720
They said this country will never
be anything but a wilderness.

76
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:22,583
We didn't believe that.

77
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,900
We were going to make a new country.

78
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:26,833
Besides,

79
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,600
we wanted to see our dreams come true.

80
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,566
Oh Granny, it must have been wonderful.

81
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,066
It was wonderful.

82
00:05:34,566 --> 00:05:38,366
But don't you think for one single
minute that it was easy, Esther Blodgett.

83
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:42,042
We burned in summer and we froze in winter.

84
00:05:42,266 --> 00:05:44,900
But we kept right on going
and we didn't complain.

85
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,266
Because we were doing what we wanted to do!

86
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,533
Can you understand that?

87
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:52,966
Yes, I can.

88
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,000
Could you do it?

89
00:05:57,433 --> 00:05:59,600
Could you do it even
if it broke your heart?

90
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,533
Because remember Esther,

91
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,733
for every dream of yours
you make come true,

92
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:06,200
you'll pay the price in heartbreak.

93
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,400
I know what I'm talking about.

94
00:06:12,558 --> 00:06:13,750
You may not believe it,

95
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,042
but I was a young girl once.

96
00:06:16,923 --> 00:06:18,409
A very pretty young girl,

97
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,100
a lot prettier than you are.

98
00:06:21,766 --> 00:06:23,666
I was in love with your grandfather,

99
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:26,733
and when some indian
devil put a bullet through him,

100
00:06:27,433 --> 00:06:30,066
I felt like it had come
straight through my heart too.

101
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,466
I remembered all he taught me

102
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,756
and I went right on him.

103
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:37,433
I buried him out there on that wilderness

104
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,500
with my own hands.

105
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,466
I went right on that same day

106
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,800
And I kept right on the way,

107
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,000
even when your mother was born.

108
00:06:48,266 --> 00:06:51,966
Oh Granny, I would make it worthwhile.

109
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,300
You know, Esther,

110
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,433
there'll always be a wilderness to conquer.

111
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,633
Maybe Hollywood is your wilderness now.

112
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,600
From all I hear,

113
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,200
it sounds like it.

114
00:07:07,566 --> 00:07:10,100
But if you've got one drop
of my blood in your veins,

115
00:07:10,966 --> 00:07:14,266
you won't let Mattie or any
of her kind break your heart,

116
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:17,600
you'll go right out there
and break it yourself.

117
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,333
That's your right.

118
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,266
Here.

119
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,333
Oh, here, here, stop that nonsense.

120
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:27,666
Here.

121
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,500
Take this and go to your Hollywood.

122
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,000
Oh, I can't take you money.

123
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,866
Well, why not?

124
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:32,933
It's your savings!

125
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,000
Well, I was only saving up for my funeral.

126
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:37,366
Now I don't think I'm ever going to die.

127
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,066
Oh, granny, how can I ever thank you?

128
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:43,400
By giving me your word of honor
that you'll never tell a living soul

129
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,900
where you got that money.

130
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:45,833
I promise.

131
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:48,233
Remember, if you do,

132
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:50,653
I'll have you arrested for robbing me.

133
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,000
Here we are.

134
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,420
Want me to help you, Granny?

135
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:03,700
Oh, I can make it, Dear.

136
00:08:05,433 --> 00:08:06,000
Oh!

137
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Man, it's cold, uh.

138
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,533
I kissed Dad goodbye,
just a little kiss, he didn't even wake up.

139
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,376
I bet you didn't try that
on your Aunt Mattie.

140
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,433
Oh, Aunt Mattie...

141
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,876
Think of her face when you tell her.

142
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,200
I am thinking about it.

143
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,100
I've waited for that
chance for thirty years.

144
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,100
Fresh air

145
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:24,433
Oh, thank you Grelsy.
Girls, eh?

146
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,866
Come on, come on!

147
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,366
Look, there is you train.

148
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,533
All aboard!

149
00:08:47,233 --> 00:08:48,466
Oh, Granny!

150
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:52,733
Come on, come on! go on! go on!

151
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:55,750
Good bye Granny!

152
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Good bye!

153
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,600
I'll be waiting for you in
those movies pictures.

154
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
And don't tell Mattie,

155
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:04,200
you know my eyes are not
as good as they used to be,

156
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,000
But my ears are alright.

157
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,900
So you remember, talk up good and loud.

158
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,733
All aboard!

159
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:15,033
Goodbye!

160
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,500
Goodbye!

161
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,300
Goodbye Granny!

162
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Goodbye.

163
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,866
Do you want to go home now?

164
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
I don't want to

165
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,766
but I will.

166
00:11:35,766 --> 00:11:36,766
Good Afternoon.

167
00:11:38,408 --> 00:11:39,742
Day, week or month?

168
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,242
But it's a little hard to say you see,

169
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,700
I'm going into the movies.

170
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,276
Well you better take it for a week,

171
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,400
it'll break your jump to Beverly Hills.

172
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,500
Are all the studios really near here?

173
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,566
All except Gramon British.

174
00:11:53,325 --> 00:11:56,575
I suppose the best way to get a job
is to go straight to the studios, isn't it?

175
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,276
I have many illusions you know, I
am perfectly willing to begin with...

176
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,380
ooh a little bit of a part,

177
00:12:01,533 --> 00:12:02,633
or even as an extra.

178
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,208
$6 please

179
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,300
in advance.

180
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:06,833
Oh.

181
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:55,633
I beg your pardon,

182
00:12:56,653 --> 00:12:58,458
I'd like to register for extra work.

183
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,940
How long have you been in Hollywood?

184
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:02,866
Well, it's about a month now.

185
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:06,100
We haven't put anyone on
our books for over two years.

186
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:09,666
Come here,

187
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,208
I'd like to show you something.

188
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,766
- Try later.
- No can't be, try later.

189
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,033
- Try later, thank you.
- Not now, try later.

190
00:13:26,766 --> 00:13:30,086
Every time you see one of those little
lights flash it's somebody asking for a job.

191
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,142
Every time you hear them say: "Try later",

192
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,733
it means there isn't any job.

193
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,833
Can't keep the girls at the
switchboard long, they'd go crazy.

194
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,346
Every one of those little lights
thought it was going to be a star.

195
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,866
Still wanna go in the movies?

196
00:13:51,042 --> 00:13:52,333
You know what your chances are?

197
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,042
One in a hundred thousand.

198
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:03,966
Maybe...

199
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:05,833
I'm that one.

200
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,033
Any phone calls for me, Mr. Randall?

201
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Oh, no.

202
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,533
Jesse L. Lasky and Sammy Goldwyn
must be writting letters instead.

203
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,083
How was the luck today?

204
00:14:30,292 --> 00:14:31,292
There wasn't any.

205
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,000
Maybe you don't go at in the right way

206
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,800
Now take Danny McGuire here, he
knows the ropes. Don't you Danny?

207
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:39,933
Sure, I've had 'em
around my neck for years.

208
00:14:44,966 --> 00:14:45,300
What?

209
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,400
Oh, Miss Blodgett,

210
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,125
Danny McGuire, our new tenant

211
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,750
How do you do?

212
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,083
Mr. McGuire is a...

213
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
big director.

214
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:57,750
Oh.

215
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,466
Are you really?

216
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,033
Oh, could you possibly use
me in a picture, Mr. McGuire?

217
00:15:04,566 --> 00:15:06,500
Of course I haven't had much experience but

218
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:08,900
I don't think that really
matters if you're willing.

219
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:09,833
- And I'm...

220
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:10,866
Now listen, lady.

221
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:14,700
In the first place I'm not a
director, I'm an assistant director

222
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:16,166
and the second place

223
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,933
if I had any jobs to give away,
I'd confirm one of them myself.

224
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,800
And in the third place, you should
have stayed back home in the first place!

225
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:30,766
Oh, no! Look what you've done.

226
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,533
Hey, wait a minute!

227
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:34,733
Hey, don't be that way!

228
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Don't do that.

229
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,133
Gosh, I didn't mean to get tough.

230
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,800
A guy thinks he's being kidded when

231
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,833
somebody asking for a job and,

232
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,500
he hasn't got one for himself.

233
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:56,167
After all, I'm not a big enough shot to

234
00:15:56,366 --> 00:15:57,366
hurt your feelings.

235
00:15:57,533 --> 00:15:58,766
I'm sorry.

236
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,458
It wasn't just that, oh,
it was a lot of things.

237
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,733
I've been for a job everyday
and never getting any nearer to it.

238
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,255
I guess I was beginning
to get a little scared.

239
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,100
I know.

240
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,333
Lady, do I know.

241
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,333
Well, There's only one thing
to do when you're feeling

242
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,866
tired and sunk and
down to your last nickle.

243
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:18,366
Come on and I'll buy you a drink.

244
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:20,700
Well its not as bad as
down to the last nickle

245
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,333
I've still got $11 left.

246
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,033
$11 dollars!

247
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,933
You're gonna buy me a drink! Come on!

248
00:16:33,766 --> 00:16:34,766
That's right George

249
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,433
there's nothing like a little rum to

250
00:16:36,466 --> 00:16:38,066
take away that milk flavor.

251
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:48,866
I beg your pardon.

252
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:50,033
Certainly.

253
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,076
And when I sign my contract, the first thing I'm gonna
do is see that you direct every picture that I'm in.

254
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,533
Thats my pal!

255
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:07,326
Of course I'm going to be
perfectly nice about it, but

256
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,700
I'll just insist.

257
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,208
Now that's the way to talk.

258
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:15,292
Don't let 'em lick ya.

259
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,400
They can't lick me,

260
00:17:16,533 --> 00:17:17,900
If they anything like that well,

261
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,600
I just won't sign.

262
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,262
Now that's right.
What have you got to lose?

263
00:17:26,108 --> 00:17:29,441
Another one of these and
we'll open our own studio.

264
00:17:36,066 --> 00:17:36,766
Bill rendered,

265
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:38,133
twenty four dollars.

266
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:39,733
Past due.

267
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,400
Remit without further delay.

268
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,600
<u>Me.</u>

269
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,833
Poor kid.

270
00:17:54,933 --> 00:17:58,000
If she can't pay the bills she gets

271
00:17:58,900 --> 00:17:59,900
No.

272
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:21,266
Fifth race, fifth race, I
can't... I can't believe it...

273
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:41,962
Hey! The program is gonna be swell tonight.

274
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:44,100
Now you take this fella Beethoven:

275
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,733
I'm a pushover for him.

276
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And Chopin -

277
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,933
well, he's not so dusty, either.

278
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,333
But I kinda wish that once in awhile that

279
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,966
play something you
could sorta go out whistling.

280
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,266
You know, like "Blood
on the saddle, blood on..."

281
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:00,766
well now there's a tune

282
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,976
Hey, why don't you throw your hat
in the air or something. Can't you?

283
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,366
But this is a celebration,
my job starts tomorrow

284
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,700
I know it does, and I
think it's swell, Danny.

285
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:11,333
Gee, I wish you were in on it too.

286
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:14,400
But oh no, it would
have to be a war picture.

287
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:18,775
A big novelty number. The war picture
without any beautiful women at the front.

288
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,100
Oh well, something'll happen soon.

289
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:22,233
Maybe.

290
00:19:23,766 --> 00:19:25,300
Why don't you go home kid?

291
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,133
Oh Danny, I can't do that.

292
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,300
I came here and I've got to stay.

293
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:32,873
Well now, if it's on
account of money I can...

294
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,666
Thank you but you given enough already

295
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,700
Anyhow this is no time to
be worrying, this is a party!

296
00:19:39,933 --> 00:19:41,433
Look at all the people.

297
00:19:41,633 --> 00:19:43,700
Everybody in the world,

298
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,300
Look

299
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:49,500
That's Norman Maine

300
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,433
seems to have had that one extra cocktail

301
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,500
Oh, Thank you.

302
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,300
Sit down you dope that's
for the orchestra leader.

303
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,500
Hello...
Hello, Norman.

304
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,033
Oh, Mr. Maine, Mr. Maine,

305
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:30,100
Put your arm around Miss Regis.

306
00:20:30,233 --> 00:20:33,133
Arlow, this is the Hollywood Bowl.

307
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,000
Oh, afraid of crowds?

308
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,833
Go ahead, go on, Get outta here!

309
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:40,353
What's the matter? You getting
too big to bother with photographers?

310
00:20:40,466 --> 00:20:42,533
Don't want any pictures taken now.

311
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,033
Oh is that so? Well
supposing I take it anyway

312
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,000
I'll shove that Brownie Number
2 of yours down your throat.

313
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,500
Thank you! Mr. Maine!

314
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,800
No! Stop it!

315
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:54,133
No!

316
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,066
Stop it!

317
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,500
No, Stop!

318
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,100
Come on!

319
00:20:58,766 --> 00:20:59,766
Take it easy, Mr. Maine!

320
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,666
Hey, take your hands off.

321
00:21:00,766 --> 00:21:01,766
Calm down, please.

322
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,566
Norman! come back and sit
down everybody's laughing at you.

323
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:13,833
Alright, already...

324
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,900
Hi, Norman.

325
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:18,433
Is he always like that?

326
00:21:19,075 --> 00:21:21,433
Well, I suppose he has to sleep sometime.

327
00:21:21,533 --> 00:21:23,966
Oh and he is so wonderful on the screen.

328
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,500
And thanks again, dear
Granny, for the money -

329
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,733
but you mustn't keep sending it.

330
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,833
Everything is going beautifully now.

331
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,133
In fact, Daniel McGuire, the director,

332
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,300
says I'm certain to get a job very soon.

333
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,600
Come in.

334
00:21:59,233 --> 00:22:00,233
Hello, Danny.

335
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
What's the matter?

336
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:05,033
Belive it or not, I've got a job for you.

337
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,100
Ah!

338
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,000
Danny, that's wonderful!
When do I go to the studio?

339
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:12,000
Well, you don't exactly
know there's a studio.

340
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,233
Oh! It's on location.

341
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,200
No, it's not exactly on location.

342
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:18,909
Of course I haven't any makeup. Will you tell
me what to get and sort of help me put it on?

343
00:22:18,933 --> 00:22:20,900
Well, you don't exactly need any makeup,

344
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,433
you see it's not really a picture job

345
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,666
it's, it's well it's being a waitress.

346
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,600
Oh.

347
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:33,725
Well it's kind of a picture
job if you look at it right.

348
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,333
But you said it was a waitress.

349
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,532
Well, it's waitressing for Casey Burt.

350
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:41,833
He's a big director over at our
studio, he's giving a party tonight

351
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,633
to kind of celebrate on
account of finishing the picture

352
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:48,475
and he wanted me to get him
an extra waitress and it's 5 dollars.

353
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,905
And I thought of you right away, Esther.

354
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
That was awfully sweet of you Danny.

355
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,800
Well,

356
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:57,566
They're gonna be a lot of
big people at Burke's house

357
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,700
I'll bet you there's any
number of big directors

358
00:23:00,066 --> 00:23:02,000
and if you're there
maybe they'll notice you.

359
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:05,966
I could make them notice me.

360
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,400
Sure you could Ester! It's your chance!

361
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,400
My chance.

362
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,266
Alright Danny I'll do it, oh

363
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,900
but I can't, I haven't got
the right things to wear.

364
00:23:17,133 --> 00:23:18,733
Oh! Oh! Here!

365
00:23:22,333 --> 00:23:25,813
You don't think the wardrobe department is
right next to my office for nothing, do you?

366
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:28,475
Haha a perfect fit!

367
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,700
Did you get to the preview last night?

368
00:23:45,866 --> 00:23:46,866
I did.

369
00:23:49,725 --> 00:23:52,808
Vould you like a little hors d'oeuvre?

370
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,333
They are very nice.

371
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,100
Well thanks.

372
00:23:57,683 --> 00:23:59,043
What did you think of the picture?

373
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,276
You should have saved it for Thanksgiving.

374
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,300
What a turkey!

375
00:24:09,466 --> 00:24:12,633
Will you have some hors d'oeuvres?
You do like hors d'oeuvres don't you?

376
00:24:12,766 --> 00:24:16,666
I don't think there's anything so
enjoyable as hors d'oeuvres before supper

377
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,200
And these are really delightful.

378
00:24:30,475 --> 00:24:33,435
And at the finish, the kid turns
around and sings a lullaby to its mother.

379
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,300
Pardon me, big boy

380
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,866
but, would you like a
little, hors d'oeuvres?

381
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,266
They say they're the best.

382
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:43,133
In town.

383
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:44,233
Don't tell me.

384
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,466
I know.

385
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,600
Mae West.

386
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,766
That's a great twist! But where are you gonna
find a two month old baby that can sing?

387
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,733
Hello, Oliver!

388
00:24:54,866 --> 00:24:55,866
Oh, hello Casey!

389
00:24:56,392 --> 00:24:58,432
Wanna fire me now or
wait till you see the picture?

390
00:24:58,966 --> 00:25:00,466
I'm not a director anymore I'm a...

391
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:01,933
male nurse!

392
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,709
What's the matter with the picture?

393
00:25:03,733 --> 00:25:05,166
A guy by the name of Norman Main

394
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,766
His work is beginning to
interfere with his drinking.

395
00:25:10,633 --> 00:25:11,100
Oliver,

396
00:25:11,466 --> 00:25:14,500
don't tell me I'm to direct his next picture, too.
- Mhm

397
00:25:15,833 --> 00:25:17,466
You were my favorite producer.

398
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,250
Now wait a minute, you just
go right on with your directing.

399
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:21,933
I'll take care of these stars.

400
00:25:22,142 --> 00:25:23,225
I know how to handle them.

401
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,533
I had a serious talk with Norman after that
Hollywood Bowl occurrence.

402
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,060
And you not have to worry
any more about his behavior.

403
00:25:29,233 --> 00:25:30,233
Excuse me, Mister Niles.

404
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,300
Mr Libby, of your publicity
department is on the telephone.

405
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:35,033
He says it's most important Sir.

406
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:36,633
It's about Mr. Maine.

407
00:25:37,033 --> 00:25:38,033
Thank you.

408
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,600
Oh, it's probably just some little thing.

409
00:25:42,892 --> 00:25:43,975
Of course, Oliver!

410
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,476
I´ll turn on the radio and see

411
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,566
If he's called out the National Guard yet.

412
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:50,793
Hello Libby, what´s the good word?

413
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,066
Mister Norman Maine,
America's prince charming,

414
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,600
Was apprehended driving an ambulance

415
00:25:57,766 --> 00:25:59,033
Down Wilshire Blvd!

416
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:01,475
With a siren going full blast

417
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:05,142
He explained he was a tree
surgeon on a maternity case.

418
00:26:05,633 --> 00:26:07,113
Well... er, will it be in the papers?

419
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:08,866
No it won't be in the papers.

420
00:26:09,433 --> 00:26:11,892
But that's a nice expensive hobby of yours.

421
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,633
Keeping Mr. Maine's informal
entertainment out of the public press.

422
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:18,900
Oh, that´s fine work Libby

423
00:26:19,233 --> 00:26:20,866
Try and see that no one gets to Norman.

424
00:26:21,233 --> 00:26:23,266
He's probably home sleeping it off.

425
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:27,575
Because you forgot those
dopes at the studio for one night

426
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,380
Business, business all the time.

427
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,075
I dont know what´s gonna become of you

428
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,466
Norman!

429
00:26:35,242 --> 00:26:36,700
Why didn't you call for me?

430
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:39,166
Oh my darling why didn't I call for you?

431
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,733
In case you've forgotten, I was
supposed to come here with you.

432
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:45,253
Oh that old hat's alright, I
got here without any trouble.

433
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,340
The only reason I don't slap your face...

434
00:26:47,533 --> 00:26:49,400
Yes, yes, darling. I-I know.

435
00:26:50,158 --> 00:26:51,158
Hello John!

436
00:26:51,233 --> 00:26:52,000
Oh. Hello, Norman!

437
00:26:52,001 --> 00:26:54,441
What's the matter with Oliver?
He looks as if he got bad news.

438
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,533
Hello!

439
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:57,533
Hello Larry.

440
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,280
What's the matter, old boy?

441
00:27:01,066 --> 00:27:01,900
Maybe I'm wrong.

442
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,542
I guess I've been drinking too much lately.

443
00:27:03,566 --> 00:27:05,366
Oh you ought to cut
that down, it's bad stuff

444
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Scotch and soda

445
00:27:12,984 --> 00:27:14,145
Come on, come on, come on.

446
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,800
The word you know, is pronounced 'when'.

447
00:27:17,867 --> 00:27:19,200
Bad dialog Oliver.

448
00:27:19,908 --> 00:27:20,988
Would rather not watch this

449
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:23,466
You know best

450
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:25,242
Soda!

451
00:27:27,066 --> 00:27:28,233
Thank you!

452
00:27:29,466 --> 00:27:30,466
Uh.

453
00:27:33,325 --> 00:27:34,325
Go ahead and say it.

454
00:27:34,533 --> 00:27:35,533
Got it coming to me.

455
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:37,600
Don't make it tougher on me Norman.

456
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,276
I don't want to stand here and preach,

457
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,266
but take a look at my side of it,
I'm trying to make pictures with you

458
00:27:42,466 --> 00:27:43,466
I know, I know.

459
00:27:43,617 --> 00:27:45,825
Costs are going up and
the grosses are going down.

460
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:46,833
No, it isn't that.

461
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:48,233
I made lots of money with you.

462
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:49,813
And I can afford to take a loss,

463
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,009
but I hate to see you going
the way of so many others.

464
00:27:52,033 --> 00:27:54,633
Why don't you get Lloyds
to insure you against me?

465
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,500
You can't get insurance against
a man forgetting who he is.

466
00:27:58,158 --> 00:28:02,468
You're a great star Norman, but there's nobody so big
they can afford to have people refuse to work with him.

467
00:28:02,492 --> 00:28:04,200
Who doesn't wanna work with me? You...

468
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:04,700
Quiet.

469
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,466
Listen, I know plenty people who do.

470
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,466
Yes and so do I

471
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,400
but your real friends can't stand
seeing you start to fall apart.

472
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:11,950
What do you mean by that?

473
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,666
First signs are always the same

474
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:15,533
not being able to remember your lines.

475
00:28:15,992 --> 00:28:17,776
Camera man struggling
to cover your hangovers

476
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,509
And all because you
have to have a good time...

477
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:20,700
every day and every night.

478
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,176
Listen I've warned you for a long time.

479
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,509
I know, Oliver you're a swell guy,

480
00:28:23,533 --> 00:28:25,700
you won't lose any money on me.
I'll promise you that.

481
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,700
I'll be ready for the curtains
when the time comes.

482
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
When it does,

483
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,666
Here's my epitaph.

484
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,800
Good for amusement only.

485
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,367
Now I think I'll um...

486
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,400
have another drink.

487
00:28:45,417 --> 00:28:46,417
Scotch and soda

488
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,000
Scotch and Soda.

489
00:28:59,424 --> 00:29:00,464
Come on, come on, come on.

490
00:29:04,866 --> 00:29:05,866
A little soda.

491
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,450
Caviar?

492
00:29:07,566 --> 00:29:08,000
No, thanks.

493
00:29:08,266 --> 00:29:09,800
Yes, um pardon me.

494
00:29:13,866 --> 00:29:14,966
Lovely, lovely.

495
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:17,633
I mean caviar.

496
00:29:18,533 --> 00:29:20,742
Oh don't, don't go away, I'm starving.

497
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,200
Which... which would you take?

498
00:29:26,867 --> 00:29:27,992
Oh, I don't know.

499
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,900
You don't know? I... I don 't know either.

500
00:29:30,742 --> 00:29:31,742
Hard to choose.

501
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,900
But I think I'll take, caviar.

502
00:29:34,133 --> 00:29:36,166
Mr. Maine doesn't care for anymore.

503
00:29:37,492 --> 00:29:38,492
Do you, Norman?

504
00:29:39,133 --> 00:29:40,133
No.

505
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,825
No, Normy doesn't care for anymore.

506
00:29:46,617 --> 00:29:48,908
I think I shall get very drunk indeed.

507
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,500
Scotch and soda.

508
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:58,766
Sorry, I have something.

509
00:30:14,783 --> 00:30:15,242
Oh.

510
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,950
Mind if I help you?

511
00:30:22,867 --> 00:30:23,867
Won't they miss you?

512
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:27,033
Oh no no, they'll just look under
the table and when they see

513
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,408
I'm not there they'll
forget the whole matter.

514
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,566
What... er?

515
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,333
What... what's your name?

516
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,800
Esther Blodgett.

517
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:38,166
My name is Maine.

518
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:39,000
I know.

519
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:40,333
You do?

520
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,700
What, What's so funny?

521
00:30:45,933 --> 00:30:47,733
I was just thinking about all your fans

522
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,940
and how surprised they'd be to see
you here helping me put plates away.

523
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,300
Oh they don't know my finest side.

524
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,900
They'd be pretty envious of me

525
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,666
meeting you this way in person.

526
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,966
Oh, how'd you do?

527
00:30:58,533 --> 00:30:59,800
So Tell me eh, eh,

528
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:02,033
Are you disappointed?

529
00:31:03,033 --> 00:31:04,033
Yes.

530
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:05,575
Oh.

531
00:31:06,075 --> 00:31:07,242
Now you've done it.

532
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:10,742
Oh never mind that, that
makes the room look lived in.

533
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,100
Tell me um

534
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:14,766
wh-

535
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:16,600
why are you disappointed?

536
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,700
I was sitting behind you,

537
00:31:18,866 --> 00:31:20,500
at the Hollywood Bowl the night you

538
00:31:20,867 --> 00:31:22,107
didn't want to be photographed.

539
00:31:24,617 --> 00:31:25,825
Oh.

540
00:31:26,658 --> 00:31:29,450
I'm told I crept in to
many a heart that night

541
00:31:29,766 --> 00:31:31,200
Oh I can never explain this.

542
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,266
You know you have very pretty hair.

543
00:31:33,366 --> 00:31:34,446
You better get out of here.

544
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,833
A sensitive mouth,

545
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,466
and a charming little-

546
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,160
Can't see why you're here
instead of with the rest of the guests

547
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,300
I was just trying to be helpful.

548
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
I see.

549
00:31:43,914 --> 00:31:45,908
Are you sure there's no other attraction?

550
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,558
Well it might be that my old mania for

551
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,900
putting plates away is coming back on me.

552
00:31:51,283 --> 00:31:53,450
It's rather odd. I always
know where I can find you.

553
00:31:53,633 --> 00:31:55,033
If there's a pretty girl around.

554
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,733
It's not only odd, it's embarrassing.

555
00:31:56,866 --> 00:31:58,586
You're being deliberately insulting Norman.

556
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,133
I put up with you for long enough-

557
00:31:59,166 --> 00:32:01,333
Now dear don't lose your temper.

558
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,866
Remember we must try to keep the voice low.

559
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,200
I know you'll excuse us
if we go on with our work.

560
00:32:22,166 --> 00:32:23,266
Now see what you've done!

561
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:31,700
Come here.

562
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,300
Help me up.

563
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:35,833
Are you hurt?

564
00:32:36,866 --> 00:32:38,200
No more than usual.

565
00:32:38,966 --> 00:32:40,709
Come on! The wolves are
on us we gotta get outta here.

566
00:32:40,733 --> 00:32:42,400
I can't! The dishes aren't finished!

567
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:45,117
Oh yes they are!

568
00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:55,866
Well,

569
00:32:58,366 --> 00:32:59,966
I bet I know what you're gonna say now.

570
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
What?

571
00:33:01,833 --> 00:33:02,833
Good night.

572
00:33:03,283 --> 00:33:04,617
Good night and thanks.

573
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,566
Hey wait a minute. Wait a minute.

574
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:08,599
Hey, Uh...

575
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,900
Here.

576
00:33:10,166 --> 00:33:11,166
You realize that

577
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,966
all I found out about you is that you're

578
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,220
foolish enough to want to go into pictures?

579
00:33:16,533 --> 00:33:18,117
Why the foolish, look at you.

580
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:20,200
Oh, that's what I mean.

581
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,200
No I'd

582
00:33:23,117 --> 00:33:26,450
I'd rather like to go into this
matter a little more thoroughly.

583
00:33:27,266 --> 00:33:28,866
Well that's awfully nice of you.

584
00:33:29,733 --> 00:33:30,733
Why um

585
00:33:31,466 --> 00:33:34,066
why don't we uh go on up to my place and

586
00:33:34,766 --> 00:33:35,900
talk it over?

587
00:33:36,333 --> 00:33:38,300
Oh, no.
Thank you very much, but

588
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,066
I really must say goodnight.

589
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,900
Goodnight.

590
00:33:44,633 --> 00:33:45,633
You're not angry.

591
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:46,733
No no no.

593
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,300
Well, why don't you go
and get something to eat?

594
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,233
Goodnight, Miss Blodgett.

595
00:33:56,233 --> 00:33:57,800
Goodnight, Mr. Maine.

596
00:33:59,133 --> 00:34:00,133
Wait a minute.

597
00:34:02,233 --> 00:34:04,500
Least I can do is to see you to your door.

598
00:34:07,066 --> 00:34:08,666
Will I see you again?

599
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:09,950
I hope so.

600
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,617
Has anyone ever told
you that you're lovely?

601
00:34:16,492 --> 00:34:17,492
Well, now you know.

602
00:34:18,666 --> 00:34:19,900
Thank you.

604
00:34:27,575 --> 00:34:28,742
It's hard to say, but I

605
00:34:29,533 --> 00:34:30,600
I wanna say it anyway.

606
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,566
You know I'm a, I'm a screen, I'm a

607

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,866
In private life, I'm a

609

610
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,900
but whatever I do I

611
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,533
still respect lovely things.

612
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,600
And you're lovely.

613

Yes, I think I do.

the head that's doing this

to give her a screen test.

wonderful possibilities.

00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:01,233
Ready Miss uh, what's your name.

718
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,933
He'll soon know your name, Esther.

719
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,700
The whole world's going to know it.

720
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,500
But I'm so scared.

721
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,909
Maybe I'd better not try today.

722
00:42:09,933 --> 00:42:12,800
Oh, come on, now don't be foolish.
They all had to go through this.

723
00:42:13,268 --> 00:42:15,404
Harlow, Lombard, Myrna Loy.

724
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:16,733
And now,

725
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,033
Esther Blodgett.

726
00:42:19,566 --> 00:42:20,566
Alright.

727
00:42:20,867 --> 00:42:21,867
I'm ready.

728
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,400
This is a take.

729
00:42:23,533 --> 00:42:24,533
Roll 'em.

730
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,800
Quiet!

731
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,100
Take

732
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,332
Oliver Niles Productions.

733
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:31,966
By Oliver Niles

734
00:42:32,033 --> 00:42:34,033
Esther Victoria Blodgett

735
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,242
I may as well tell you
that my whole organization

736
00:42:36,266 --> 00:42:37,533
thinks I've gone a little nuts

737
00:42:37,633 --> 00:42:38,633
to sign you.

738
00:42:39,867 --> 00:42:41,627
Maybe they are right,
I've been nuts before.

739
00:42:41,866 --> 00:42:42,533
You see,

740
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:46,633
All the experts seems to think that your type
is a little mild for present day's taste.

741
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:49,733
I'd rather believe that
tastes change, like eyebrows.

742
00:42:49,933 --> 00:42:52,966
And I think that also like eyebrows,
tastes are going back to the natural.

743
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,800
You look like a nice girl,

744
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:58,325
I think I'm going to like you.

745
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,700
That's not important.

746
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:03,166
I think the public will like you.

747
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,300
That is important.

748
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,866
Oh yes.

749
00:43:06,133 --> 00:43:08,066
I see what you mean,
I - I mean I know it is.

750
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:09,973
But you don't think it's going to be easy

751
00:43:10,367 --> 00:43:12,492
Nothing you really want
is ever given away free.

752
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:13,966
You have to pay for it.

753
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,000
And usually with your heart.

754
00:43:18,033 --> 00:43:19,566
Someone else told me that once.

755
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,180
But you still have to
work it out for yourself.

756
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,533
Oh well, all this is just
a long way of saying

757
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:27,676
I'm glad you're with
us, and good luck to you.

758
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,408
Now, I'm going to turn you over
to our demon press agent, Libby.

759
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,080
Don't let him frighten you.

760
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,300
He has a heart of gold...

761
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,600
only harder.

762
00:43:36,395 --> 00:43:37,492
And for the love of Pete,

763
00:43:37,533 --> 00:43:39,600
learn to close your
mouth and keep it closed.

764
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:41,283
Even in your love scenes.

765
00:43:54,533 --> 00:43:55,533
Are you a Russian?

766
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:58,366
No, I was born in Filmore North Dakota.

767
00:43:58,533 --> 00:43:59,533
Oh no.

768
00:44:01,233 --> 00:44:02,533
Grace saw light of day...

769
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,366
In a mountain cabin,

770
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:05,867
at trappers hut

771
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,133
High up in the rockies

772
00:44:09,507 --> 00:44:10,507
Go on.

773
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:13,200
Well, I always wanted to be an actress.

774
00:44:14,266 --> 00:44:15,466
Dreamed of footlights,

775
00:44:15,992 --> 00:44:17,450
as lonely kitty

776
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,640
Are you sure theres no
Russian in your family?

777
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,800
Positive.

778
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
That's a shame.

779
00:44:23,033 --> 00:44:24,533
Well, what does your father do?

780
00:44:25,117 --> 00:44:26,117
He's a farmer.

781
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,200
Eh..

782
00:44:27,867 --> 00:44:29,950
Social registeried Father

783
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,966
Fed up with hypocrisy

784
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,200
a 400...

785
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,500
sought wilderness for consolation.

786
00:44:36,658 --> 00:44:38,450
There amidst the mountain flowers.

787
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,233
He raised another blossom.

788
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,400
His lovely little daughter.

789
00:44:43,133 --> 00:44:44,133
What's your name?

790
00:44:44,633 --> 00:44:47,066
Esther Victoria Blodgett.

791
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,400
Greatly appreciating your
attention in this matter, very surely...

792
00:44:56,533 --> 00:44:58,100
do you know what her name is?

793
00:44:58,633 --> 00:45:01,933
Esther Victoria Blodgett.

794
00:45:03,566 --> 00:45:05,566
He will have to do something
about that right away

795
00:45:08,033 --> 00:45:10,783
Esther Victoria Blodgett

796
00:45:11,966 --> 00:45:13,666
Well, that Blodgett's definitely out.

797
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,000
Let's see, Esther Victoria

798
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,700
Victoria, Vicky. How about Vicky?

799
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,466
Oh I think that's terribly cute! let's

800
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:20,733

801
00:45:21,033 --> 00:45:22,333
Vicky Vicky. Pronounced.

802
00:45:22,617 --> 00:45:24,492
Vicky. Vicky.

803
00:45:27,633 --> 00:45:30,300
Siesta, besta, sesta, desta, festa...

804
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,633
Oh, that's very pretty.

805
00:45:34,733 --> 00:45:36,766
Hesta, hesta, Jesta, Lester, Vicky Lester!

806
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,966
Oh I like that!

807
00:45:38,133 --> 00:45:38,566
Say it!

808
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,266
Vicki Lester

809
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:39,966
Say it again.

810
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:40,600
Vicki Lester

811
00:45:40,867 --> 00:45:41,575
Say it again.

812
00:45:41,825 --> 00:45:42,665
Vicki Lester

813
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,233
Say it!

814
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,200
Vicki Lester

815
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:44,900
say Vicki Lester!

816
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:45,700
Vicki Lester

817
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:46,500
Vicki Lester

818
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,300
Vicki Lester

819
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,400
Vicki Lester!

820
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,166
Lester.

821
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,600
Franz

822
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,800
Oliver Nile Studio discovers new starlet.

823
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,333
A Cinderella of the Rockies

824
00:45:57,733 --> 00:45:59,666
Her name is Vicky Lester

825
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:00,900
Those who have peeked

826
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,200
tells me should couldn't be more divine

827
00:46:03,466 --> 00:46:06,000
The face of an angel
and such natural talent

828
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,766
Her voice is a symphony.

829
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,766
Her very walk, they tell me
is enough to drive men mad!

830
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,075
Not that way!

831
00:46:16,492 --> 00:46:18,617
Get the lead outta your feet! Lift them up!

832
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,117
That's better.

833
00:46:28,433 --> 00:46:29,800
It's terrible, but it's better.

834
00:46:31,325 --> 00:46:33,492
The quality of mercy is not strange

835
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:36,100
it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven

836
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:36,766
Cease.

837
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,100
Through the mouth, my
child. Through the mouth.

838
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,400
The nose is for smelling roses.

839
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:44,500
Proceed.

840
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,500
Does she have to look
surprised all the time?

841
00:46:57,533 --> 00:46:59,291
Anyway, it's just a rough sketch.

842
00:46:59,992 --> 00:47:01,367
Pretty small mouth eh?

843
00:47:05,966 --> 00:47:07,000
Oh well,

844
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,233
Give her that cloth a squeeze

845
00:47:09,666 --> 00:47:10,666
ooh

846
00:47:17,867 --> 00:47:20,325
This will give that xjssalhhfid

847
00:47:27,742 --> 00:47:29,117
We are on the wrong track,

848
00:47:29,766 --> 00:47:31,300
she still looks surprised.

849
00:47:36,242 --> 00:47:37,242
Listen drunk people

850
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,900
My shoes not on the step this morning

851
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:40,200
not in the camera

852
00:47:40,433 --> 00:47:41,600
now come on snap in to it!

853
00:47:45,685 --> 00:47:47,775
Acme trrrrucking company.

854
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:51,333
No, Mister Smith is not in!

855
00:47:58,033 --> 00:47:59,575
Acme trucking company.

856
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:01,400
No.

857
00:48:01,617 --> 00:48:04,158
Mister Smith is not in.

858
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,933
Good morning, what
can I bring you Mr. Maine?

859
00:48:15,133 --> 00:48:17,000
Just shows how long you've been here.

860
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,233
Never blushes.

861
00:48:19,266 --> 00:48:21,146
How soon are you and I
going to be married huh?

862
00:48:21,333 --> 00:48:22,366
I don't know.

863
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:24,367
You will have to ask my mother.

864
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Acme trucking company.

865
00:48:36,283 --> 00:48:39,658
No, Mister Smith is not in.

866
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,700
Acme trucking company.

867
00:48:45,133 --> 00:48:48,400
No, Mister Smith is not in.

868
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,200
Acme...

869
00:48:53,266 --> 00:48:54,966
Naw Shmith ain't in!

870
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,099
Acme trucking company.

871
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,142
I'd like to speak to Mr. Smith please.

872
00:49:09,166 --> 00:49:10,400
Mister Smith is not...

873
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,333
Oh, Norman!

874
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,042
What's all this between you and Smith?

875
00:49:14,066 --> 00:49:15,866
I got a part... It's only one line...

876
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
but it's in the Picture!

877
00:49:17,233 --> 00:49:19,933
So it's ambition that made you
break that date with me last night.

878
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:22,100
I had to be here so early this morning.

879
00:49:22,266 --> 00:49:23,266
Uh, so did I.

880
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,766
I had to stay up all night to make it.

881
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,640
You've started your picture, haven't you?

882
00:49:28,866 --> 00:49:31,100
No, no we are still in the testing stage.

883
00:49:31,533 --> 00:49:33,466
Can't seem to get the
right girl for the lead.

884
00:49:35,887 --> 00:49:37,376
Hmm..You'd think with
all the girls there are...

885
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,300
Yeah, well this one's got to be different.

886
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,266
She's got to be little,
and cute, and sweet,

887
00:49:42,992 --> 00:49:43,992
And intelligent.

888
00:49:46,133 --> 00:49:47,266
Well blow me down.

889
00:49:47,366 --> 00:49:47,733
What?

890
00:49:48,379 --> 00:49:50,158
Well close my tired old eyes,

891
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,033
Wha..what is it?

892
00:49:51,133 --> 00:49:52,200
Hold everything, come on.

893
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Come on!

894
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,509
Have you been through
the whole casting, Director?

895
00:50:00,533 --> 00:50:01,366
I'll work day and night Mr...

896
00:50:01,433 --> 00:50:02,633
And I'll work with her Oliver!

897
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,266
I can mean or nasty or
anything you want, Mr Niles.

898
00:50:05,533 --> 00:50:07,533
If she clicks Oliver,
you've got a star overnight.

899
00:50:10,133 --> 00:50:11,133
Ok.

900
00:50:48,666 --> 00:50:50,733
Wait till you hear them
at the end of the picture.

901
00:51:03,933 --> 00:51:06,100
When the world tripped politely

902
00:51:06,133 --> 00:51:08,300
to the genteel music of spinnets.

903
00:51:20,383 --> 00:51:21,543
Do you think we were noticed?

904
00:51:21,592 --> 00:51:24,353
No one... They're much
to busy playing at croquet.

905
00:51:26,966 --> 00:51:28,900
I have loved you all my life.

906
00:51:29,366 --> 00:51:31,533
But we have only met two days ago.

907
00:51:32,633 --> 00:51:34,866
That's when my life began.

908
00:51:58,733 --> 00:51:59,600
Ain't she cute?

909
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,576
You know I think she's the same
type I am. Don't you? I think she's sweet.

910
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,766
Well... has this picture...

911
00:52:03,933 --> 00:52:04,666
all right!

912
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,400
I think she was much better than he was.

913
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,260
These producers are so horribly down...

914
00:52:08,566 --> 00:52:09,366
They wont know how good she is...

915
00:52:09,533 --> 00:52:11,533
Well maybe it's because she's a good girl.

916
00:52:13,866 --> 00:52:16,933
All I mean is that it's not so bad..but
it's even less that I want to see.

917
00:52:17,066 --> 00:52:19,626
Darling, I think she's the most
precious little thing I've ever-

918
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,566
She's a knock out Libby.

919
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,999
You might mention that
when you write your review.

920
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,466
Unless the kids' a gold mine.

921
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,066
Did you like Norman Maine?

922
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,300
Was he in it?

923
00:52:31,333 --> 00:52:32,333
Libby?

924
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,740
I'm afraid we have another hit.

925
00:52:33,766 --> 00:52:34,833
It's in the bag.

926
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,600
Deeply tied up with beautiful pink ribbons.

927
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:39,000
Hey, where are Norman and Vicky?

928
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,509
I don't know, I thought you had them.

929
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:42,814
I wish they'd come, were
having a party at the Trocadero.

930
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,960
Isn't it thrilling running
away from people?

931
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,400
Norman, it's so exciting! So-

932
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,500
- So-
- So new.

933
00:52:51,367 --> 00:52:52,575
A star is born.

934
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,283
Come on!

935
00:53:03,575 --> 00:53:04,575
Wonderful, isn't it?

936
00:53:05,075 --> 00:53:06,242
A crazy quilt.

937
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:10,933
Well... It's a carpet spread for you...

938
00:53:12,968 --> 00:53:14,700
All yours from now on you know.

939
00:53:16,367 --> 00:53:18,200
You're a success

940
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:21,673
You can have everything
in the world you want.

941
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,033
Hope it'll make you happy.

942
00:53:26,366 --> 00:53:27,533
Doesn't it you?

943
00:53:30,783 --> 00:53:32,617
Well... That was one thing I never had...

944
00:53:33,908 --> 00:53:34,908
Lots of times I..

945
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:37,866
I told myself I'd find it but
I always knew I was lying.

946
00:53:40,533 --> 00:53:42,633
Still I... I never
stopped looking for it...

947
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:44,966
Maybe it'll come.

948
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,742
Well I think it has come Ester.

949
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,900
I only wish it weren't too late.

950
00:53:52,408 --> 00:53:53,825
Oh but it's not too late.

951
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:58,600
Oh you can't throw away your
life the way I've thrown away mine.

952
00:53:59,833 --> 00:54:02,266
I don't have anything left
that's good enough... now.

953
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:03,833
You can't...

954
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,325
Norman.. You can...

955
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:09,831
You mustn't tell me that, Esther.

956
00:54:12,117 --> 00:54:14,033
So afraid that I'll believe it.

957
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,166
Pick your right!

958
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:37,033
Swell, isn't it?

959
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:37,700
Lovely.

960
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,100
Let's watch again.

961
00:54:39,766 --> 00:54:42,033
He got ya... shoot your right!

962
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,900
Go!...He got him!

963
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,000
He did, didn't he?

964
00:54:51,166 --> 00:54:52,600
Yeah, but he'll be up, though.

965
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,433
You like it?

966
00:54:53,433 --> 00:54:54,000
Sure I do.

967
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:54,733
You like me?

968
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:55,900
Sure I do.

969
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,233
That reminds me. Will you marry me?

970
00:54:59,266 --> 00:55:00,266
No thank you.

971
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,099
Come on... finish him!
Why won't you marry me?

972
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,176
Because you're not dependable

973
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,200
Shoot your right!

974
00:55:05,333 --> 00:55:06,133
You throw away your money.

975
00:55:06,233 --> 00:55:06,600
Break him off!

976
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,066
And you drink so much.

977
00:55:10,033 --> 00:55:11,933
Cause i quit drinking

978
00:55:12,033 --> 00:55:12,700
Yes?

979
00:55:12,766 --> 00:55:14,966
Come on... Shoot your
right in there... the right!!

980
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,233
Cause I save my money.

981
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:16,700
Yes.

982
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,500
There he goes!...Let him have it!!

983
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,133
I'm absolutely dependable
on all occasions... Yes...

984
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,600
Yeah!

985
00:55:29,966 --> 00:55:33,166
He got ya... He got him... He got him!

986
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,033
He certainly did.

987
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,900
Yeah that was a beautiful fight!

988
00:55:47,266 --> 00:55:47,766
Norman?

989
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:48,493
Yes dear?

990
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,866
Would you do all that for
me if I said I'd marry you?

991
00:55:50,933 --> 00:55:53,966
No..certainly not... I'd just support you.

992
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,166
We're going to be married.

993
00:56:02,533 --> 00:56:03,973
Guess I didn't read that line right.

994
00:56:04,192 --> 00:56:05,192
I'll try it again.

995
00:56:05,947 --> 00:56:07,942
We are going to be married.

996
00:56:08,133 --> 00:56:08,766
Both of us.

997
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:09,966
To each other.

998
00:56:10,566 --> 00:56:11,606
What do you think of that?

999
00:56:11,733 --> 00:56:12,966
Well when? Where?

1000
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:15,066
Oh, we thought that we'd elope

1001
00:56:15,133 --> 00:56:16,400
In a conventional manner.

1002
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,400
What's the matter?

1003
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,966
Trying to decide whether
it's good for the studio.

1004
00:56:23,192 --> 00:56:24,192
Is it?

1005
00:56:24,266 --> 00:56:25,266
It is.

1006
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:26,866
Bless you my children.

1007
00:56:27,233 --> 00:56:28,033
When's it going to happen?

1008
00:56:28,133 --> 00:56:29,842
Oh we thought we'd
just sneak out some time.

1009
00:56:29,866 --> 00:56:31,166
W're not telling anyone but you.

1010
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:33,066
Listen to this!

1011
00:56:33,233 --> 00:56:34,800
The squeeze ideal romance

1012
00:56:34,833 --> 00:56:36,700
blossomed into breathing reality

1013
00:56:36,733 --> 00:56:38,533
Today when Vicky Lester and Norman Maine,

1014
00:56:38,666 --> 00:56:40,366
America's dream lovers

1015
00:56:40,633 --> 00:56:43,433
Slipped quietly thru the
portals of holy matrimony.

1016
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:44,733
How does it sound?

1017
00:56:45,333 --> 00:56:45,933
Horrible.

1018
00:56:46,033 --> 00:56:47,800
But you see we're going to elope.

1019
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:48,666
Sure you are!

1020
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,966
It will be the biggest
elopement this town ever saw.

1021
00:56:51,333 --> 00:56:52,576
We'll get a tie-up with the army

1022
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,533
and have you escorted
all the way down to Yuma

1023
00:56:54,666 --> 00:56:56,566
by twenty of their new bombing planes.

1024
00:56:57,442 --> 00:56:58,442
Is he going with us?

1025
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:02,076
Don't you think we can work
this thing out better alone?

1026
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,600
No sense in bothering the
happy couple with all the details.

1027
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,766
I'll see to it that you get a
carbon copy of the whole layout.

1028
00:57:07,833 --> 00:57:08,833
I can hardly wait.

1029
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:12,133
I'm sorry we didn't
realize we were in the way.

1030
00:57:12,633 --> 00:57:16,584
While you're settling the details, you don't mind
if I take this woman out and buy her a ring, do you?

1031
00:57:16,608 --> 00:57:18,692
Sure, go ahead, we want everything legal.

1032
00:57:20,566 --> 00:57:22,200
That's a charming match.

1033
00:57:22,833 --> 00:57:24,266
A nice girl like Vicky.

1034
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:26,366
And public nuisance number one.

1035
00:57:26,533 --> 00:57:27,166
Now wait a minute,

1036
00:57:27,333 --> 00:57:28,066
Norman's alright.

1037
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,676
And if you'll pardon my pointing,
Vickie's business is her own.

1038
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:31,940
It doesn't require any comment.

1039
00:57:32,033 --> 00:57:33,266
I wasn't making any comments.

1040
00:57:33,666 --> 00:57:35,133
I just said it's a rotting shame.

1041
00:57:35,233 --> 00:57:36,376
So go ahead and plan the elopement.

1042
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,933
Oh that elopement stuff is out.

1043
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:39,900
You can't get any scope in that.

1044
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,840
We are going to have a wedding.

1045
00:57:42,833 --> 00:57:43,833
Where will we have it?

1046
00:57:43,933 --> 00:57:45,533
Customary place I believe is a church.

1047
00:57:45,666 --> 00:57:46,166
Nah.

1048
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:47,500
Been done.

1049
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,600
This gotta be something big.

1050
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:52,100
The beach.

1051
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,400
I can visualize it.

1052
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:55,233
The bridesmaids in bathing suits.

1053
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,533
Twenty thousand Santa
Monica school children.

1054
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,300
Filling out the word love.

1055
00:58:04,108 --> 00:58:05,588
It's a novelty, but is it big enough?

1056
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:07,898
Why not the city hall?

1057
00:58:08,466 --> 00:58:09,500
A police escort.

1058
00:58:09,633 --> 00:58:11,633
Every motorcycle cop in town.

1059
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,566
Sirens screaming. Confetti
pouring out of buildings.

1060
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,633
Like the Lindbergh reception in New York.

1061
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,233
Only on a big scale.

1062
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,933
What's the matter? Isn't it big enough?

1063
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,333
And now if any man can show just cause

1064
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,966
why these two may not
be lawfully joined together

1065
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:32,372
let him now speak, or else
hereafter forever hold his peace.

1066
00:58:33,066 --> 00:58:33,733
Do you

1067
00:58:34,033 --> 00:58:35,033
Alfred Henkle

1068
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,233
take this woman as your lawful wedded wife?

1069
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:40,261
Will you love, comfort, honor and
keep her in sickness and in health?

1070
00:58:40,366 --> 00:58:41,866
As long as you both shall live?

1071
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:42,933
I will. Do you

1072
00:58:43,066 --> 00:58:44,066
I beg your pardon.

1073
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,000
Do you Esther Blodget take

1074
00:58:46,817 --> 00:58:48,142
this man as you your lawful wedded husband?

1075
00:58:48,166 --> 00:58:51,200
Will you obey, serve, love, honor
and keep him in sickness and in health?

1076
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,633
As long as you both shall live?

1077
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:54,500
I will.

1078
00:58:54,933 --> 00:58:56,433
Place the ring on her finger.

1079
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,000
And hurry please.

1080
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,133
Now by virtues of the power invested in me

1081
00:59:04,233 --> 00:59:07,366
as justice of the peace of

1082
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,933
I pronounce you man and wife.

1083
00:59:15,858 --> 00:59:17,067
Quiet!

1084
00:59:21,134 --> 00:59:24,317
And now I must exercise
my prerogative of office.

1085
00:59:26,733 --> 00:59:28,817
I hope you'll be very happy Mrs. Hinkle.

1086
00:59:28,933 --> 00:59:29,933
Thank you.

1087
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:31,400
Thank you, sir.

1088
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,433
Thank you very much.

1089
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,000
Now if you will please sign the license.

1090
00:59:35,433 --> 00:59:36,433
Oh, oh yeah.

1091
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,400
You know ahh.. Mrs. Hinkle...

1092
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:41,633
I can't help but believe I've
seen you somewhere before.

1093
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:42,866
Oh really?

1094
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:46,933
Oh well, uh, I believe this is the
first time I've ever been in San Bardo.

1095
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,576
You know your face is familiar
too. Really? Here you are.

1096
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,533
Thank you very much.

1097
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:51,400
Well thank you.

1098
00:59:51,533 --> 00:59:52,533
Thank you

1099
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:53,466
Good bye.

1100
00:59:53,533 --> 00:59:54,533
Good bye.

1101
00:59:54,566 --> 00:59:55,633
Norm!

1102
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:56,266
Nice to see you again...

1103
00:59:56,333 --> 00:59:57,933
No I just... coming darling.

1104
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:00,699
Ya I think he got by with it.

1105
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:01,700
But it was closed

1106
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,033
J.P. was just beginning to
remember where he'd seen it.

1107
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:05,666
Anyway we got away from Libby

1108
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:09,733
Hello, Sir!

1109
01:00:10,433 --> 01:00:14,200
If you would be kind enough to
glance between my shoulder blades.

1110
01:00:14,833 --> 01:00:16,233
Mr. and Mrs. Hankle.

1111
01:00:16,433 --> 01:00:17,999
You will find there a knife.

1112
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Buried to the hilt.

1113
01:00:19,433 --> 01:00:21,033
On the handle are your initials.

1114
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,533
Really good seeing you Libby!

1115
01:00:22,633 --> 01:00:23,933
Hold it Danny!

1116
01:00:34,442 --> 01:00:37,067
There comes a couple
of rats I raised from mice.

1117
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:39,709
Well, they've got a right
to get married haven't they?

1118
01:00:39,733 --> 01:00:41,853
You haven't got any right
to double cross the public.

1119
01:00:42,067 --> 01:00:43,150
I haven't done it yet

1120
01:00:44,067 --> 01:00:45,067
Hey!

1121
01:00:46,692 --> 01:00:47,812
People vs. Porky Washington.

1122
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,200
Who is charge with violating section 600...

1123
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,633
Now your in contempt of court!

1124
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:52,900
Operator?

1125
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:54,366
Los Angeles Tribune

1126
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:56,220
I have a good mind to put you under arrest!

1127
01:00:56,333 --> 01:00:57,600
Wait till i make this call

1128
01:00:58,358 --> 01:00:59,358

1129
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:00,900
Tribune!

1130
01:01:00,933 --> 01:01:01,933
Give me the city desk.

1131
01:01:02,666 --> 01:01:03,133
Johnny!

1132
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,400
This is Matt Libby

1133
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:05,666
I've got a flash for you.

1134
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,500
Norman Maine and Vicki Lester

1135
01:01:07,566 --> 01:01:09,766
were married at 2:30 this afternoon.

1136
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:10,833
Vicki Lester?!

1137
01:01:11,233 --> 01:01:12,533
Court recess!

1138
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,600
So give me a horse... a great big horse...

1139
01:02:01,633 --> 01:02:03,500
A great big buckeroo and

1140
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:07,466

1141
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,400
Wahoo!

1142
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:37,800
Waohoo.

1143
01:02:39,233 --> 01:02:40,233
Waohoo.

1144
01:02:41,233 --> 01:02:43,266
I don't want to sound immodest

1145
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,166
but i think I've stripped a gear

1146
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,600
Well sit down won't you
and let's get acquainted.

1147
01:02:47,733 --> 01:02:50,065
Probably be seeing quite a
bit of each other from now on.

1148
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:53,366
Might just as well break
the ice now as later

1149
01:03:00,083 --> 01:03:01,333
now we're old friends

1150
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,466
hey, have i got time for
a shower before dinner?

1151
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,866
Plenty, if you can find a shower

1152
01:03:08,366 --> 01:03:10,733
i never can remember where that thing is

1153
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,200
it pull out or slide under?

1154
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,600
Here, i think i can find it

1155
01:03:13,766 --> 01:03:15,633
nope, that's the linen closet

1156
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:17,167
here it is

1157
01:03:17,366 --> 01:03:18,366
Nice work.

1158
01:03:18,966 --> 01:03:20,700
Half the time those things are just luck

1159
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,433
ill see if i can disinfect this steak

1160
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,933
Hey Esther.
Uh, there's no soap.

1161
01:03:37,533 --> 01:03:38,600
Here.

1162
01:03:41,900 --> 01:03:42,766
Oh and Esther!

1163
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:43,233
Yes.

1164
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:44,666
I'll need a washcloth please

1165
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,866
How you fix the cigarettes?

1166
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,166
You know I never smoke underwater.

1167
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,300
What do I do to make this thing work?

1168
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,000
Pull that gadget at the
top and pray for rain.

1169
01:04:02,433 --> 01:04:03,433
Oh I...

1170
01:04:03,792 --> 01:04:06,375
i cant reach it, i cant get my hands up!

1171
01:04:07,233 --> 01:04:09,753
You go in there with your arms
down you'll never get your bath.

1172
01:04:10,066 --> 01:04:11,300
Unless you're a contortionist

1173
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:15,433
yea well, i..i'm not a contortionist
and don't throw that up to me now

1174
01:04:15,666 --> 01:04:17,066
you knew it, when you married me

1175
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:19,900

1176
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:26,600
Thank you.

1177
01:04:31,066 --> 01:04:32,966
OH... ow

1178
01:04:38,533 --> 01:04:40,933
Norman, Norman! Here comes the car.

1179
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
You gotta...

1180
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:42,700
Huh?

1181
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:43,533
Here, quick!

1182
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:44,300
Quick what?

1183
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,966
Quick go out and stop
them and ask for help.

1184
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:48,366
I'll catch a cold!

1185
01:04:48,831 --> 01:04:49,833
Get warm again.

1186
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,800
They'll recognize me

1187
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:53,140
not if you keep your face down!

1188
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,909
Go on, there may not
be another car for weeks!

1189
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:55,933
Oh I...

1190
01:04:59,566 --> 01:05:01,100
ah..ah..howdy partner!

1191
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:01,600
Howdy..ah

1192
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:02,600
stuck?

1193
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,000
Yeah, how'd you guess it?

1194
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:05,700
Can you get us some help?

1195
01:05:06,133 --> 01:05:07,366
Well, I reckon not.

1196
01:05:07,566 --> 01:05:08,933
You know it's a long way to town,

1197
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,076
We're pretty busy down at that place.

1198
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,266
Well, I got to get out of
here I got my wife with me.

1199
01:05:13,166 --> 01:05:13,966
She like the country?

1200
01:05:14,033 --> 01:05:14,600
No.

1201
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:16,200
And we're short of food.

1202
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,900
There's a lot of game in them woods

1203
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,900
well my wife can't shoot

1204
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,166
Well your sure up against it.

1205
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:22,400
Sorry I can't do anything

1206
01:05:22,433 --> 01:05:24,500
for you.
Wait listen I'll be frank with you.

1207
01:05:24,933 --> 01:05:25,933
I'm Norman Maine.

1208
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,200
Who?

1209
01:05:27,417 --> 01:05:28,417
Norman Maine!

1210
01:05:28,566 --> 01:05:29,700
My name is Jett Baker

1211
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:30,900
Glad to have met you.

1212
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Well so long.

1213
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,666
Hey wait a..wait a
minute..listen..you don't

1214
01:05:36,417 --> 01:05:38,333
So you are Norman Maine.

1215
01:05:56,733 --> 01:05:58,866
I've got my prestige to look out for.

1216
01:05:59,033 --> 01:06:01,366
I'm supposed to be the best
publicity man in the racket

1217
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,533
And they laughed
themselves sick when I even

1218
01:06:03,633 --> 01:06:05,233
try to get a decent mention of me.

1219
01:06:05,633 --> 01:06:08,676
Yes, i know how sensitive you are Libby.
I don't like to see your feelings hurt

1220
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:09,700
Thanks boss.

1221
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:10,433
Now Vicki,

1222
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:12,300
there's a dish for free space

1223
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:14,700
but if Maine swam across the Pacifi

1224
01:06:14,766 --> 01:06:16,300
the papers would keep it a secret

1225
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Well,

1226
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:20,300
the exhibitors don't like him,

1227
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:21,866
the critics don't like him,

1228
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,133
the public don't like him,

1229
01:06:23,366 --> 01:06:24,533
and I don't like him.

1230
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:26,500
Who likes him?

1231
01:06:34,833 --> 01:06:36,875
Oh but darling, this is almost too much.

1232
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:39,798
There i was in my touching innocence

1233
01:06:39,933 --> 01:06:41,576
thinking we were going
to live in the beach house

1234
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,120
oh, we'll still keep a place at malibu

1235
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,333
this is special, this is our
castle. It used to be in the air

1236
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,066
we will never use any ugly words like,

1237
01:06:49,166 --> 01:06:50,526
contracts and pictures and careers

1238
01:06:51,366 --> 01:06:52,486
When we come in those gates,

1239
01:06:53,166 --> 01:06:54,700
Check the studio outside.

1240
01:06:55,417 --> 01:06:57,257
Come on I got another
little surprise for you.

1241
01:07:14,733 --> 01:07:16,066
Oh Norman it's lovely.

1242
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,300
So are you, lovely

1243
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,766
The whole world is lovely.

1244
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Hey! Hold it!

1245
01:07:31,733 --> 01:07:32,900
That's it.

1246
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:34,400
Caption!

1247
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,433
Their honeymoon never ends.

1248
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:38,820
Alright, let's get some pictures.

1249
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:40,900
Now the bride will sit here.

1250
01:07:41,033 --> 01:07:42,600
And the groom stand behind her.

1251
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:44,200
You have something unique.

1252
01:07:47,866 --> 01:07:49,346
Now lets go after something different

1253
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,566
You sit down and she'll stand up.

1254
01:07:52,625 --> 01:07:53,625
Pretty radical isn't it?

1255
01:07:53,666 --> 01:07:55,400
Yea, but in a nice way

1256
01:07:57,066 --> 01:07:58,600
Ok Otto fire!

1257
01:08:00,100 --> 01:08:02,700
Caption. Their honeymoon begins a new.

1258
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:05,000
Wow, the producer.

1259
01:08:06,633 --> 01:08:08,633
Caption. Their honeymoon ceases abruptly.

1260
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:09,600
Hello Oliver

1261
01:08:09,733 --> 01:08:11,133
Oh I'm glad your back.

1262
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:12,700
Vicki, how well you're lookng.

1263
01:08:12,766 --> 01:08:13,766
Hello Oliver.

1264
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:14,900
Am I interrupting?

1265
01:08:15,033 --> 01:08:16,033
Yes, thank you.

1266
01:08:16,133 --> 01:08:17,276
Just want a couple more pictures

1267
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:18,460
that's enough of both of them

1268
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:20,700
what they're asking for are
exclusives of Miss Lester

1269
01:08:21,033 --> 01:08:22,033
alone!

1270
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:23,100
Oh i see

1271
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:25,426
come on Oliver, let you
and me get exclusive

1272
01:08:25,533 --> 01:08:26,533
see you later Vicky

1273
01:08:27,233 --> 01:08:30,133
don't worry, my camera
smashing days are over

1274
01:08:31,133 --> 01:08:32,500
danger only days are over

1275
01:08:33,166 --> 01:08:34,200
hold that Miss Lester

1276
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:37,300
gorgeous!

1277
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:39,300
Oliver!

1278
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,900
How's the dividend situation?

1279
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Very pleasant, i think we sold
two million on our next quarter

1280
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:46,940
smart move of mine to sell my stock eh?

1281
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:49,200
Oh well, when you need money you need it

1282
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:51,100
some people save up for just such an event

1283
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:54,060
there's bound to be a
rainy day occasionally

1284
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,306
Well as a citizen of California,
I've always refused to admit that

1285
01:08:56,330 --> 01:08:58,050
I know, but still it does rain

1286
01:08:58,090 --> 01:09:01,140
well anyways, you can thank me
for some of those dividends of yours

1287
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,400
can't you?

1288
01:09:05,830 --> 01:09:07,480
That was a little too quick Oliver

1289
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:10,800
Well then... Chanadora
was a smash hit wasn't he?

1290
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:13,600
They made Vicky a star overnight

1291
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,300
how about me?

1292
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:17,990
Well lets talk about
business at the office Norman

1293
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:19,600
beautiful pool you have here

1294
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:22,170
no, lets talk about it here

1295
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:23,900
do they like me?

1296
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:27,810
Maybe the part wasn't just right

1297
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,690
look, Oliver

1298
01:09:30,650 --> 01:09:32,420
you think I'm slipping?

1299
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,770
Can you take it?

1300
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:38,800
The tense is wrong. You're
not slipping, you've slipped.

1301
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:44,300
My fan mail is still big.

1302
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:47,310
Norman, Norman, fan will write
to anybody with a photograph.

1303
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:51,100
It only costs 3 cents for a stamp, and that
makes photographs cheaper than wallpaper

1304
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:54,900
But every 25 cents they pay for a theater
ticket buys them the right to be a critic.

1305
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:58,150
And your last few performances
Norman, have not pleased your critics

1306
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,700
you remember i told you I'd uh...

1307
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:07,900
be ready for the curtains
when the time came?

1308
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:11,000
Well here it is.

1309
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:16,030
Let's call off the
contract, no hard feelings

1310
01:10:16,770 --> 01:10:18,780
we're not quitting. Either of us

1311
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:20,600
there is no explaining these things

1312
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:23,700
we've all seen how the public
turns. Maybe we can turn them back

1313
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:25,860
I've got a swell skit lined up for you

1314
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:28,910
about... about Esther

1315
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,200
uh..

1316
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:32,700
You think that i'm going to get in her way

1317
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:35,900
well as a matter of fact as it happens,
there's no part in the story for her

1318
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,700
I'd more or less planned to
star her in a picture of her own

1319
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,400
With uh..that young Pemberton opposite her

1320
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:42,780
he's coming along nicely

1321
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,300
good for young Pemberton

1322
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:56,200
alright Oliver... let's make a
try at it. Lets hope it's not too late

1323
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,000
Get with the Oliver Niles Productions

1324
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:22,880
No argument... I'd buy those.

1325
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:31,800
Screens most finished actor... haha.. I'll say
he's finished... He keeps them a way in droves.

1326
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,100
Hello

1327
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:24,850
no... no Miss Lester isn't home as yet

1328
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,810
no I am not the butler

1329
01:12:29,210 --> 01:12:32,330
but I can take a message
just as well as he can honestly

1330
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:38,660
Oh... Is that you Norman? Swell!
Listen Norman this is Arty Carver

1331
01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:44,220
How are you kid? Swell. Say I
hear your thru with Oliver Niles...

1332
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:45,600
That on the Level?

1333
01:12:45,601 --> 01:12:49,000
Oh please Arty I'm not
news anymore forget it.

1334
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:51,800
Say what kind of a settlement
did you make on your contract?

1335
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:54,790
Give me a figure so I can do a story on it.

1336
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:58,099
No money involved...
we just called it quits.

1337
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:00,800
Ok, Ok, I'll fill in my own figure.

1338
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:06,600
Say by the way. I've been trying to get an interview
with Vicky for two weeks but she's always busy...

1339
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:10,900
How about you give an old pal a
break by speaking to her for me?

1340
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:12,740
Sure I'll ask her.

1341
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,500
Swell. So long. Heh

1342
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:31,000
I didn't mean to be late darling
but Kacy wanted me... It's all right.

1343
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:33,120
Your here now.

1344
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,300
What's new today?

1345
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:37,100
Nothing... Haven't been out of the house.

1346
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:40,180
Lets go somewhere tonight.

1347
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,700
Oh no no your tired we'll stay in.

1348
01:13:42,930 --> 01:13:44,580
I'm not tired really.

1349
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:48,100
Oh you are... you've got
a hard day ahead of you...

1350
01:13:48,700 --> 01:13:51,220
anyway I see you little of you
I'd like to have you to myself..

1351
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:54,980
Oh but it's the servents night out and we
haven't any dinner made... Yes we have...

1352
01:13:55,090 --> 01:13:57,760
I fix a little snake with
my own lily white hands.

1353
01:13:58,770 --> 01:13:59,770
Hey ah...

1354
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:04,000
I'm learning to cook in my spare
time. Then I think I'll marry you..

1355
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:06,500
Oh I get it.

1356
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,790
You want to make an honest cook of me huh?

1357
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:13,120
Comes in on wheels in this joint.

1358
01:14:33,030 --> 01:14:35,320
Here you are... how's it look?

1359
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,400
Hmm... wonderful!

1360
01:14:37,530 --> 01:14:39,760
That's what I thought.

1361
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:44,530
Now there don't be formal just pitch in.

1362
01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:49,490
Here you are.

1363
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:01,710
I'm afraid my mouths not quite big enough.

1364
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:06,900
I'll measure next time
and make them to size.

1365
01:15:07,190 --> 01:15:08,930
A little hard to nip too.

1366
01:15:10,700 --> 01:15:14,690
I'll take the hint... I'll take
those measurements right now.

1367
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:26,860
That's what I wait for...

1368
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:32,850
That's why I rush home without
even changing my costume.

1369
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:41,740
Wait.. We're forgetting that we're
hungry... Would you like a sandwich?

1370
01:15:42,210 --> 01:15:44,780
No Thank you I still have
a little work on this one.

1371
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:52,200
Now... Oh... Heh...

1372
01:15:55,270 --> 01:15:58,700
Norman will you unhook
my dress, I can't breathe

1373
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:04,850
And all the time I thought it was
the kiss that made you breathless.

1374
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:07,360
A lot of hooks, why
don't you have a zipper?

1375
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:09,510
Good idea

1376
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,700
feel better?

1377
01:16:22,310 --> 01:16:24,630
Don't look now but uh...

1378
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:30,100
I think that guy on your
left is in love with you

1379
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,600
Door bell. Is it?

1380
01:16:47,090 --> 01:16:48,510
Maybe they'll go away.

1381
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:51,900
Oh they never do at a time like this.

1382
01:16:54,090 --> 01:16:56,190
Just a minute dear... I'll be right back.

1383
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:06,200
Does Vicky Lester live here?
I've got a package for her

1384
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:08,070
and who are you?

1385
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:11,140
I'm her husband

1386
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,330
Sign right here Mr.Lester

1387
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,850
package for you

1388
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,690
by the way i forgot to tell you uh...

1389
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:45,100
they want you for a benefit shrine
auditorium next Wednesday night

1390
01:17:45,830 --> 01:17:47,110
told them i'd ask you

1391
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,800
darling, i don't want
to hear about that now

1392
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:53,400
you better wait till i finish
before i forget them all

1393
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:57,750
uhm.. the academy dinner secretary phoned

1394
01:17:57,770 --> 01:18:00,620
she wants to know if you
want a table reserved for you

1395
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:09,000
Oh Yes Arty Carver called and ask if I'd use
my influence with you to get him an interview.

1396
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:14,100
I told him I'd try. Ah
that was all I think.

1397
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:17,800
Oh Norman please don't
talk about those things now.

1398
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:20,820
We're forgetting the
wonderful food you prepared.

1399
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:25,300
Hmm... I'm not very
hungry now... I think I'll ah...

1400
01:18:25,610 --> 01:18:28,230
I'll fix a little drink. Hmm...

1401
01:18:30,590 --> 01:18:31,970
Norm...

1402
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:49,500
I wish Norman would come.

1403
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:51,110
Stop worrying.

1404
01:18:51,490 --> 01:18:53,776
Think how nice that statue is
going to look on your mantle piece.

1405
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,400
You suppose anythings happened to him?

1406
01:18:55,700 --> 01:18:59,140
Of course not, he's just been held up in
traffic. You just think about that statuette.

1407
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:04,800
Now we arrive at the climax of the annual dinner of
the Academy of Motion Picture of Arts and Science.

1408
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,540
The highest award within
our power to bestow.

1409
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:12,200
We've already uploaded with
our harts as well as our hands.

1410
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:14,759
While awards have been
given those gentleman

1411
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:18,960
who during the past year have rendered distinguished
service to the motion picture industry.

1412
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:21,520
We now pay honour to the ladies.

1413
01:19:22,010 --> 01:19:23,300
Or rather to one lady.

1414
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:28,400
We offer to her the academy award of
the finest performance of the past year.

1415
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,700
She has already had the world's acclaim

1416
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:33,050
but this is the tribute
of our fellow workers,

1417
01:19:33,270 --> 01:19:35,130
the men and women of this industry.

1418
01:19:35,400 --> 01:19:37,600
It is not only my pleasure but my privilege

1419
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:43,900
to give this award to the actress who created the
unforgettable actress of Anna in Green without end.

1420
01:19:44,830 --> 01:19:46,870
Miss Vicky Leicester.

1421
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:10,100
What more can we say miss
Leicester. This says it all for us.

1422
01:20:26,670 --> 01:20:31,510
Lady's and gentlemen's! When something
like this happens to you and you try to

1423
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,340
count how you feel
about it, you find out that

1424
01:20:34,940 --> 01:20:37,870
Out of the all the words in
the world there are only two

1425
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:41,500
words that would mean anything:

1426
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,876
Thank you! All I can do is to
say them to you from my heart.

1427
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:47,600
All I can do is

1428
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,400
All I can do is keep on saying them...

1429
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:56,400
Hey! That's fine. All this thing. Please! That's
a very pretty speech my dear. Very pretty!

1430
01:20:57,080 --> 01:20:59,000
You said what I think. I
wanna be the very first

1431
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:02,100
I wanna be the very first
to congratulate you. But..

1432
01:21:02,170 --> 01:21:06,110
I'm not a valuable piece of...
Now I wanna make a speech.

1433
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,230
Now I wanna make a speech.

1434
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:11,860
Gentleman of the Academy and fellow suckers

1435
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:17,600
I got one of those for the best performance, they
don't mean a thing. People get them every year.

1436
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:20,020
What I want is a special award.

1437
01:21:20,310 --> 01:21:22,360
Something nobody else can get.

1438
01:21:22,540 --> 01:21:26,190
I wanna statue of the worst
performance of the year.

1439
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:29,310
In fact I want three statues.

1440
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:33,640
For the three worst performances of
the year, because I've earned them.

1441
01:21:34,060 --> 01:21:36,390
And every single one of you

1442
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,800

of mine knows I've earned them.

1444
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:48,500
What I'm here to find out is,
do I get 'em or do I get 'em?

1445
01:21:49,740 --> 01:21:51,910
As or yes or no? ♪splash ♪

1446
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:03,230

Everyone missed you! Had a nice trip?

1457
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:20,400
Well the three months tour that get
us out of... because of out of pleasure

1458
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:24,170
But the way they were screaming
for your pictures all over the country,

1459
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:27,100
Esleka if I may talk shot you are Enaka.

1460
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:29,680
Thank you! Is good to hear that.

1461
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:33,180
You've been crying. A little

1462
01:23:34,340 --> 01:23:36,250
A little. How is Norman?

1463
01:23:36,830 --> 01:23:38,460
How is Norman?

1464
01:23:44,200 --> 01:23:46,700
Rough he's trying hard for all of us.

1465
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:51,060
Letting Norman leave the studio was the hardest
thing I ever do. There was nothing else I could do.

1466
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,100
There was nothing else I could do. I know.

1467
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:54,240
I know. Have you been.

1468
01:23:54,910 --> 01:23:57,780
Have you been .. Is he alright?

1469
01:23:58,070 --> 01:24:00,400
He got to the sanatarium

1470
01:24:01,300 --> 01:24:05,650
He really wanted that prix.
Now I think he could only...

1471
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:11,660
Well, I'll have to start working
again, it'll be some encouragement.

1472
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:16,590
Oliver, could you... could you do that?

1473
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:21,140
Oh, thank you. But he
mustn't ever know I told you.

1474
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:25,650
He won't know, and you mustn't worry. I
want you to keep up your good work in this

1475
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:30,400
It's the one thing I can do for you.

1476
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:41,500
If you'll just sit here, Mr.Niles, I'll have Mr. Maindorf down.
- Thank you.

1477
01:24:43,260 --> 01:24:44,920
Or not.

1478
01:24:57,700 --> 01:25:01,500
Hello Oliver! Welcome to Liberty Hall.

1479
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:04,300
Hello Norman. Well,

1480
01:25:05,050 --> 01:25:10,560
This is just a handshake

1481
01:25:11,150 --> 01:25:13,960
This is Cuddle, Oliver,
my social secretary.

1482
01:25:14,220 --> 01:25:15,980
We, we go everywhere together.

1483
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:17,800
How're you feeling Norman? Alright?

1484
01:25:18,050 --> 01:25:19,980
I'm getting on remarkably well,

1485
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:22,720
You oughta see some of the boys.

1486
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:24,850
Go sit down.

1487
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:30,690
Cuddles, we really don't need you.

1488
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:39,500
Are you comfortable here, Norman?
- Comfortable? It's positively luxurious.

1489
01:25:39,800 --> 01:25:44,500
They even have iron bars on the
windows to keep out the drought.

1490
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:48,700
How much longer are you gonna be here?

1491
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:53,710
Hang on for the next week
or two to get in good shape.

1492
01:25:53,830 --> 01:25:59,920
After all, there is no particular
hurry to return to the cameras.

1493
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:04,980
That's what I wanted to talk to you about. I've
got a script with a fine part for you in it.

1494
01:26:07,900 --> 01:26:11,000
Ah well that's great. That's great.

1495
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:14,500
Who... who plays opposite me?

1496
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:17,600
Well, it is not exactly the lead.

1497
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:22,500
Young Pimberton's doing that, but I tell you
frankly I find your part better than the lead.

1498
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:26,900
Huh. I see.

1499
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:29,400
Better than the lead?

1500
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:31,500
Of course it isn't terribly long,

1501
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:33,876
but it's one of those parts that
makes an impression on you.

1502
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:36,420
They'll be thinking about you all through the picture.
- Uh huh.

1503
01:26:36,850 --> 01:26:41,970
Well, the thing is Oliver, I'm, uh,
pretty well settled at another studio.

1504
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:48,060
And I'm not at liberty at the moment to tell you
which one, you know yourself how those things are.

1505
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:52,170
Big picture, One of the
biggest of the year and the part

1506
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:55,400
every actor in Hollywood
will give his teeth to play.

1507
01:26:55,720 --> 01:27:00,760
Well that's fine Norman, and naturally, that would tie you up
for a while, but we won't get to this picture for some time,

1508
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,876
and perhaps, if you want
to consider it for later on,

1509
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:05,200
Well, I tell ya Oliver, you
better not count on me.

1510
01:27:06,190 --> 01:27:11,210
See, I've got several pictures lined up after
this, and then they're talking to me about England

1511
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:14,699
You know, they're doing some
very interesting things over there

1512
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:16,000
Hey

1513
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,300
What is it? Cuddle speak
right out. We all love you.

1514
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,300
The dinner.
- Oh!

1515
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:26,000
We dine at five thirty here,
makes the nights longer.

1516
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:30,600
Now, goodbye Norman. I'm glad
to see you're getting along so well.

1517
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:31,900
I'll be out in no time.

1518
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:37,900
I'll have to introduce myself all over to a lot
of people, won't know when I'm not drinking.

1519
01:27:38,200 --> 01:27:38,900
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1520
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,600
Goodbye Norman.
- Thanks for dropping in.

1521
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:49,000
Well, cuddles... alone at last.

1522
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:57,500
Christmas Week
Racing
Santa Anita Park

1523
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:36,800
Oh, hello.

1524
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:37,800
-Hello
-Hello

1525
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:39,960
Hello, Norman.

1526
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:44,410
I see.

1527
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:49,490
How I hate to run into these has-beens.

1528
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:50,500
Give me the creeps.

1529
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:51,710
Me too.

1530
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:54,300
He was good while he had it.

1531
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:56,260
And he had it quite a while.

1532
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:59,300
-Hello
-Hello Mr. Maine

1533
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:02,100
- I haven't seen you in a long time.
- Ah, I've been resting

1534
01:29:02,930 --> 01:29:04,220
Ginger ale, please.

1535
01:29:04,530 --> 01:29:06,020
Ginger ale and what?

1536
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:09,100
Ginger ale and ginger ale.

1537
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:10,300
New leaf?

1538
01:29:10,390 --> 01:29:11,990
A whole new book.

1539
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:14,610
Thank you.

1540
01:29:17,180 --> 01:29:18,950
Scotch straight.

1541
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:20,600
Hello Libby

1542
01:29:21,550 --> 01:29:23,890
Why it's Mr. America of yesteryear.

1543
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:27,950
Do they let you wander
about now without a keeping?

1544
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:33,820
I didn't expect to find you an Santa Anita.

1545
01:29:34,430 --> 01:29:37,210
What do they do with the
actors when you're away?

1546
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:40,300
Oh, they cut them into
slices and fry them with eggs.

1547
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:48,390
Suppose you'll be here all the time

1548
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:53,300
Now that you've retired from
the hurly-burly of the silver screen.

1549
01:29:53,600 --> 01:30:00,200
Well, I'm living down in Malibu now. Pretty
lonesome with Esther away working all day.

1550
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:03,500
I wouldn't squawk about that if I were you.

1551
01:30:04,580 --> 01:30:07,090
It's nice having somebody
in the family making a living.

1552
01:30:07,220 --> 01:30:08,410
Oh Well, I'm gonna tell you.

1553
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,576
I don't want to forget that we're friends.

1554
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:14,000
Friends my eye. Say listen

1555
01:30:14,030 --> 01:30:18,560
I got you out of your jams because I had to,
it was my job not because I was your friend.

1556
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,300
I don't like you and I never have
liked you. Nothing made me happier

1557
01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:28,130
than to see all those cute little pranks of yours has finally
catch up with you and land you on your celebrated face!

1558
01:30:28,630 --> 01:30:33,220
Pretty work, Libby. Always wait
till they're down, then kick them.

1559
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:37,200
I don't feel sorry for you. You've
fixed yourself nice and comfortable.

1560
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:42,400
You can live off your wife now. She'll buy you drinks
and put up with you even though nobody else will.

1561
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:54,599
Wait a minute, Wait a minute...

1562
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:56,040
Come on outside for your right, pal!

1563
01:30:56,100 --> 01:30:57,200
I am Norman Maine!

1564
01:30:57,210 --> 01:31:00,020
Oh, Don't bother to throw him out.

1565
01:31:00,100 --> 01:31:02,076
- He's harmless.
- Alright, Mr. Libby if you say so.

1566
01:31:02,100 --> 01:31:05,600
We should let him go, What can he do?
He can't fight any better that he can act.

1567
01:31:05,740 --> 01:31:07,900
Norman Maine...

1568
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:31,300
Give me Scotch... double.
Leave the bottle here.

1569
01:31:38,020 --> 01:31:40,590
Vicki, you'll be ill.
Why don't you try to get some sleep?

1570
01:31:41,030 --> 01:31:44,010
He's been gone 4 days,
4 days and not a word.

1571
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:50,930
Oliver I can't.

1572
01:31:54,260 --> 01:31:59,730
Hello? No, this is Oliver
Niles speaking. What? Where?

1573
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:02,320
Thank you.

1574
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:02,900
What is it?

1575
01:32:02,930 --> 01:32:03,920
Nothing, nothing.

1576
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:05,110
Oliver tell me.

1577
01:32:05,200 --> 01:32:09,476
He's in the night court. He's been arrested on a drunk charge and
he's alright, isn't hurt and I'm going right now to get him out.

1578
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:10,100
I'm going with you.

1579
01:32:10,101 --> 01:32:12,199
Vicki, is isn't many place for
you and if it gets in the paper-

01:32:25,050 --> 01:32:26,940
The honorable judge Jeff Harris presiding.

1583
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,300
Be seated, Please.

1584
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:30,760
Oliver, did you do anything?

1585
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:32,460
The judge wouldn't even see me.

1586
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:33,760
Ready, Your honor.

1587

That's the best thing for him.

1648
01:36:40,450 --> 01:36:43,340
Is awful to see this
happen to someone you love

1649
01:36:43,700 --> 01:36:47,200
and know in your heart
that can't get any better.

1650
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:50,999
All I know that, All I can do now is stay
with him and try to help him.

1651
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:55,600
So am I.
Take care of him.

1652
01:36:55,630 --> 01:36:57,690
You'll very fond of him aren't you Oliver.

1653
01:36:58,100 --> 01:36:59,900
I'm very fond of both.

1654
01:37:01,670 --> 01:37:04,510
Then I know you'll understand
what I have to tell you.

1655
01:37:04,970 --> 01:37:10,750
After what happen last night, I think you already
know what it is. I can't do any more pictures.

I'm going away for good with Norman.

1657
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:18,400
You can't do that Vicki, You're in the very peak
of your success and you work so hard to achieve.

1658
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:26,500
This is for Norman, I thought it all out

1659
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:30,800
I know it's too late to
think about that now.

1660
01:37:30,900 --> 01:37:31,900
But...

1661
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:35,940
May not too be late to go away
with him and star over somewhere.

1662
01:37:36,050 --> 01:37:37,860
It's your life your giving up Vicki.

1663
01:37:39,870 --> 01:37:42,940
So I can try to get norman back his.

1664
01:37:44,950 --> 01:37:48,120
Can you honestly tell
me I'm wrong to do it.

1665
01:37:50,340 --> 01:37:54,560
No Vicki, I can't honestly tell you that.

1666
01:37:57,500 --> 01:38:02,300
Then there'll be no more Vicki Lester.

1667
01:38:06,030 --> 01:38:07,820
Come on, walk to the door with me.

1668

Goodbye, Vicki Lester.
You were a grand girl.

1669

1670
01:39:45,500 --> 01:39:46,900
Darling!

1671
01:39:49,500 --> 01:39:52,199
Maine coming in to apologize again.

Stop, I'm sorry Dear, but

1673
01:39:55,900 --> 01:39:57,500
It isn't you

1674
01:39:58,600 --> 01:40:00,700
What other troubles have you got?

1675
01:40:00,900 --> 01:40:02,400
None.

1676
01:40:03,300 --> 01:40:06,500
I was just playing a scene with myself.

1677
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:12,100
Now look, I'm just coming out of the
jitters and your just going into them.

1678
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:15,300
This is swell housefold.

1679
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:16,700
Isn't it?

1680
01:40:16,790 --> 01:40:22,160
Tell you what we'll do. I promise
to brace up, you go on the wagon.

1681
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:25,940
I cannot have been drinking too mch.

1682
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:30,700
What I'm gonna do, I'm
going to be an athlete.

1683
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,700
You mean with great big
muscles and everything.

1684
01:40:33,790 --> 01:40:35,790
Well, roughly speaking.

1685
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:39,299
Gonna join the YMCA?

1686
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:43,000
No, cost too much. Now I'm
going waiting out on the front yard.

1687
01:40:44,090 --> 01:40:45,560
-Now
-Sure!

1688
01:40:46,130 --> 01:40:47,810
Do you like me to go with you?

1689
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:50,160
Sure, if you like to.

1690
01:40:50,970 --> 01:40:56,090
Norman, I don't think I will.
It might spoil this beatiful natural waves.

1691
01:40:56,900 --> 01:40:58,200
Yeah, I get that's right.

1692
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:01,400
Darling, look.

1694
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:07,199
A hot soup.

1695
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:09,200
And I make one some
of those nice sandwiches.

1696
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:12,040
Norman, do you have to?

1697
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:26,700
- Come on now.
- Don't stay out too long

1698
01:41:32,830 --> 01:41:34,330
Hey!

1699
01:41:36,770 --> 01:41:40,330
Do you mind if I take
just... one more look?

1700
01:42:35,820 --> 01:42:41,500
<i>Norman Maine's body found of Malibu
Ex-Star perishes in tragic accident!</i>

1701
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:51,600
First drink of water he had in twenty
years. Then, he had to get it by accident.

1702
01:42:54,700 --> 01:43:00,400
But how do you write
congratulations to the Pacific Ocean?

1703
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:07,800
There he is now!

1704
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:10,020
Oh! You can't see a thing.

1705
01:43:12,370 --> 01:43:14,130
Hello Vicki!

1706
01:43:30,300 --> 01:43:33,499
- Get away, can't you?
- Come on, Vicki! Let's see your face.

1707
01:43:33,500 --> 01:43:36,500
Vicki, will you sign my book for me?
Write "This is Norman Maine".

1708
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,800
Don't you care, Vicki. You'll get over it.

1709
01:43:41,100 --> 01:43:42,900
Stand back, can't you?

1710
01:43:44,120 --> 01:43:46,760
Don't you cry, dearie! He wasn't so much!

1711
01:44:12,220 --> 01:44:17,960
Do you mind if I take
just... one more look?

1712
01:44:39,630 --> 01:44:41,930
Here are the paychecks
for the servants, Graves.

1713
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:44,330
You'll find a very nice bonus in each one.

1714
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:47,500
Miss Nasta asked me to thank
you for your kindness and service.

1715
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:51,000
If there is anything i can do for the
little lady, i should be glad to do it.

1716
01:44:51,100 --> 01:44:54,300
She would appreciate
your attending to the??

1717
01:44:54,510 --> 01:44:56,330
Be careful with that!

1718
01:44:56,700 --> 01:44:58,900
Put it down, I say!

1719
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:02,299
Well? Where is she?

1720
01:45:02,300 --> 01:45:04,100
I-In the bedroom, who are you?

1721
01:45:04,200 --> 01:45:07,200
Oh, I'm her grandmother.
Get out of the way!

1722
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:10,700
Hey

1723
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:13,400
Granny, darling!

1724
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:18,200
Oh I'm so glad to see
you. What made you come?

1725
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:20,000
Oh I know when I'm needed.

1726
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:23,099
Now get out of here! Go
on, get out of here, all of you!

1727
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:25,280
I want to talk to my grand-daughter alone.

1728
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:28,199
I came just as quickly as i could.

1729
01:45:28,200 --> 01:45:30,900
But I'm going home. I
sent you a ride yesterday.

1730
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:37,000
Hm! Sit down!

1731
01:45:40,680 --> 01:45:42,580
Is it true that you're
going to uit the movie?

1732
01:45:43,100 --> 01:45:44,800
I never want to hear them again.

1733
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:49,200
What"re you running away from?

1734
01:45:50,600 --> 01:45:52,500
I'm not running away.

1735
01:45:53,010 --> 01:45:55,640
It's just that i can't go on.
My heart isn't there anymore.

1736
01:45:57,200 --> 01:46:01,200
Once i told you to get what you want
to have to give your heart in exchange

1737
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,700
And you said, you will win, remember?

1738
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:06,610
I remember.

1739
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:10,800
Seems to me that you got more
than you were bargaining for.

1740
01:46:10,830 --> 01:46:15,530
More fame. More success.
Even more, personal happiness.

1741
01:46:15,900 --> 01:46:18,700
Maybe, more unhappiness.

1742
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:25,109
But you did make a bargain
and now you're whining over it.

1743
01:46:25,110 --> 01:46:29,230
I don't think i'd feel so very
proud of myself, if i were you

1744
01:46:29,900 --> 01:46:33,000
I'm not Granny, my mind's made up

1745
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:39,500
But Granny-
I was proud of you Esther.

1746
01:46:39,550 --> 01:46:43,399
I was proud to be the
grandmother of Esther.

1747
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:48,600
It gave me something to
live for. Now, I haven't any.

1748
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:56,050
I know. i wanna be
strong but I can't go on.

1749
01:46:56,900 --> 01:47:00,900
You must. Tragedy is a test of courage.

1750
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,700
If you can meet it bravely, it will
leave you bigger than it found you.

1751
01:47:04,840 --> 01:47:08,710
If not, then you'll have to
live all your life as a coward.

1752
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:13,330
Because no matter where you may
run, you can never run away from yourself.

1753
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:17,730
I never knew Norman Maine.

1754
01:47:17,950 --> 01:47:21,110
He wrote me a very sweet
letter when you were married.

1755
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:25,010
He said you told him
how much I meant to you.

1756
01:47:25,180 --> 01:47:29,520
And I know just how much
you must meant to him.

1757
01:47:30,600 --> 01:47:34,890
You know, Esther. I can't
believe that whenever you meet

1758
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:36,800
he can be very happy

1759
01:47:36,830 --> 01:47:42,560
knowing that he just broke the spirit
of the little girl he praised me so highly

1760
01:47:42,630 --> 01:47:46,100
and I can't believe that
he can be very proud

1761
01:47:46,190 --> 01:47:50,420
knowing that all the great love is to you

1762
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:54,200
was to make me a Putter

1763
01:47:56,020 --> 01:48:00,250
The car is ready Ms. Esther. You'll
have to go now to make the train.

1764
01:48:05,820 --> 01:48:08,720
Put the car back in the garage.

1765
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:33,080
The girl who has won
the heart of Hollywood.

1766
01:48:33,130 --> 01:48:35,170
The girl who has won
the heart of the world.

1767
01:48:35,210 --> 01:48:37,040
Ms. Vicki Lester!

1768
01:48:37,100 --> 01:48:41,880
And if i'm not mistaken, Ms.
Lester's car has just been arrived.

1769
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:44,500
Yes, it is here!

1770
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:02,500
I scare very slowly, young man!

1771
01:49:02,520 --> 01:49:04,280
Smile folks, please!

1772
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:11,450
They'll have your mug-

1773
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:16,100
I mean, your face plastered across half
the papers in the country tomorrow
- Hm how do i look?

1774
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:18,210
Oh you look well

1775
01:49:18,300 --> 01:49:20,000
You're a liar, but I like ya.

1776
01:49:20,010 --> 01:49:21,780
And here Mrs. Lester Grandmother.

1777
01:49:22,290 --> 01:49:24,530
Would you say a few words
to the radio audience, please?

1778
01:49:24,860 --> 01:49:26,060
Say something, lady

1779
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:32,700
You know, we've got a thing like that back home where
they all listen You know but we call it a pathy-line

1780
01:49:33,610 --> 01:49:36,040
Won't you say something,
please? They're listening.

1781
01:49:38,460 --> 01:49:42,840
Maybe some of you people listening
in dream about coming to Hollywood.

1782
01:49:42,890 --> 01:49:45,970
Maybe some of you will
get pretty discouraged.

1783
01:49:46,370 --> 01:49:49,980
Well, when you do, you just think about me.

1784
01:49:50,290 --> 01:49:52,250
It took me over seventy...

1785
01:49:53,130 --> 01:49:57,220
Sixty years to get here, but here I am

1786
01:49:57,420 --> 01:49:59,550
and here I mean to stay.

1787
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:02,300
Thank you very much.

1788
01:50:13,490 --> 01:50:15,050
Miss Lester

1789
01:50:19,300 --> 01:50:21,400

an international hookup.

1790
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:24,620

that you'll say a few words to them.
